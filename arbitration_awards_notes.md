# Notes on Interest Arbitration Awards

## General Structure

**Each arbitrator has template which they use to format the awards. This formatting will assist in writing rules to help split the text into sections (especaially if formatting of OCR'ed pds if maintained using ABBYY)**

### Cure, I:

I.  PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND

II.  PROPOSALS 

> A. FINAL UNION PROPOSALS

>> * Proposed removals are bold and strikethrough
>> * Proposed additions are bold and underlined

> B. FINAL "INSERT EMPLOYER" PROPOSALS

>> * Same Formating as A

III. STIPULATIONS OF THE PARTIES 

* Items over which the parties agreed to during arbitration

IV. STATUTORY CRITERIA

V. BACKGROUND

VI. THE PARTIES DISCUSSION OF THEIR RESPECTIVE PROPOSALS (wording varies but usually contains DISCUSSION)

VII. AWARD 

Note: The Roman numerals are sometimes incorrectly numbered, and some sections are skipped in certain awards. This requires the custom-built splitter to identify sections based on keyword rather than section number.
