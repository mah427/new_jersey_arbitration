BACKGROUND

The County describes itself as "the secand largest county in the state
containing 638 square miles of pine barrens and barrier islands and a 45-mile
coastline along the Atlantic Ocean." The County's census population in 2010
was 576,567, As of July 1, 2018, ihe County's papulation was estimated to be

601,651.

The County hos 21 bargaining units, seven (7) of which are low
enforcement unifs. PBA Local No. 258 represents the Caunty's Carrection
Officers, excluding Sergeants, Lieutenonts and Captains. The duratian of the

parties" most recent Agreement is from April 1, 2016 through June 30, 2019.

As of June 30, 2019, there were 174 bargaining unit members in Local 258.
Accarding fa PBA Local Union President Lucian Waods, there are currenity 171

borgaining unit members in the unit. [1:14].

The parties presented a vast amaunt of evidence during the praceedings.
They also submitted detailed, comprehensive briefs and certifications to support
iheir respective positions and to rebut those of the opposing party. The parties
urge the acceptance of their respective proposals. As the arbitrator noted in W

Windsor Tp & PBA Locat 271, 1A-2009-014 (Mastriani 2019}, the strict and limited

18
fime constraints under the law do not permit the arbitrator to provide an

exhaustive summary of the evidence presented, However, these submissions

have been thoroughly reviewed and considered in rendering a final Award on

the parties’ proposals.

DISCUSSION

Lam required to make a reasonable determination of the issues, giving

due weight to the statutory criteria set forth in NJS.A. 34:13A-Té{g}. The

 

statutory criteria are as follows:

(1)

Q)

The interests and welfare of the public. Among the items the
arbitrator or panel of arbitrators shall assess when considering
this factor are the limitations imposed upon the employer by
{(P.L. 1976, c. 68 (C. 40A:4-45.1 ef seg.}.

Comparison of the wages, salaries, hours. and conditions of
employment of the employees involved in the arbitration
proceedings with the wages, hours, and conditions of
employment of other employees performing the same or
similar services and with other employees generally:

{a} In private emplayment in general provided,
however, each parly shall have the right fo
submit additional evidence for ihe arbitrator's
consideration,

(5) In public employment in general: provided,
however, each party shall have the right fo
submit additional evidence for the arbitrator's
consideration

19
(3)

(4)

(5)

16)

{7}

 

In public empieyment in the same or similar
comparable jutisdictions, as determined in
accordance with section 5 of PL. 1995. C. 425
(C.34:13A-16.2) pravided, however, each party
shall have the right to submit additional evidence
concerning the comparability of jurisdictions for
the arbitrator's consideration.

The overall compensation presently received by the
employees, inclusive of direct wages, salary, vacations,
halidays, excused leaves, insurance and pensions, medical
and hospitalizotion benefits, and all otner economic benefits
received.

Stipulations of the parties.

The lawful authority of the employer. Among the items the
arbitrator or panel of arbitrotors shall assess when considering
this factor are the limitations imposed upon the employer by
the P.L. 1976 c. 68 (C.40A:4-45 ef seq.}-

The financial impact on the governing unit, its residents and
taxpayers. When considering this factor in a dispute in which
the public employer is a county or a municipality, the
arbitrator or panel of arbitrators shall take into accaunt to the
extent that evidence is introduced, how the award will affect
the municipal or county purpeses element, as the case may
be, of the lecal property tax: a comparison of the
percentage of the municipal purposes element, or in the
case of a county, the county purposes element, required fo
fund the employees’ contract in the preceding local budget
year with thet required under the award for the current local
budget year: the impact of the award for each income
sector of the properly taxpayers on the local unit; the impact
of the award on the ability of the governing body to (al
maintain existing focal progroms and services, [b) expand
existing local programs ond services for which public moneys
have been designated by the goveming body in a proposed
local budget, or {¢} initiate any new programs and services
for which public moneys have been designated py the
governing body in its proposed local budget.

The cost of living.

20
{8} The continuity and stability of employment including seniority
fights and such other factors not confined to the foregoing
which are ordinarily or traditionally considered in the
determination of wages, hours and conditions of employment
through collective negotiations and collective bargaining
between the parties in the public service and in private
employment.

(9) Statutory restrictions imposed on the employer. Among the
items the arbitrator or panel of arbitrators shall assess when
considering this factor are the limitations imposed upon the
employer by section 10 of P.L. 2007, c. 62 (C.-40A:4-45.45).

All of the statutory factors are relevant, but they are not necessarily
entitled to equal weight. |. am required to make a reasonable determination of
the issues with a reasoned explanation for the award. | must also indicate which
statutory factors are deemed relevant, the due weight that was given to each
factor, and which factors, if any, are deemed to be irrelevant. The criteria also
provide me with the authority to consider other such factors net confined to
those specifically stated which are ordinarily or iraditionally considered in the
determination of wages, hours and conditions of employment. [N.J.S.A. 34:13A-
14(g)(8)]._In this case, | conclude that the interests and welfare of the public,
the public sector comparisons {intemal and external), and the financial impact
on the governing unit, its residents, and taxpayers must be given greater weight
than such other factors as the cost of living and private sector comparisons. |
have also given due weight to the fact that this Award will not require the
County to exceed its lawful authority or any statutory restrictions. The party
seeking a change fo an existing term or condition of employment bears the

a1
burden of justifying the proposed change, | have considered my decision to
award or deny any individual issue in dispute as part of the overall terms that |
have awarded, along with the continuation of contract terms and benefits that

are not in dispute.

lnterests and Welfare of the Public

Interest Arbitrators in New Jersey have widely recognized that “[tlhe
interests and welfare of the public [N.J.S.A. NJS.A. 34:13A-16g/1)] is paramount
because itis a criterion that embraces many of the other factors and recognizes
their relationships." Washington Tp & PBA Local 30?, 1A-2009-053 (Mastriani 2012);
see ivington Tp & trvington Police Superior Officers Association. (A-2019-010
{Osborn 2019}; W Windsor Tp & PBA Local 271, |A-2009-014 {Mastriani 2019):
Boonton & PBA Local 212, 1A-2019-021 (Kronick 2019]. I now review the interests

and welfare criterion through the other statutory factors addressed below.

Lawful Authority of the Employer/Financial Impact on the Governing Unit, Its
Residents and Toxpayers/Statulory Restrictions Imposed on the Empioyer
NSA. 34:12A-16g(1], (5). (6) and (9) refer to the lawful authority of the
employer, the financial impact of the award, and fhe statutory restrictions
imposed on the employer. The PBA contends that the County “has not

presenied sufficient. substantial, and/or concrete evidence to establish an

22
inobility to pay P.B.A #258 members the wage increases and other economic
incentives thai have been requested." [PBA Brief, p. 122]. It is true thot the
County does not claim an inability to pay up to the statutory permitted levels,
bul it submits that the PBA’s Final Offer “is clearly an excessive demand that will
hove a substantial negative impact on the County beth in the short term and in
the future: especially since it will have a huge impact on negotiations with the
County's other 20 unions." [County Brief, p. 92]. | conclude that the evidentiary
record developed during this proceeding does not require the awarding of
either party's proposals in their entirety. This Award will not have an adverse
impact upon the County, its taxpayers and residents, and it will not prohibit the
County from meeting its statutory obligations or cause it to exceed its lawfu)
authority. Further, this Aword serves fhe interests and welfare of the public

through a thorough weighing of all of the statutory criteria.

Comparability

Private Employment

Given the unique nature of public safety positions, the comparison to
private employment has not been allotted significant weight in previous interest
orbifration awords. There continues to be an absence of evidence to support a

deviation fram giving greater weight ta public sector comparisans.

23
Public Employment in Generai/in ihe Same or Similar Jurisdictions

With respec! to public employment. the PBA presented comparisons of
this bargaining unit inckided, but were not timmited io (1) low enforcement
officers within the municipal police departments in Ocean County, (2)
Corrections Officers in cauniy facilities statewide, and (3) the County's civilian
bargaining unifs. The County presented a general comparison of this
bargaining unif to public and private employment. The County cantends that
the internal comparability of its 21 bargaining units, including the likelihood that
this award would give substantial weight jo the internal comporabilily factor
and/or a pattern of settlement tor 2019 and 2020, must be given greater weight
than the PBA's Comparison with other municipal police officers in Ocean
County. | noie that the collective negotiations agreements between the
County and its six [6] other law enforcement units (Corrections Superiors - PBA
Local 258A, Sheriff's Officers — PBA Local 379, Sheriff's Superiors — PBA Local 379A.
Prosecutor's Detectives and investigators - PBA Local 171, Prosecutor's
Sergeants’ Association, and Prosecutor's Superior Officers Association) all have
on expiration date of June 30, 2019 and, as of the date of the interest arbitration

hearing, had not reached terms for successor contracts.

PERC's website inciudes the most recent salary increase analysis for

interest arbitration awards for calendar years 2012 through 2017. The average

24
increase for post-2011 2% cases was 1.71% for calendar year 2015, 1.94% for
2016, and 2.05% for 2017. The average increase for non-interest arbitration
settiements in 2016 was 3.16% and 3.53% in 2017. | considered this information in
tendering the Award, but | emphasize that the 2% base salary "Hard Cap" has
sunset and, therefore. the awards and settlements that were seni under the cap

are not dispositive as to the outcome of fhis matter.

PERC's website also includes four (4) interest arbitration awards that have
been issued for post-2% base salary “Hard Cap” impasses: Hopewell Tp & PBA
Loc 342, |A-2019-016 (Osborn 2019) appealed buf affirmed by Commission
P.E.R.C. No. 2020-11 (8/15/19), Bedminster Tp & PBA Loc 366, IA-2019-017 (Kronick
2019] appeaied but affirmed by Commission P.E.R.C. No. 2020-10 (8/15/19), W
Windsor Tp & PBA Local 271, IA-2009-014 (Mastriani 2019}, and Boonton & PBA
Loc 212, |A-2019-021 {Kronick}. Each award pertained to a law enforcement
unit in a municipality. In each instance, the collective negotiations organization
proposed fo reduce the Tier 4 levels that bargaining unit members were
required ta contrioute towards health benefits. In each instance, the arbitrator
did riot award the propasal. As ta base salary, the arbitrator in Hopewell froze
the starting salary for 2019 through 2021. increased all other steps Gn the 2019
guide by 2.2%, increased the iop step by 2%. added one [1] step, and froze alll
other steps in 2020, and for 2021 increased all steps {except starting salary) by

18%. Step advancernent was provided in eoch year of the contract In

25
Bedminster, the arbitrator froze the salary guide for 2019 except the lap siep
which was increased by 2%. The arbitrator then awarded across-the-board
increases of 2% ir: 2019, 2% in 2020, and 2% in 2021. Step advancement was
provided in each year of the contract. in W Windsor, the arbitrator awarded
across-the-board increases of 2% in 2019, across-the-board increases af 2% in
2020, across-thé-board increases 2.25% in 2021, and across-the-board increases
of 2.25% in 2022. Sfep advancement was provided in each year of the
contract. Lastly, in Boonion, the arbitrater awarded across-the-board increases
of 2.25% plus a $1,000 adjustment at the top step in 2019, across-the-board
increases of 2.25% plus a $1,000 adjustment at the top step in 2020, and across-
the-board increases 2.25% plus a $1,000 adjusiment at the top sfep in 2021. Step
advancement was provided in each year of the contract. in each award, the
osbitrator reviewed the evidence cansidered fo be the most unique and

relevant in cach of the municipalities.

| also teviewed the parties’ internal comparisons. The PBA emphasized
that “the County's civilian bargaining units were not subjected to the restrictions
of the wo percent (2%) solary cap as their members do nat serve as law
enforcement officers and, thus, cannot avali themselves of the interest
arbitration process. As such, as compared to their law enforcement
counterparts, many County civilian bargaining unit employees were able fo

secure somewhat generous percentage increases to their salaries for the several

26
years during the twa percent (2%) salary cap's existence and applicability.”
{PBA Brief, p. 69]. Moreover, “during fhat some period of time the salary guide
for P.B.A. #258 members was dramatically expanded and the maximum salary
afforded to members remained stagnant.” [ic], The PBA stressed thot "pattem
of setlement™ does not exist at this time and cannot control the outcome of this
matter. The County emphasized other factors. For instance, the County
indicated that of its “approximately 1.850 full-time employees and a few
hundred port-time employees" that “65 out of the top 300 paid County
employees are Corrections Officers." [Id. at 79: see Ex, C-1-103]. Moreover, “all
settlements for Ocean County CBAs expiring in 2020 and 2021 provide for a 1.9%
or flat dollar increase for 2019 and 2020. [See Ex. C-1-100]. The County also
emphasized thot all other County employees continue to contribute at Tier 4
levels for their health benefits. All of the Internal and external comparisons were.

considered and weighed along with ail of ihe other stotutory factors.

As to corrections officers in other counties in New Jersey, the PBA indicates
that the bargaining unit fils within the “middle of the pack” of the comparisan
group that it views as “the most appropriate comparison" for its salary proposal.
[PBA Brief, p. 65]. The PBA presented comparison charts. [fef. at 65-67]. Based
upon the PBA’s charts, which include comporative data for Bergen, Monmouth,
Middlesex, Mortis, Passaic and Hudson. fop salaries on salary guides range fror

$91,278 {Camden} to $126,642 [Bergen], with Local 258’s at $93,748 (Step 15}

27
(and off-guide of $96581). Based upon the PBA's charts, which include
comparative data for Morris, Bergen, Gloucester, Essex and Camden, starting
salaries range from Lacal 258’s at $40,000 to $47,352 (Marts). Based upon the
PBA's charts, which include comparative data for Essex, Mercer, Bergen,
Middlesex, Possaic, Warren. Union, Hudson, Salem, Atlantic, Sussex, Camden,
Gloucester, Somerset, Monmouih. Moris, Cumberland, Hunterdon and
Burlington, sieps on the salary guides ronged from six (4) (Essex} to 16 (Burlington
and Hunterdon), with Local 258's at 15. The County submits that this bargaining
“compares very favorabiy" to carrections officers in oiher counties in New
Jersey. [County Brief, p. 83}. The County provided comparison charts which
include corrections officers in 20 counties. [Exs. C-1-57 & C-1-58]. Based upon
jhe County’s camparisons, top salaries on salary guides range from $63,700
{Hunterdon} to $126,642 (Bergen}, with Local 258's at $93,748 (and off-guide of
$94,581), starting salaries range from $29.802 {Union} to $47,952 (Morris). with
Local 258's at $40,000, and! steps on the salary guides ranged from six (6) (Essex)

to 16 (Burlingtan and Hunterdan). with Local 258’s at 15

With respect to 31 local law enforcement units within Ocean Caunty
municipalities, the PBA submits that it does not compare fovorably to this
comparisan group. Based upon the P8A’s charts, top salaries an solary guides
range from $66,274 (Island Heights} to $157,481 (Toms Rivers}, with Local 258's ot

$93,748 (Step 15) {off-guide of $96,581). [PBA Brief, pp. 60-61]. Bosed upon the

28
PBA's charts, starting salaries range from $34,392 {Ocean Gate) to $56,290
(Jackson), with Local 258's at 40,000. [Id. at 63-64]. Based upon the PBA’s
Charts, steps on the salary guides ranged from seven (7} (island Heights} to 22

(Long Beach}, with Local 258's at 15. [Id at 62].

Ihave reviewed the parties’ comparisons. In sum, the comparables show
that the County's Corrections Officers have 0 competitive salary and benetits
package that does not require significant improvement or diminution at this

time.

Overall Compensation

The evidence in this matter, as demonstrated by the parties’ exhibits and
the comporisons outlined above, shows [hat the overall compensotion received
by the County’s Corrections Officers is competitive. | conclude that the
evidence does not require full implementation of either party’s final offer. This
Award will serve the interests and welfare of ihe public by siriking a balance
between maintaining the County's fiscal stability and providing bargaining unit
members with measured economic improvements to base salary. This Award
takes into consideration that the Counly has established the existence of strong
internal comparisons for its nan-law enforcement units in 2019 ond 2020 for solary

increases and the status quo of Tier 4 contributions toward health benefits. as

29
well as giving due weight to the comparisons of corrections officers statewide.
Local Jaw enforcement settlements were considered but given lesser weight
than the other comparison groups as each municipality has its own unique
bargaining history. socio-economic profile and tax rate structure. This Award
mointains the structural integrity af the current solary guide wilh some

improvement to the top step while allowing off-quide percentage increases that

fall in line wiih the internal comparisons.

| considered this criterion but give it lesser weight than such factors as the
County's ability to pay, the lack of adverse financial impact, the interests and

welfare of the public, and public sector comparability.

Continuity and Stability of Employment

This criterion was considered in my review of the evidence. The evidence
does not show a significant deviation in the number of Corrections Officers in
the bargaining unit. In 2018, there were 174 Comections Officers in the
bargaining unit. One (1} Corrections Officer resigned that year. [Ex. C-1-85]. In
2019, there were 171 Corrections Officers in the bargaining. That year, three (3)
Corrections Officers resigned, one (1) retired, one [1) passed away, and ane (1}
wos terminated. [Id.]. Warden Sandra Mueller testified that the County has
maintained a complement of over 170 Corrections Officers despite the fact that

the average daily population has decreased from 688 in 2014 to 377 in 2019.

The County acknowledges that the PBA's proposal up to "New Section B”
memorializes the current practice. but Ihe County opposes the remainder of the
PBA's proposal given that no other Counly employee receives such a benefit,
bargaining unit members “already receive a significant amount of time off”,
and “granting this proposal could increase the County's averlime cost ond

increase the likelihood af mandatory overlime which would creale @ hardship

for both ihe County and C.O.s". [Caunty Brief. pp. 56-57].

covered for up to one [1} year at full pay. All other existing
County policies reloting io on the job injury benefits shall be
continued.

Upon the execution of this Agreement, full pay shall be
limited to sixty (60) calendar days. Shouid an employee be
traumatically injured due to a violent atfack by an

hot possible due to the shift the officer works, then they may
attend the prescribed rehabilitatian session during on-duty
hours and may use sick time ar any ofher leave entitlement or
may chase to be docked for that time.

The PBA seeks fo enhance the benefits under this provision by amending

Article 34 as follows:

39
The County's on the job injury policy as it affects
Officers represented by PBA Local 258 shall provide that when
an injury occurs an the jab, the attected Officers shall be

The County opposes the PBA's proposal. The County seeks to eliminate
longuage that no longer applies and codify the current benefit through two (2)
modificotions: (1) in the first sentence of the first paragraph, reploce “up to one
(1) year at full pay” with “up to sixty (60) calendar days at full pay", and (2)
delete the first sentence in the second paragraph. The County olso seeks to
include an oddifional limitation on the current provision by proposing to delete

the following from the third paragraph — "on an unresticted/full-duty basis”.

Having reviewed the parties! proposals in conjunction the awarded items
as a whole and the evidence presented in this maiter, the policy in Article 34
does not require modification other than codifying the curent benefit as
proposed by the County. | award the County's proposal to {1} in the first
sentence of the first paragroph, replace “up to one (1) year at full pay” with "up
to sixty [60) calendar days at full pay”, and (2) delete the first sentence in the

second paragraph.

Other Modifications/Proposals on Economic Issues not Awarded

As to the remainder of the porties' modifications and proposals on the
economic issues, including but not limited to the PBA's proposo's on automatic
step movement upon the contract expiration date, reductions to the Tier 4

contribution rates, and uniform allowance, all of which are benefits that do not

a
exist for any other County bargaining uni, and the County's proposals ta modify
Articles 9IE) and 9(F), | thoroughly reviewed ond considered their respective
positions. Having examined these items in conjunction with ihe supporting
evidentiary submissions | do not find sufficient justification to award them in
whole of in part at this time. | find that the improved economic changes that |
have awarded are reasonable and inclusive of what the financial impact of ihe
award should be while also faking inio consideration that the County's overall
iinoncial obligations include having to fund the economic terms of all of its 21
bargaining units. The remaining modifications and proposals on the economic

issues are therefore rejected.

NON-ECONOMIC ISSUES

Vacation Leave - Article 14

Atficle 14 establishes vacation day entitlement based upon a requisite

number of years of service. The last sentence af Article 14 provides:

Bidding for vacations shall be based upon Civil Service
seniority, provided it does not create a shortage of
experienced Officers on a given shift.

The PBA proposes to eliminaie the sentence above and replace it with

the following:

42
Vacation time requests shall be awarded based upon
Departmental Seniarity. Vacation time off requests shall be
made within the first thirty (30) days of each calendar year
after the rebid shift change occurs and the new seniarity
schedules are implemented, and approval and/or denial of
all requests shall be made within fifteen (15] days thereafter.
Affer completion of the initial thirty (30) day request period,
any requests for days off will be on a firs} come first serve
basis.

The County is amenable to including a modified version of the language
above as long as [1] the superior officers have 30 days fo respond to the
vacation requests and (2) the sentence that the PBA seeks to eliminate remains
in place. The County submits that the elimination of the relevant sentence

“could endanger every working C.O. on a particular shift, and of course the

inmates." [County Brief, p. 58]

The evidence shows that a memorialization of the use af seniority for the
purposes of requesting vacation would mutually benefit the parties, but it does
nat establish thot the sentence that the PBA seeks ta eliminate is necessary or
best serves the public's interest. | award the follawing language to be added to

Article 14:

Vacation time requests shall be awarded based upon
Departmental Seniority. Vacation time off requests shall be
made within the first thirty [30] days of each calendar year
after the rebid shift change occurs and the new seniarity
schedules are implemented. and approval and/ar denial of
all requests shall be made within thirty {30] days thereafter.
After campletion of the initial thirty [30) day request period,

8B
any requests for days off will be on a first come fist serve
basis,

Seniority - Article 27

Article 27 ~ Seniority provides:

A. Seniority shail be defined as an employee's
length of unbroken continuous service with the Department
of Corrections. Seniority shall commence and begin to
accumulate from the employee's first day of appointment by
Ocean County as a duly sworn Correction Officer as
recegnized by Civil Service standards and occordingly by
any break in service.

8. The seniority system shall be administered
deportmentally. An employee will carry his/her seniority from
oné section, division ar unit of the department fo another.
Employees will not lose seniority rights if transfered from one
title ar duly assignment to another within the same rank.

C. The Warden shall hove the authority to designote
employees fo a sixty (60} day troining petiod when filling a
new position within the Deportment of Carrections.

D. The Warden sholl, regardiess of accumulated
seniority of employee (s) in question, have the authority to
make emergency transfers to positions where needed for a
period not to exceed ninety {90} days

ca Officers shall have the sight to bid for their shift as
well as days off, when transferred into the division. The
Warden shall retain the sole autharity for the assignment of
Officers to sections, divisions or units within the Deporiment.

44
The PBA proposes to create new Sections B and C and to te-designate

the existing sections. The PBA's proposals provide:

B. The County shall implement and maintain a shift selection
and days off annual bidding process with the following
provisions being followed:

1. The employer shall post a seniority list by October 15 of the
preceding year.

2. Seniority bidding shall commence November |.

3. The new schedule shall be posted by November 7" based
upon the bids that have been awarded.

4, The new schedule, which is the result of the seniority
bidding process, shall be effective the first full week of
January.

5. The employer shall have the right to deviate from the
procedure in special needs circumstances, including but
not limited to ensuring appropriate staffing levels and
ensuring that at least one female officer is working each
shift.

4. The parties agree that there is one seniority list regardless
of gender.

7. No individual shall be denied their seniority selection due
to discrimination.

C. Upon the completian of the annual bidding process each
Officer assigned ta the Security Unit, on their respective shift,
will have the right to bid for their working post{s] for each of
their five (5) working days. The bidding of posts will be done in
accordance with Deparimental Seniority on said shifts.

1, Center Contral- Officers assigned to Center Control will be

at the discretion of the Officer in Charge. No Officer will be
assigned to work in Center Control against his/her will.

45
Center Control will be filed prior to the post bidding
process begins.

2. Officers with more than one (1) year as a sworn Officer of
the Deporiment will not be moved trom their [bidded]
post, unless an emergency arises as deemed by the
Officer in Charge. Officers with one (i} year or less, as a
swom Officer with the Department, may be subject to post
reassignment on a daily basis by the Officer in Charge.

3. On or befare June 1 of each yeor. Officers assigned to the
Security Unit may re-bid their post assignment(s) in
accardance with above mentioned process. Officers will
then switch to new post assignment{s} on or before July 1
of that year.

The PBA's brief includes ratianale for this proposal:

Finally, one of the most imporlant praposals put farih by
P.B.A. #258 seeks to modify Article 27 entitled “Seniority,” To
this end, P.B.A, #258's proposal seeks to codify the shift and
past bidding process that have been adhered ta by the
parties for the past several years. For the Arbitratar's
reference, shift bidding pertains fo the shift a member works,
such as 7:00 a.m. to 3:00 p.m., whereas post bidding refers ta
the specific assignment a member works dusing his/her shift,
such as being assigned io a fower or a certain detention
area

By way of background, in 2014, the then-Warden af the
Ocean County Department of Corrections, Theodore Hutler,
executed an agreement with P.8.A. #258 referred to as the
“Three Year Rule.” (Exhibit PBA-1-27). The agreement expressly
provided far shift and post bidding for P.B.A. #258 members
and was effective for the 2015 and 2016 calendar years.
(1T65:3-6}. The first section of the agreement outlined the units
and/or assignments the Warden retained the unfettered right
fo assign members ia, irrespective of the posi bidding
process. {1163:22-64: Nevertheless, these units and/or
assignments were subject fo the shitt bidding process, thereby

 

46
allowing P.B.A. #258 members fo bid upon the specific shift
they would work. Ibid.

The second section of the “Three Year Rule" provided
post bidding rights for those members assigned to the Security
Division (Exhibit PBA-1-27; 1164:2-11]. For clarity, the Security
Division contains muttiple posts, ta include thase directly
supervising inmales, relief ossignments, and roving patrol
assignments. Ibid. To this end, this section of the agreement
allowed P.B.A. #258 members to bid upon their respective
posts and/or assignments based upon seniarity, (1764:8-11}.

As explained by President Woods, the agreement was
entitled the “Three Year Rule" because any member who
possessed less than three (3) years with the Ocean County
Department of Carrections was nat eligible to engage in the
post bidding process:

Q. And this particular agreement, Luke, was calied the
Three-Year Rule and | think the warden labeled that
because it lasted for three years; is that correct?

A. No, that was filled because of any officer that
didn't have...three yeors within the department
wouldn't have the fight to bid for the post inside the
security unit, although the afficers in charge allowed
them to bid. They also—they understood that they were
subject to being replaced or being moved ta a
different post at will and anyone that had three years
or more within a department would be placed—would
choose their post and not be able to be moved from
their post.

(1164:12-65:2.]

Upon expiratian of the “Three Year Rule” Agreement, a
subsequent agreement was reached between P.B.A. #258
and now-Warden Mueller. (1165:7-10). This agreement was
colloquially refered to as “The Five-Year Rule” Agreement.
(Exhibit PBA-1-28; 1766:7-9). This subsequent agreement. in
essence, continued the shift and past bidding processes and
benefits contained in the “Three Year Rule" Agreement for
2016 through the expiration of the instant collective
negotiations agreement. (1165:16-66:2). However, the name

47
of the agreement was changed ta ihe "Five Year Rute”
because the P.B.A. #258 membership was geiting a bit older
and, thus, the post bidding process would only be available
to these members who possessed five (5) years with fhe
Department, as opposed to three {3} years in the prior
agreement. (1166:7-14).

The “Five Year Rule" Agreement also slightly modified
the units and/or assignments the Warden retained discretion.
ever and the units and/or assignments that were subject to
the post bidding pracess, (1166:15-25). Nevertheless, the “Five
Year Rule” Agreement continued the bidding pracess for oll
open assignments. Ibid. The Agreement also allowed a “re-
bid" halfway through the year so as fo allow members to
chonge posis and/or assignments, if they so desired. Ibid,
Outside of these minor modifications, everything ‘ram the
"Three Year Rule" Agreement remained the same. This was
concisely explained by President Woods:

This agreement which we came ta as we called it the—
we ended up changing it to the Five-Year Rule and the
reasan we chonged it to five yeors is the department
was getting a little bil older and we didn’ t—so anyone
with less than five years would be subject to removal
tom their post that they bid for within security and
anyone with more than five years would not.

With that we also changed—came to an agreement
on what units the warden cauid place officers in based
upon deporimental seniority. We continued the re-
bidding of any apen assignment posts. We allowed ta
do a past re-bid halfway through the year, so if officers
wanted ta and could, you know based upon their
seniorily, they could change their posi halfway through
the year. Thot was basically it. Like | said, everything
else was the same,

(1166:7-25.]

The shift anc post bidding pravided in the “Five Year
Rule” Agreement was continued through the expiration of the
collective negotiations agreement on June 30, 2019.
Accarding to Presiden’ Woods, the Agreement is being
followed at the current time. (\167:13-68:3]. To this end, each

48
and every Component of the Agreement is being followed
with the exception of post bidding. Ibid. However, Warden
Mueller has deferred to the respective Oificers in Chorge of
each shift as to whether to offer posi bidding. Ibid. Of the
three (3) shifts available, two (2) of the Officers in Charge
have allowed the post bidding to continue. Ibid, The final
Officer in Charge has not put the respective posts for bidding,
but the post ossignments that were awarded based upon the
lasi bidding process have remained in place. Ibid, in other
words, there has not yet been a need to put the assignments
up for bidding os of yet

 

In its proposal, P.B.A. #258 seeks fo codify the ''Five Year
Rute” into the collective negotiations agreement, thereby
preserving the shit and post bidding processes that have
been followed for the past five (5} years. (1168:8-12).
Moreover, the proposol seeks to institute certain deadlines os
to when the respective bidding processes will commence
and when the shifts and/or posts will be awarded.

While recognizing the Warden and, by extension, the
Caunty retains great discretion as to assigning certain
individuals to certain pasts and/or assignments, the shift and
posi bidding processes are of vital importance to the P.B.A.
#258 membership. Specifically, these bidding processes
promote stability in members’ personal lives as well as boost
their morale in getting io work a shift, post, ar assignment
which they dese, This was detailed by Presiden! Waads
during the caurse of his direct testimony:

Q. How impartant, Luke, is il 10 your members fo have
the ability to bid for their shifts, their days off, as well as
their pasts?

A. [mean the shifts and days off. { mean that's just—
that's obvious you know. You want to get the best shift
and the best days off that work for you and your
tamily...it jus} boasts morale for the post bidding within
the department.

You're stuck within the confines of the jail. It's nice to

be able to wark whether it’s the same pest every day
or the same past with the same partner every day or

49
just the post that you want to be working at as
opposed fo being fold that you hove to work there.

[1168:13-69:63

President Woods olso detoiled the importance of the
continuity that shift and post bidding provides in maintaining
the security of the correctionol tacility:

Q. And as far as the octual security in running the jail,
‘Luke, with continuity of individuals working at the some
post is that important as well?

A. Absolutely. The biggest thing with—goes bock to
dealing with inmates. Inmates are on a schedule within
the facility and that schedule works because the
inmates know what to do, when to do if, eat when to
eof, sleep when to sleep, so it works for them. And in
turn, if goes some fer the officers because we're in
there just os much as they ore, so to allow us fo have
that continuity of being in the same spot or the same—
on the same post or doing the same job with the same
people every day, i} makes your day go better and |
think it gets you a better officer out of it. And that all
came about when the new jail was designed.

Warden Hutler had come up with a policy that officers
hod to work the same post five days a week and then
that was done by seniority, not as an agreemeni, buf
that's what he wanted because ne wanted the
continuity of the same officer being in the same unit
because il's the same inmates day in and day out and
so the unit should run the same if it's the same officer
day in and day out which means you'll have tess
problems.

(1T69:7-70:7.]

Lastly, President Woods explained how the shift and
post bidding processes ensure that officers get to know the
inmates they are responsible for in their particular unit and/or
assignment, thereby furthering security and stability in the
facility as well:

50
@. And os far as the officers having the ability to
actually know the inmates that are housed within their
unit with the post that they work, how important is that
fo safety ond security as well?

A. I's very important because if you work with the
same inmate every day you may knew an inmate, just
their attitude. Knowing who the inmate is and how to
deal with the inmate because you work there day in
and day out makes it, one, makes it easier to work in
the unit, but two, makes if sofer becouse one inmete
moy work @ uni! five days a week and know that
inmate so-and-so tends to get heated over a game of
cards. And | understand that if's not an argument; it's
just how he expresses himself. But if it's someone
different every day, that person may not understand
that and see thot inmate get heated and passibly think
that there's s¢rmething starting to happen. Then the
officer could passibly get involved which then could
lead into a bunch of different scenarios.

So if you have the same person there, you know, ond
lypically when we bid for our posts the mast senior guys
are bidding the same post five days a week.
Sometimes it's three days here, two days there as a
break, but being thal it's done by seniorily, they
typically choose the same spot every day so they have
that continuity.

(11708-71:9.]

in opposition to the proposal, the County elicited
testimony from Warden Mueller and Deputy Warden Valenti
indicating that the Deporiment and, more specifically,
Officers in Charge must maintain discretion to assign officers
to posts they deem appropriate given each officer's unique
set of skills, strengths, and/or weakness. {17)53:13-154:19; 202:
Moreover, the County seems to argue that this discretion must
be maintained in light of the changes to the correctional
facility on account of bail reform, normely the decrease in the
inmate population. Thus, according to the County, the
Department must be provided the abilify to assign officers to
different posts when certain pasts needs jo be closed and/or
catlapsed on account of the population fluctuation.

51
The County's arguments in opposition to the proposal
are somewhat hollow. First, i is undisputed that the County
and/or Department have been abiding by either the “Three-
Year Rule” or “Five-Year Rule” Agreements for the past five (5)
years. Thus, any assertion that the implementation of shift and
post bidding processes contained in the agreements have a
detrimental impacl upon the safety and security of the
correctional facility are without meri. Simply put, if the shift
and post bidding selection processes had an adverse impoct
on safely ana/or security, the “Three-Year Rule” Agreement
would not have been, in essence, renewed throvgh
implementation of the “Five-Yeor Rule” Agreement. Further,
os detailed by President Woods, utilizofion of the shift and
post bidding processes actually enhonced sofely and
security at the facility, nol compromised it.

Additionally, cognizant of the Departmeni’s need to
close certoin posts and/or assignments on occasion,
President Woods testified thot the reassignment of mernbers
in such circumstances hos been accepted by P.B.A. #258
and, thus, would not constitute a violation of this language if
the proposal is ulfimately awarded:

@. And if thay [P.B.A. #258 members] have bid on a
parlicular post and the County is moving them
someplace else, in effect fhe County would be in
violation of the contract, wouldn't they?

A. No, there's an understanding thot if o post closed—
we've already had this incident, that if a post closed
the officer understands that he's not gaing to be in that
post, or by selecting a posi there may be the—
because of projects going on within the jail that he
may be reassigned to a different post or as an extra
because his post is now vacant.

[1T113:9-20,]
Warden Mueller confirmed this understanding during
her crass-examination and expressly indicated that the shift

and post bidding processes being utilized, subject to
reassignments being necessitated due to the closure of

52
ceriain posts, have not resulted in any issues in running the
focility:

Q. And you were here when Officer Woods testified,
correct?

A. Yes.

@. And Officer Woods, you heard him state that the
PBA had no issues with officers being moved during—
due to the fact that pasts were being closed, correct?

A. Correct...

Q. And you testified that you have two OICs [Officers
in Charge] that are still currently following the Five-Year
Rule?

A. They're allowing people fo bid for their post. but
then they have the authority as OIC to move people
around as they see fit regardless of where the person
bid.

Q. And given that they‘re stil implementing and
following the Five-Year Rule since | guess you believe it
expired at the end of June, | take it there haven't been
any Issues with it thus fare

A. There haven't} been any issues because when
officers needs to be deployed or redeployed it can
happen.

[17158:8-1 60:4.)

Lastly, the County seems to lake the position thot P.B.A.
$#258's proposal in its curent form seems fo allow P.B.A. #258
members to bid on their posts and/or assignment each and
every day. (1T202:3-8]. This is not the intention of the proposal.
Instead, the proposal allows members to bid for the post
and/or assignment they would work five (5] days a week, not
allow a bid for each post each and every day. Such an
approach would be nonsensical and does nat accurately
teflect what is being sought by P.B.A. #258 as referenced in
President Woods' testimony.

§&3
After reviewing the reasoning behind the proposal and
acknowledging the fact that shift and post bidding has been
utilized by the Department for the post five (5} years. P.B.A.
#258's proposal must be owarded. Quite simply, codification
of the shifi and post bidding processes is necessitated to
ensure this benefit is preserved for P.8.A. #258 rmembers going
forward. Additionally, the award of this proposal furthers
continuity ir: the operation of the correctional facility, thereby
fostering safety and security for not only CBA. #258 members,
but inmates and civilian personnel as well. [PBA Brief, pp. 104-
21.

The County is not opposed io the inclusion of portions of the PBA's
proposal as it applies to shift bidding and time aff, but if rejects the remainder of
the PBA's proposal far operational reasons and contends that it infringes upon

the County's managerial rights:

‘The PBA has proposed to revamp the seniorily article of
the CBA. The County agrees that seniority as it applies to shift
bidding and time off should control, and in fact, it does.
Moreover, the procedural aspects of seniority also are
appropriate for Inclusion in o CBA. {Section 8 {1]. (2), 3} and
(4}). However, the County strongly disagrees that seniority
should control with regard to assignments. Section 8 (5) and
C {i}, (2) and (3} do exactly that.

The Department has been very fair about assignments.
First, Warden Hutter entered inio the "3-Year Rule" with the PBA
regarding assignments. Second, Warden Mueller entered into
the “5-Year Rule" with the PBA. Both the "3-Year Rule” and the
"6-Yeor Rule" [sunsetted] on tne last day of the agreements.
Warden Mueller did not review the "5-Year Rule” because of
the dramatic change in the operations of the correction
facilifies due to the Boll Reform Act.

On cross-examination, C.O. Woods admitted that there
has been o dramatic change in operations because of Bail

54
Reform. Woods conceded that dye to the decline in inmate
population, posts are frequently closed and the assigned
C.O.'s have to bé re-assigned. (Ir. 104:6 - 107:1).

Warden Mueller explained that the bidding an
assignments provided by the "S-Year Rule” no longer warked
because Bail Reform has caused so many changes in a short
span of time. At one point. six (4) Units i the jail were closed
{Tr. 140: 6-19}. Mueller explained that re-assignments had to
be made based upon the skills needed for the assignment.
The Warden relies on the judgement of the OIC [Officer ia
Charge) fo make the appropriate reassignment. Moreover,
she explained the assignments can be very different even
though they are allin the same facility. (Tr. 140:15 - 143:24).

Since of the "S-Year Rule” has expired, two {2} out of the
three (3) OIC’s have coniinued to allow their C.O's to bid
their posts with the undersionding that if the post is closed.
the officer will be reassigned. (Tr. 143:22 - 14:12). Mueller
stated that the elimination of the "S-Year Rule” has not hed a
negative impact. (Tr. 144:13-16). At the conclusion of her
testimony, Warden Mueller emphasized the importance of
having the flexibility and discretion io reassign C.0.’s to those
posts where they were the"... right kind of officer or the right
kind of skilis and abilities ... everybody is just nat acrass the
board the same kind of personality when if comes to dealing
with inmates." (Tr. 145: 5-20}.

Deputy Warden Valenti corroborated = Muetler’s
testimony and even went info greater detail regarding the
difference in the assignments (Ir. 179 - 184:13). Valenti
explained the difference between shift bidding and bidding
on posts, or in other words, assignments {Tr. 206:20 - 210:11}
The Deputy Warden specifically said he supports shift bidding.
(Tr. 210:12-14]. However, he opposed past bidding. When
asked on cross if fhere were any issues with post bidding,
Volenti gave specific exampies of C.O.'s balking at
reassignments different than their bidded past. (Tr. 208: 23 -
210:13}.

Officer Waods insinuated in his testimany that if the PBA
Seniority Proposal was awarded and C.©.'s had fo be
reassigned, the PBA would not have a problem with the PBA.
(Tr. 107:3-15). Unfortunately, doing thai would be in vialatian

55.
of Proposal Number 2, Seniosity and the County would likely
be in grievance arbitration. There is a reason why the County
has proposed “looser pays” in the County's grievance
arbitration proposal.

Finally, and probably most importantly, the law does
not support the PBA’s proposal. The Public Employment
Commission has ruled for years that ihe employer has a non-
negotiable prerogative to assign employees to meet the
governmental policy goal of matching the best qualified
employees to particular jobs. New Jersey Transit Comp. v. PBA
Lacal_304, 32 NIPER 142, 2006 West Law 6824445 (Oct. 26,
2006}/{PERC restrained arbitration, holding that “arbitrator may

officers were best suited for undercover assignments.”};

restrained arbitration relating to Sheriff's refusal to consider a

holding that permiifing him to fill this position would

rank and experience can better be used."}, Surlington

249, 28 NJPER 33064, 2002 Wesl Law 34677508 {Mar. 28,

3194650 (May 26, 2016)["[I]he emplayer s selection of the
purportedly best-qualified candidate for the mail roam officer
post [in corrections facility! wos noi subject to binding

representatives may agree ihat seniority can be a factor in
shift selection where all qualifications are equal, managerial
prerogatives are not otherwise compromised. and the
employer retains the right to deviate from the procedures
where necessary 1o accomplish a governmental policy goal.
Caunty of Hudson_y. PBA Local 109A, 42 NJPER 32, 2015 West
Law 5604425 (Aug. 13, 2015] {finding that clause in Agreement
“was nof mandatorily negotiable because it appears to
mandate that shift assignments be based solely on seniority
and does not appear lo preserve management’ s right to

 

 

56
deviate from a seniority shift assignment system to accomplish
iis govemmental policy goals.”).

In conclusion, besides the law being very clear
regarding this proposal, ihe PBA has noi demonstrated a
need for it. C.O. Woods and Warden Mueller both testified
that the County has prudently exercised its discretion
regarding assignments, Therefore, given the dramatic

changes in operations due to the Bail Reform Act, this
proposal should be rejected. [County Brief, pp. 58-61].

Having considered the parties’ arguments in conjunction with ihe
evidence presented in support of their respective positions, | award the PBAs
proposals to create and include new Section B{1]-(4), but | conclude that the
PBA has met its burden to prove that the remainder of the proposal requires

implementation at this time.

Agency Shop Provision - Article 28

The current Agreement includes an agency shop provisian. The County's
proposes to eliminate this provision, The PBA did nol expressly address the merits
of the County's proposal in iis post-hearing brief. Agency shop fees are now
illegal pursuant Janus v. AFSMCE, Council 31, ef al. 585 US. (2028). Put
simply, the provision is inconsistent with prevailing law. | award the elimination of

this provision while adding new language in its place as follows:

o7
The parties recagnize and shall be guided by the terms of the
Workplace Democracy Enhancement Act as set forth in
NSA. 34:13A-5.11,

Other Modifications/Proposals on Non-Economic issues not Awarded

As to the remainder of the parties’ modifications and proposals on the
non-economic issues, including but not limited to the PBA's proposal on
emplayee rights which seeks the incorporation of select areas of prevailing law,
and the County's proposals with respect to Article 6 - Uniform Maintenance
Allowance and Article 21 - Grievance Procedure, | thoroughly reviewed and
considered their respective positions. Having examined these items in
conjunction with the supporting evidentiary submissions 1 do not find sufficient

justification to award them in whole or in part and, therefore, are rejected.

CONCLUSION

1 conclude that the terms of this Award represent a reasonable
determination of the issues after applying the statutory criteria. i have weighed
tne statutory factors as more fully discussed above and conclude there is
nothing in the record thai compels a different result han | have determined in

this proceeding.
