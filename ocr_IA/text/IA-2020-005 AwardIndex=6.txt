BACKGROUND

The County describes itself os "Ihe secand largest county in the staie
containing 638 square miles of pine barrens and barrier islands and a 45-mile
coostiine along the Allantic Ocean." The Counly's census population in 2010
was 576,567, As of July 1, 2018, ihe County's population was estimated to be

601,651.

The County hos 21 borgaining units, seven (7) of which are law
enforcement unils. P8A Local No. 258 represents the County's Carrection
Officers, excluding Sergeants, Lieutenants and Captains. Tke duratian of the

parties’ most recent Agreement is from April 1, 2016 through June 30, 2019.

As of June 30, 2019, there were 174 bargaining unit members in Local 258.
Accarding fa PBA Local Union President iucion Woods. there are currentty 171

borgaining unit members in the unit. [1:16].

The parties presented a vast amaunt of evidence during the praceedings.
They also supmitted detailed, comprehensive briefs and certifications fo support
iheir respective positions and to rebut those of the opposing party. The parties
urge the acceptance of their respective proposals. As the arbitrator noted in W

Windsor Tp & PBA Local 271, 1A-2009-014 (Mastriani 2019), the strict and timiled

18
time constraints under the law do nol permit the arbitrator 70 provide an

exhaustive summary of the evidence presented, However, these submissions

have been thoroughly reviewed and considered in rendering a final Award on

the parties" proposals.

DISCUSSION

Lam required lo make a reasonable determination of the issues, giving

due weight to the statutory criteria set forih in N.JS.A. 34:13A-16(g}. The

 

statutory criteria are as follows:

(1)

(2)

The interests and welfare of the public. Among the items the
arbitrator or panel of arbitrators shall cssess when considering
this factor are the limitations imposed upon the ernployer by
(P.L. 1976, c. 68 (C. 40A:4-45.1 ef seq.)

Comparison of the wages, salaries, hours, and conditions of
employment of the employees involved in the arbitration
proceedings with the wages, hours, and conditions af
employment of other employees performing the same or
similar services and with other employees generally:

ia} In private emplayment in general provided,
however, each parly shail have the right fo
submil additional evidence for ihe arbitrator's
consideration,

{b) In. public employment in general; provided,
however, each party shall have the right to
supmil additional evidence for the arbitrator's
consideration

19
(3)

(4)

{5}

(6)

(7)

 

In public employment in the same or similar
comparable jurisdictions, as determined in
accordance with section 5 of PL. 1995. C. 425
(C.34:13A-16.2) provided, however, each parly
shall have the right to submit additional evidence
concerning the comparabllty of jurisdictions for
the arbitrator's consideration.

The overall compensation presently received by the
employees, inclusive of direct wages, salary, vacations,
holidays, excused leaves, insurance and pensions, medical
and hespitalizotion benefits, and all olner economic benefils
received.

Stipulations of the parlies.

The lawful authority of the employer. Among the items the
arbitrator or pane! of arbitretors shall assess when considering
this factor are the limitations imposed upon the employer by
the P.L. 1976 c. 68 (C.40A:4-45 ef seq,].

The financial impact en the governing unit, ils residents and
taxpayers. When considering this factor ina dispute in which
tne public empioyer is a county or a municipality, the
orbitrator or panel of arbitrators shall take into account to the
extent that evidence is introduced, how the award will affect
the municipal or county purposes element, as the case may
be, of the locat property tax: a comparison of the
perceniage of the municipol purposes element, or in the
case of a county, the county purposes element, required to
fund the employees’ contract in the preceding local budget
year with that required under the award for Ihe current local
budget year; the impact of the award for each income
sector of the property taxpayers on the local unit; the impact
of the award on ihe abilily of the governing body {o (a)
mainidin existing loca! progroms and services, [b} expand
existing local programs ond services for which public meneys
have been designated by the governing body in a proposed
local budget, or (c} initiate any new programs and services
for which public moneys have been designated by the
governing body in its proposed local budget.

The cost of living.

20
{8} The continuity and stability of employment incluaing seniority
fights and such other factors not confined to the foregoing
which are ordinarily or traditionally considered in the
determination of wages, hours and conditions of employment
through collective negotiations and collective bargaining
between jhe parties in the public service and in private
employment.

{9} Statutory restrictions imposed on the employer. Among the
items the arbitrator or panel of arbitrators shail assess when
considering this factor are the limitations imposed upon the
employer by section 10 of P.L. 2007, c. 62 (C.-40A:4-45.45).

All of the statutory factors are relevant, but they are not necessarily
eniiled to equal weight. | am required to make a reasonable determination of
the issues with a reasoned explanation for the award. | must also indicate which
slatutory factors are deemed relevant, the due weight that was given to each
factor, and which factors, if any, are deemed to be irrelevant, The criteria also
provide me with the authority to consider other such factors not confined to
those specifically stated which are ordinarily or jraditionally considered in the
determination of wages, hours and conditions of employment. [N.J.S.A. 34:13A-
16{g){8)]._ In this case, | conclude that the interests and welfare of the public,
the public sector comparisons (intemal and external), and the financial impact
on the governing unit, is residents, and taxpayers must be given greater weight
than such other factors as the cost of living and private sector comparisons. |
have also given due weight to the faci that this Award will not require the
County to exceed its lawful authority or any statutory restrictions. The party
seeking a change i an existing term or condition of employment bears the

at
burden of justifying the proposed change, { have considered my decision to
award or deny any individual issue in dispute as part of the overall terms that |
have awarded, along with the continuation of contract terms and benefits thai

are not in dispute.

Interests and Welfare of the Public

interest Arbitrators in New Jersey have widely recognized that “tlhe
interests and welfare of the public [N.J.S.A. NuJ.S.A. 34:13A+16g11)] is paramount
because it is a criterion that embraces many of the ather factors and recognizes
their relationships.” Washington Tp & PBA Local 307, |A-2009-053 {Mastriani 2012);
see irvingion Tp & Irvington Police Superior Olficers Association, (A-2019-010
{Osborn 2019}; W Windsor Tp & PBA Local 271, 1A-2009-014 (Mastriani 2019):
Boonton & PBA Local 212, 1A-2019-021 (Kronick 2019}. I now reviow the interests

and welfare criterion through the other statutory factors addressed below.

Lawful Authority of the Employer/Financial Impact on the Governing Unit, Its
Residents and Toxpayers/Statutory Restrictions Imposed on the Empioyer
NSA. 34:12A-16g{1], (5). (6) and {9} refer to the (awful authority of the
employer, the financial impact of the award, and fhe statutory restrictions
imposed on the employer. The PBA contends that the County “has nol

presented sufficient, substantial, and/or concrete evidence to establish an

22
inobility io pay P.8.A #258 members the wage increases and other economic
incentives thai have been requested." [PBA Brief, p. 122]. It is true thot the
County does not claim an inabilliy to pay up to ihe statutory permitted levels,
but it submits that the PBA’s Final Offer “is clearly an excessive demand that will
hove a substantial negative impact on the County both in the short term and in
the future; especially since if will have a huge impact on negotiations with the
County's other 20 unions." [County Brief, p. 92]. | conclude thal the evidentiary
racord developed during this proceeding does not require the awarding of
either party's proposals in their entirety. This Award will not have an adverse
impact upon the County, its taxpayers and residents, and il will nol prohibit the
County from meeting its statutory obligations or cause it to exceed ils jawful
authority. Further, this Aword serves the interests and welfare of the public

through a thorough weighing of ail of the statutory crileria.

Comparability

Private Employment

Given the unique nature of public safety positions, the comparison to
private employment has not been allotted significant weight in previous interest
orbifration awords. There continues fo be an absence of evidence to support a

deviation fram giving greater weight to public sector comparisans.

23
Public Employment in General/in the Same or Similar Jurisdictions

With respect to public employment, the PBA presented comparisons of
this bargaining unit included, but were not fimited io (1) low enforcement
officers within the municipal police departments in Ocean County, (2)
Corrections Officers in counly facilities statewide, and (3) the County's civilian
bargaining units. The Counly presented o general comparison of this
bargaining unif to public and private empioyment. The County contends that
the internal comparability of its 21 bargaining units, including the likelihood that
this award would give substantial weight fo the internal comporabilily factor
and/or a pattern of settlement for 2019 and 2020, must be given greater weight
than fhe PBA's Comparison with other municipal police officers in Ocean
County. | note that the collective negotiations agreements between the
County and its six {6) other law enforcement units (Corrections Superiors - PBA
Local 258A, Sheriff's Officers — PBA Local 379, Sheriff's Superiors — PBA Local 379A,
Prosecutor's Detectives and investigators — PBA Local 171, Prosecutor's
Sergeants’ Association, and Prosecutor's Supetior Officers Association) all have
an expiration date of June 38, 2019 and, as of the date of the interes? arbitration

hearing, had not reached terms for successor contracts.

PERC's website includes the most recent salary increase analysis for

interest arbitration awards for calendar years 2012 through 2017. The average

24
increase for post-2011 2% cases was 1.71% for calendar year 2015, 1.94% for
2016, and 2.05% for 2017. The average increase for non-interest arbitration
settlements in 2016 was 3.16% and 3.53% in 2017. | considered this information in
rendering the Award, but | emphasize that the 2% base salary "Hard Cap" has
sunset and, therefore. the awards and setllemenis that were seni under the cap

are not dispositive as to the outcome of this matter.

PERC's website also includes four (4) interes} arbitration awards that have
been issued for post-2% base salary “Hard Cap” impasses: Hopewell Tp & PBA
Loc 342, |A-2019-016 (Osborn 2019} appealed buf affirmed by Commission
P.ER.C. No. 2020-11 (8/15/19), Bedminster Tp & PBA Loc 366, IA-2019-017 (Kronick
2019] appealed but affirmed by Commission P.E,R.C. No. 2020-10 (8/15/19}, W
Windsor Tp & PBA Local 271, IA-2009-014 (Mastriani 2019}, and Boonton & PBA
Loc 212, 1A-2019-021 (Kronick}. Each award pertained to a law enforcement
unil in a municipality. In each instance, the collective negotiations organization
proposed fo reduce the Tier 4 levels that borgaining unit members were
requited ta contribute towards health benefits. in each instance, the orbitrator
did not award the propasa!l. As to base salary, the arbitrator in Hopewell froze
the starting salary for 2019 through 2021, increased all other steps Gn the 2019
guide by 2.2%, increased the top step by 2%, added one [1] step, and froze all
other steps in 2020, and for 2021 increased all steps (except starting salary) by

1.8%. Sleo advancement was provided in eoch year of the contract In

25
Bedminster, the orbitrator froze the solary guide for 2019 except the tap siep
which was increased by 2%. The arbitrator hen awarded across-the-board
increases of 2% in 2019, 2% in 2020, and 2% in 2021. Step advancement was
provided in each year of the contract. In W Windsor, the arbitrator awarded
across-the-board increases of 2% in 2019, across-ihe-board increases of 2% in
2020, across-the-board increases 2.25% in 2021, and across-the-board increases
of 2.25% in 2022. Slep advancement was provided in each year of the
contract. Lastly, in Boonton, the arbitrator awarded across-the-board increases
of 2.25% plus a $1,000 adjustment at the top step in 2019, across-the-board
increases of 2.25% plus a $1,000 adjustment at the top step in 2020, and across-
the-board increases 2.25% plus a $1,000 adjusiment at the top step in 2021. Step
advancement was provided in each year of the contract. in each award, the
orbitrater reviewed the evidence cansidered fo be the most unique and

relevant in each of the Municipalities.

| also reviewed the parlies’ internal comparisons. The PBA emphasized
that “the County's civilian bargaining units were not subjected to the restrictions
of the Iwo percent (2%) solary cap os their members do nat serve as law
enforcement officers and, thus, cannol avali themselves of the interest
arbitration process. As such, as compared to their law enforcement
counterparts, many Counly civilian bargaining unit employees were able fe

secure somewhal generous percentage increases to their salaries for ihe several

26
years during the twa percent (2%) salary cap's existence and applicability.”
[PBA Brief, p. 69]. Moreover, “during thal some period of time the salary guide
for P.B.A. #258 members was dramatically expanded and the maximum salary
afforded fo members remained stagnant.” [Id], The PBA stressed Inot “pattern
of setilement™ does nol exist al this time and cannot control the outcome of this
matter. The County emphasized other factors. For instance, the County
indicated that of its “approximately 1.850 fulltime employees and a few
hundred port-time employees” that “65 out of the top 300 paid County
employees are Corrections Officers." [ld. at 79; see Ex. C-1-103], Moreover, “all
settlemenis for Ocean County CBAs expiring in 2020 and 2021 provide for a 1.9%
or flat dollar increase for 2019 and 2020. [See Ex. C-1-100]. The County also
emphasized thot all other County ernployees continue to contribute at Tier 4
levels for their health benefits. All of the infernal and external comparisons were

considered and weighed along with all of ihe other stolutory factors.

As to corrections officers in other counties in New Jersey, the PBA indicates
that the bargaining unit fils within the “middle of the pack” of Ihe comparisan
group that il views as “the most appropriate comparison” for ils sclary proposal.
[PBA Brief, 0. 45]. The PBA presented comparison charls. [id at 65-47]. Based
upon the BA's charts, which include comparative data for Bergen, Monmouth,
Middlesex, Mortis, Passaic and Hudson, top salaries on salary guides range from

$91,278 {Camden} to $126,642 [Bergen], with Local 258’s al $93,748 (Step 15}

27
land off-guide of $96,581). Based upen Ihe PBA's charts, which include
comporative data far Mortis, Bergen, Gloucester, Essex and Camden, slarting
salaries range from Lacal 258's at $40,000 to $47,352 (Maris). Based upon the
PBA's charls, which include comparative data for Essex, Mercer, Bergen,
Middlesex, Possaic, Warren, Union, Hudsan, Salem, Atianlic, Sussex, Carnden,
Gloucester. Somerset, Monmouth, Moris, Cumberland, Hunterdon and
Burlington, sieps on the salary guides renged from six (6) {Essex} fo 16 (Burlington
and Hunterdon), with Local 258's at 15. The County submits thai this bargaining
“compares very favorabiy" to carections officers in other counties in New
Jersey. [County Brief, p. 83}. The County provided comparisan charis which
include corrections officers in 20 counties. [Exs. C-1-57 & C-1-58]. Based upon
jhe County’s camparisons, lop salaries on salary guides range from $63,700
{Hunterdon} io $126,642 [Bergen], with Local 258's at $93,748 {and off-guide of
$94,581), starting salaries range from $29.802 {Union} to $47,352 (Morris), with
Local 258's at $40,000, and steps on the salary guides ronged from six (6) (Essex)

Jo 16 (Burlinglan and Hunterdon), with Local 258"s at 15

With respect io 31 local law enforcement units within Ocean County
municipalities, the PBA suomits that it does not compare fovorably to this
comparisan group. Based upon the P8A’s charts, top salaries on sclary guides
range from $66,274 (Island Heights} fo $157,481 (Toms Rivers}, with Local 258's ot

$93,748 (Slep 15} (off-guide of $96,581). [PBA Brief, pp. 60-61]. Bosed upon the

28
PBA's charts, starting salaries range from $34,392 [Ocean Gate} to $56,290
(Jackson), wilh Local 258's at 40,000. [Id. af 63-64]. Based upon the PBA’s
Charis, steps on the salary guides ranged from seven (7} (Island Heights} to 22

(Long Beach}, with Local 258's at 15. [Id. at 62].

Ihave reviewed the parties’ comparisons. in sum, the comparales show
that the County's Corrections Officers have 0 competitive salary and benefits
package that does noi require significant improvement or diminution at this

time.

Overall Compensation

The evidence in this matter, cs demonstrated by the parties’ exhibits and
the comporisons outiined above, shows [hal the overall compensotion received
by the County’s Corrections Officers is competitive. | conclude that the
evidence does not require full implementation of elther parly’s final offer. This
Award will serve the interesis and welfare of ihe public by sirking a balance
between maintaining the County's fiscal stabilily and providing bargaining unit
members with measured economic improvements fo base salary. This Award
takes into consideration thal the Counly has established the existence of strong
internal comparisons for its nan-law enforcement unils in 2019 ond 2020 for salary

increases and the status quo of Tier 4 contributions loward heallh benefits, as

29
well as giving due weight to the comparisons of corrections officers statewide.
Local law enforcement settlements were considered bul given lesser weight
than the olher cornparison groups as each municipality has ils own unique
bargaining history, socio-economic profile and tax rate structure, This Award
mointains the structural integrity af the current solary guide wilh some

improvement to the top step while allowing off-quide percentage increases thal

fall in line wiih the internal comparisons.

| considered this criterion but give it lesser weight than such factors as the
Counly's ability to pay. the lack of adverse financial impact, the interests and

welfare of the public, and public sector comparability.

Continuity and Stability of Employment

This criterion was considered in my review of the evidence. The evidence
does not show a significant deviation in the number of Corrections Officers in
the bargaining unit. In 2018, there were 174 Corrections Officers in the
bargaining unit. One (1) Corrections Officer resigned thal year. [Ex. C-1-85]. In
2019, there were 171 Corrections Officers in the bargaining. That year, three (3)
Corrections Officers resigned, one (1) retired, one {1} passed away, and ane (1)
was terminated. [Id]. Warden Sandra Mueller testified thai the County has
meinicined a complement of over 170 Corrections Officers despite the fact that

the average daily population has decreased from 688 in 2014 to 377 in 2019.

The County acknowledges that the PBA's proposal up lo “New Section B”
memorializes the current practice, bul he County opposes the remainder of the
PBA's proposal given thal no other Counly employee receives such a beneiit,
bargaining unit members “already receive a significant amount of time off”,
and “granting this proposal could increase the County's avertime cost and

increase the likelinood of mandatory overlime which would creale @ hardship

for both the County and C.O.s". [Cauniy Brief, pp. 56-57].

Upon the execution of this Agreement, full pay shall be
limited to sixiy (60) calendar days. Shouid an employee be
traumatically injured due to a violent atfack by an
individual(s) for the intended purpose of Causing severe harm

may chadse to be docked for that time.

The PBA seeks lo enhance ihe benefits under this provision by amending

Article 34 as follows:

The County opposes ihe PBA’s proposal. The Couniy seeks to eliminate
longuage that no longer applies and codify the current benefit through two (2)
modificotions: (1) in the first senience of the first paragraph, reploce “up to one
(1} year at full pay" with “up to sixty (40) calendar days at full pay", and {2}
delete the first sentence in the second paragraph. The County olso seeks to
include an eddilional limitation on the current provision by proposing to delete

the following from the third paragraph — "on an unrestricted/full-duty basis”.

Having reviewed the parties! proposals in conjunction the awarded items
as a whole and the evidence presented in this matter, the policy in Article 34
does not require modification other than coditying the current benefit as
proposed by the County. | award the County's proposal to (1} in the first
sentence of the first paragroph, replace “up to one (1) year at full pay” with “up
to sixty [60) calendar days al full pay”, and (2) delete the first sentence in the

second paragraph.

Other Modifications/Proposals on Economic {ssues not Awarded

As to the remainder of the porties’ modifications and proposals on the
economic issues, including out not limited to the PBA’s proposa's on automatic
step movement upon the contract expiration date, reductions to the Tier 4

contribution rates, and uniform allowance, all of which are benefits that do not

ca)
exist for any other County bargaining unii, and tne County's proposals ta modify
Atiicles 9IE) and 9{F), | thoroughly reviewed and considered their respective
positions. Having examined these items in conjunction with the supporting
evidentiary submissions | do not find sufficient justification to award them in
whole or in part at this time. | find that the improved economic changes that |
have awarded are reasonable and inclusive of what the financial impact of ihe
award should be while also faking inio consideration that the County's overall
financial obligations include having te fund the economic terms of all of its 21
bargaining units. The remaining modifications and proposais on the economic

issues are therefore rejected.

NON-ECONOMIC ISSUES

Vacation Leave - Article 14

Article 14 establishes vacation day entitlement based upon a requisite

number of years of service. The last sentence af Article 14 provides:

Bidding for vacations shall be based upon Civil Service
senictily, provided it does not create a shortage of
experienced Officers on a given shift.

The PBA proposes to eliminaie the sentence above and replace it with

the following:

42
Vacation time requests shall be awarded based upon
Departmental Seniarity. Vacation time off requests shall be
made within the first thirty (30) days of each calendar year
after the rebid shift change occurs and the new seniarity
schedules are implemented, and approval and/ar denial of
all requests shall be made within fifteen {15} days thereofter.
After completion of the initial thirty (30) day request period,
any requests for days off will be on a first come first serve
basis.

The County is amenable to including a modified version of the language
above as long as (1) the superior aificers have 30 days to respond to the
vacation requests and {2} the sentence that the PBA seeks to eliminaie remains
in place. Tne County submis that the elimination of tne relevant sentence

“could endanger every working C.O. on a parlicular shift, and of course the

inmates.” [County Brie, p. $8]

The evidence shows that a memorialization of the use af seniorily for the
purposes of requesting vacation would mutually benefit the parties, but it does
not establish that the sentence that the PBA seeks la eliminate is necessary or
best serves the public's interest. | award tne follawing language lo be added io

Atticle 14:

Vacalion time requests shall be awarded based upon
Departmental Seniority. Vacation time off requests shall be
made within the first thirty (30) days of each calendar year
after the rebid shift change occurs and the new seniarily
schedules ore implemented. and approval and/ar denial of
all requests shall be made within thirty {30) days thereafter.
After campletion of the initial thirly (30) day request period,

4B
any requests tor days off will be on a first come fist serve
basis,

Seniority ~ Article 27

Arlicle 27 ~ Seniority provides:

A. Seniorily shall be defined os an employee's
length of unbroken continuous service with the Department
of Corrections. Seniarity shall commence and begin to
accumulate from the employee's first day of appointment by
Ocean County as a duly sworn Correction Officer as
recegnized by Civil Service standards and accordingly by
any break in service.

B. The seniority system shall be administered
deportmentally. An employee will carry his/her seniovity from
one section, division ar unit of the department fo another.
Employees will not lose seniority rights if transferred from one
title or duly assignment fo another within the same rank.

C. The Warden shall hove the authority to designote
employees to a sixty (60} day troining period when filing a
new position wiihin the Deportment of Corrections.

D. The Warden sholl, regardiess of accumulated
seniority of employee (s) in question, have the authority to

a Officers shall have the sight to bid for their shift as
well as days off, when transfered into the division. The
Warden shall retain the sole autharity for Ihe assignment of
Officers to sections, divisions or units within the Department.

44
The PBA proposes to create new Sections B and C and to re-designate

the existing sections. The PBA's proposals provide:

8. The County shall implement and maintain a shift selection
and days off annual bidding process wiih the following
provisions being followed:

1. The employer shall post a seniority list by October 18 of the
preceding year.

2. Seniority bidding shall commence November 1:!.

3. The new schedule shall be posted by November 7" based
upon the bids that have been awarded,

4, The new schedule, which is the resull of the seniority

7, No individual shall be denied their seniority selection due
to discrimination.

C. Upon the completian of the annual bidding process each
Officer assigned ta the Security Unit, on their respective shift,
will have the right fo bid for their working post{sj for each of

of thal year.

The PBA's brief includes ratianale for this proposal:

Finally, one of the most imporlan? praposals put farh by
P.B.A. #258 seeks to modify Article 27 entitied “Seniority.” To
this end, P.B.A, #258's proposal seeks to coaify the shill and
past bidding process thet have been adhered ta by the
parties for ihe past several years. For the Arbiiratar's
‘eference, shift bidding periains fo the shift a member works,
such as 7:00 a.m. to 3:00 p.m., whereas pos! bidding refers ta
the specific assignment o member works during his/her shift,
such as being assigned to a tower or a cerlain detention
area

By way of background, in 2014. the then-Warden af the
Ocean County Depcrimeni of Corrections, Theodore Hutler,
executed an agreement with P.8.A. #258 referred to as the
“Three Year Rule.” (Exhibit PBA-1-27). The agreement expressly
provided far shift and post bidding for P.B.A. #258 members
and was effective for the 2015 and 2016 calendar years.
(1T65:3-4}. The first section of the agreement outlined the units
and/or assignments the Warden retained ihe unfettered right
to assign members ta, irrespective of the posi bidding
process. {1163:22-64: Nevertheless, these unils and/or
assignments were subject io the shitt bidding process, thereby

  

46
allowing P.B.A. #258 members fo bid upon the specific shiff
they would work. Ibid.

The second seclion of the “Three Year Rule" provided
post bidaing rights for those members assigned to the Security
Division (Exhibit PBA-1-27; 1164:2-11]. For clarity, the Security
Division contains multiple posts, ta include ihase directly
supervising inmates, relief assignmenis, and roving patrol
assignments. Ibid. To this end, this section of the agreement
allowed P.B.A. #258 members to bid upon their respective
posts and/or assignments based upon seniarity. (1T64:8-11}.

As explained by President Woods, the agreement was
entitled the “Three Year Rule" because any member who
possessed less than three [3] years with the Ocean Counly
Department of Carrections was nat eligiple to engage in the
post bidding process:

Q. And this particular agreement, Luke, was calied the
Three-Year Rule and | think the warden labeled that
because it lasted for three years; is that correct?

A. No, that was filled because of any officer that
didn't have...three years within tne department
wouldn't have the righi io bid for the posi inside the
security unit, although the afficers in charge allowed
them to bid. They also—they understood that they were
subject to being replaced or being moved ta a
different post at will and anyone that had three years
or more within a department would be placed—would
choose their post and noi be able to be moved from
their post.

(1764:12-65:2.]

Upon expiratian of the “Three Year Rule” Agreement, a
subsequent agreement was reached belween P.B-A. #258
and now-Warden Mueller. (1165:7-10). This agreement was
colloquially refered to as “The Five-Year Rule" Agreement.
(Exhibit PBA-1-28; 1766:7-9). This subsequent agreement. in
essence, continued the shift and past bidding processes and
benefits contained in the “Three Year Rule" Agreement for
2016 through fhe expiration of the instant collective
negotialions agreement. {1165:16-66:2}. However, the name

47
of the agreement was changed to ihe "Five Year Rute”
because the P.B.A. #258 membership was gelling a bit cider
and, thus, the post bidding process would only be available
to those members who possessed five (5} years with fhe
Department, as opposed to three {3} years in the prior
agreement. {1766:7-14).

The “Five Year Rule” Agreement also slightly modified
the units and/or assignments the Warden retained discretion
over and tne units and/or assignments that were subject to
ine pest bidding pracess, {1186:15-25). Nevertneless, the “Five
Year Rule" Agreement continued the bidding pracess for cll
open assignments. Ibid. The Agreement also allowed a “re-
bid" halfway through the year so as fo allow members to
chonge posis and/or assignments, if they so desired. Ibid,
Outside of these minor modifications, everything ‘rom the
“Three Year Rule" Agreement remained the same. This was
concisely explained by President Waods:

This agreement which we come te os we called it the—
we ended up changing it to the Five-Year Rule and the
reasan we changed it to five yeors is the department
was getting a little bil older ond we didn't—so snyone
with less than five years would be subject to removal
from their post that they bid for within security and
anyone with more than five years would net.

With that we also changed—came to an agreement
on what units the warden could place officers in based
upon deparimental seniority. We continued Ihe re-
bidding of any apen assignment posts. We allowed io
do a past re-bid haifway through the year, so if officers
wanted ta and could, you know based upon their
seniority. they could change their posi halfway through
the year. Thot was basically it. Like | said, everything
else was the same,

(1166:7-25.]

The shift and post bidding provided in the “five Year
Rule” Agreement was continued through ihe expiration of the
Collective negotiations agreement on June 30, 2019.
Accarding to President Woods, the Agreement is being
followed at the current time. (\167:13-68:3). To Ihis end, each

48
and every component of the Agreement is being followed
wilh the exception of post bidding. Ibid. However, Warden
Mueller has deferred to the respective Officers in Chorge of
each shift as to whether to offer post bidding. Ibid. Of the
three (3) shifts available, Iwo (2) of the Officers in Charge
have allowed the post bidding to continue. Ibid, The final
Officer in Charge has not pul the respective posts for bidding.
but the post assignments that were awarded based upon the
las? bidding process have remained in place. Ibid, in other
words, here has not yet been a need to pul the assignments
up for bidding 0s of yet

In its proposal, P.B.A. #258 seeks io codify the "Five Year
Ruie” into the collective negotiations agreement, thereby
preserving the shit and posi bidding processes that have
been followed for the past five {5} years. (1T68:8-12).
Moreover, the proposol seeks to institute certain deadlines as
to when the respective bidding processes will commence
and when ihe shifts and/or posts will be awarded.

While recognizing the Warden and, by extension, the
Caunty retains great discretion as te assigning ceriain
individuals to certain posts and/or assignments, the shift and
posi bidding processes are of vital importance fo the P.B.A.
#258 membership. Specifically, these bidding processes
promote stability in members’ personal lives as well as boost
their moraie in getting io work a shift, post, ar assignment
which they desire, This was detailed by Presiden! Waads
during the caurse of his direct testimony:

@. How impartant, Luke, is it to your members to have
the ability to bid for their shifts, their days off, as well as
their pasts?

A. | mean the shifis and days off. ! mean that's jusi—
that's obvious you know. You want to get the best shift
and the best days off that work for you and your
family...if just boosts morale for the post bidding within
the department.

You're stuck within the confines of the jail. II's nice to

be able to wark whether it's the same pest every day
or the same past with the same partner every day or

49
just the posi that you want to be working al as
opposed fo being told that you hove to work there.

[1768:19-69:6.)

President Woods olso detoiled the importance of the
continuity that shift and post bidding provides in maintaining
the security of the correctionol facility:

Q. And as far as the octual security in running the jail,
‘Luke, with continuity of individuals working at the some
post is that important as well?

A. Absolutely. The biggest thing wiih—goes bock to
dealing with inmates. Inmates are on a schedule within
the facility and that schedule works because the
inmates know what to do, when to do it, eat when to
ect, sleep when to sieep, so it works for them. And in
turn, it goes some for the officers because we're in
there just os much as they ore, so to allow us to have
ihat continuity of being in the same spot or the same—
on the same post or doing the same job with the same
people every day, it makes your day go better and |
think it gets you a better officer out of if. And that all
came abou! when the new jail was designed.

Warden Hutler had come Up with a policy that officers
hod to work the same post five days a week and then
that was done by seniority, not as an agreemeni, but
thai's what he wanted because he wanted the
continuily cf the same officer being in the same unit
because il's ihe same inmates day in and day oui and
so the unil should run the same if it’s the same officer
day in and day out which means you'll nave tess
problems.

(1189:7-70:7.]

Lastly, President Woods explained how the shift and
post bidding processes ensure that officers get to know the
inmates they are responsible for in their particular unit and/or
assignment, thereby furthering security and stability in the
facility as well:

50
@. And os far as the officers having the ability to
actually know the inmates that are housed within their
unit with the post tha? they work, how imporiant is thet
fo safely ond security as well?

A. It's very important because if you work with the
same inmate every day you may know an inmate, just
their attitude. Knowing who the inmate is and how to
deal with the inmate because you work there day in
and day out makes it, one, makes it easier to work in
the unit, but two, makes it sofer becouse one inmate
moy work a uni! five days a week and know that
inmate so-and-so tends io gel heated over a game of
cards. And | understand that if’s not an argument; it's
just how he expresses himself. But if it’s someone
different every day, that person may not understand
that and see thot inmate get healed ond possibly think
thai there's semething starling to happen. Then the
officer could possibly get involved which then could
lead into a bunch of different scenarios.

So if you have the same person there, you know, ond
typically when we bid for our posts the mast senior guys
are bidding the same post five days a week.
Sometimes it's three doys here, two days there as a
break, but being thal i's done by seniority, they
typically choose the same spot every day so they have
that continuity.

[11708-71:9.]

in opposition to the proposal, the County elicited
jestimony from Warden Mueller and Deputy Warden Valenti
indicating that the Deportment and, more specifically,
Officers in Charge must maintain discretion to assign officers
to posts they deem appropriate given each officer's unique
set of skills, strengths, and/or weakness. {17153:13-154:19; 202:
Moreover, the Counly seems to argue thal this discretion must
be maintained in light of lhe changes to the correctional
facility on account of bail reform, nomely the decrease in the
inmate population. Thus, according to the County, the
Deparlment must be provided the abilify to assign officers 1o
different pos!s when certain posts needs fo be closed and/or
callapsed on account of the population fluctuation.

51
The County's arguments in opposition to the proposal
are somewhat hollow. First, ii is undisputed that the County
and/or Department have been abiding by either the "Three-
Year Rule” or “Five-Year Rule” Agreemenis for Ihe past five (5)
years. Thus, any assertion that the implementation of shifl and
post bidding processes contained in the agreemenis have a
detrimental impact upon the safety and security of the
correctional facility are without merit. Simply put, if the shift
and post bidding selection processes had an adverse impoct
‘on safely and/or security, the “Three-Year Rule” Agreement
would not have been, in essence, renéwed through
implementation of the “Five-Yeor Rule” Agreement. Further,
os detailed by President Woods, utilizotion of the shift and
post bidding processes aciually enhonced sofely and
security at the facility, nol compromised it-

Additionally, cognizant of the Department's need to
close certoin posts and/or assignments on occasion,
President Wooas testified thot the reassignment of mernbers
in such circumstances hos been accepted by P.B.A. #258
ang, thus, would not constitute a violation of this language if
the proposal is ullimately awarded:

Q. And ff they [P.B.A. #258 members] have bid on a
particular posi and the County is maving them
someplace else, in effect fhe County would be in
violation of the contract, wouldn't they?

A, No, there's an understanding thot if o post closed—
we've already had this incident, Ihat if a post closed
the officer understands that he's not going to be in that
post, or by selecling a post there may be the—
because of projects going on within the jail that he
may be reassigned to a different sost or as an extra
because his post is now vacant.

[17113:9-20.]
Warden Mueller confirmed this understanding during
her cross-examination and expressly indicated that the shiff

and post bidding processes being utilized, subject to
reassignments being necessitated due to the closure of

52
certain posts, have not resulted in any issues in running the
focifity:

Q. And you were here when Officer Woods testified,
conmect?

A. Yes.

@. And Officer Woods, you heard him state that the
PBA had no issues with officers being moved during —
due to the fact that pasts were being closed, correct?

A. Correct...

@. And you testified that you have two OCs [Officers
in Charge] that are still currently following the Five-Year
Rule?

A. They're allowing people fo bid for their post, but
then they have the authorily as OIC to move people
around as they see fit regardless of where the person
bid.

Q. And given that they're still implementing and
following the Five-Year Rule since | guess you believe it
expired at the end of June, | take il there haven't been
ony issues with it thus fare

A. There haven't been any issues because when
officers needs to be deployed or redepioyed it can
happen.

[1T358:8-1 60:4.)

Lastly, ine County seems io take the position thot P.B.A.
#258's proposal in its cument form seems to allow P.8.A. #258
members to bid on Iheir posts and/or assignment each and
every day. (1T202:3-8}. This is not the intention of the proposal.
Instead, the proposal allows members to bid for the post
and/or assignment they would work five (5) days a week, not
allow © bid for each post each and every day. Such an
aperoach would be nonsensical and daes nat accurately
teflect what is being sought by P.B.A. #258 as referenced in
President Woods’ testimony.

53
After reviewing the reasoning behind the proposal and
acknowledging the fact that shift and post bidding has been
utilized by the Department for the past five (5} years, P.B.A.
#258's propesal must be owarded. Quite simply, codification
of the shift and post bidding processes is necessitated to
ensure this benefit is preserved jor P.8.A. #258 members going
forward. Additionally, the award of this proposal furthers
continuity in the operation of the correctional facility. thereby
fostering safety and security for not only P.B.A. #258 members,
but inmates and civilian personnel as well. [PBA Brief, pp. 104-
2].

The Counly is not opposed ie the inclusion of porlions of the PBA's
proposal as it applies to shift bidding and time aff, but it rejects the remainder of
the PBA's proposal far operational reasons and contends that it infringes upon

the County's managerial rights:

‘The PBA has proposed to revamp the seniority article of
the CBA. The County agrees that seniority as it applies to shift
bidding and time off should control, and in fact, it does.
Moreover, the procedural aspects of seniority also are
appropriate for inclusion in o CBA. {Section 8 (1). (2), (3} and
(4}). However, the County strongly disagrees tha seniority
should control with regard to assignments. Section 8 (5) and
C (i), (2) and {3} do exactly that.

The Department has been very fair about assignments.
First, Warden Hutler entered inio the "3-Year Rule" with the PBA.
regarding assignments. Second, Warden Mueller entered inlo
the "5-Year Rule" with the PBA. Both the "3-Year Rule” and the
"5-Year Rule" [sunsetied} on the last day of the agreements.
Warden Mueller did not review the "5-Year Rule” because of
the dramatic change in the operations of the correction
facilifies due to the Ball Reform Act.

On cross-examination, C.O. Woods admitted that there
has been a dramatic change in operations because of Bail

54
Reform. Woods conceded tha! dye to the decline in inmate
population, posits are frequently closed and the assigned
C.O.'s have to be re-assigned. {Ir 104:6 - 107:1).

Warden Mueller explained thai the bidding an
assignments provided by the "5-Year Rule” no longer worked
because Bail Reform has caused so many changes in a short
span of fime. At one point, six {4) units in the jail were closed
(Tr. 140: 6-19]. Mueller explained that re-assignments had to
be made based upon the skills needed for the assignment.
The Warden relies on the judgement of the OIC [Officer in
Charge) to make the appropriate reassignment. Moreover,
she explained the assignments can be very different even
though they are allin the same facility. (Tr. 140:15 - 143:24).

Since of the "5-Year Rule" has expired, Iwo (2} out of the
three (3) OIC's have continued to allow their C.0.'s to bid
their posis with the undersianding that if the post is closed,
ihe officer will be reassigned. {Tr. 143:22 - 14:12). Mueller
stated that the elimination of the "S-Year Rule” has noi had a
negative impact. (Tr. 144:13-16). At the conclusion of her
testimony, Warden Mueller emphasized the imporlance of
having the flexibility and discretion io reassign C.0.'s lo those
posts where they were the"... righ! king of officer or the right
kind af skills and abilities ... everybody is just nat acrass the
board the same kind of personality when if comes to dealing
with inmates." {Tr. 145: 5-20}.

Deputy Warden Valenti corroborated = Muetler’s
testimony and even went info greater detail regarding the
difference in the assignmenis (Ir. 179 - 184:13). Valenti
explained the difference between shift bidding and bidding
on posts, or in other words, assignments (Tr. 206:20 - 210:11}
The Deputy Warden specifically said he supports shift bidding.
(Tr. 210:12-14]. However, he oppased past bidding. When
asked on cross if ihere were any issues with post bidding,
Volenti gave specific exampies of C.O.'s balking at
reassignments different than their bidded post. (Tr. 208: 23 -
210:13).

Officer Weoas insinuated in his testimany that if the PBA
Senioriiy Proposal was awarded and C.©.'s had to be
reassigned, the PBA would not have a problem with the PBA.
(Tr. 107:3-15). Unfortunately, doing that would be in vialatian

55
of Proposal Number 2. Seniority and the County would likely
be in grievance arbitration. There is a reason why the County
hos proposed “looser pays” in the County's grievance
arbitration proposal.

Finally, and probably most importantly. the low does
not support the PBA’s proposal. The Public Employment
Commission has ruled for years hat tne employer has a nen-
negotiable prerogative to assign employees to meet ihe
governmental policy goa) of matching the best qualified
employees to particular jobs. New Jersey Transit Corp. v. PBA
Locol 304, 32 NIPER 142, 2006 West Law 6824445 (Oct. 26,
2006}{PERC restrained arbitration, helding that “arbitrator may

officers were best suited for undercover assignments."};

representotives may agree ihat seniority can be a faciar in
shifl selection where all qualifications are equal, managericl
prerogalives are not otherwise compromised. and. the
employer retains the right to deviate from the procedures
where necessary ‘¢ accomplish a governmental policy goal.
Caunty of Hudsor_y. PBA Local 109A, 42 NJPER 32, 2015 West
Law 5604425 [Aug. 13, 2015} (finding that clause in Agreement
“was not mandatorily negotiable because } appears to
mandate that shift assignments be based solely on seniority
and does not appear to preserve management’ s right to

 

 

56
deviate from a seniority shift assignment system lo accomplish
its governmental policy goals.”}.

In conclusion, besides the law being very clear
regarding this proposal, the PBA has not demonsiraied a
need for it. C.O. Woods and Warden Mueller both testified
that the County has prudently exercised its discretion
regarding assignments. Therefore, given the dramatic

chonges in operations due to the Bail Reform Act, this
proposal should be rejected. [County srief, pp. 58-61].

Having considered the parties’ arguments in conjunction with the
evidence presented in support of their respective positions, | award the PBA’s
proposals to creale and include new Section B{]}-(4), but | conclude that the
PBA has met ils burden to prove that the remainder of the proposal reauires

implementation ai this time.

Agency Shop Provision - Ariicle 28

The current Agreement! includes an agency shop provision. The County's
proposes fo eliminate this provision. The PBA did not expressly address the merits
of the County's propesal in its post-hearing brief. Agency shop fees are now
illegal pursuant Janus v, AFSMCE, Council 31, ef al, 585 U.S. (2028). Put
simply, the provision is Inconsistent with prevailing law. | award the elimination of

this provision while adding new language in its place as follows:

57
The parties recognize and shall be guided by the terms of the
Workplace Democracy Enhancement Act as set forth in
NSA. 34:134-5.11,

Other Modifications/Proposals on Non-Economic !ssues not Awarded

As to the remainder of the parties’ modifications and proposals on the
non-economic. issues, including but net limited to the PBA’s proposal on

and the County's proposals with respect fo Article 6 — Uniform Maintenance
Allowance and Article 2) — Grievance Procedure, | thoroughly reviewed and
considered their respective positions. Having examined these items in

justification to award them in whole or in part and, therefore, are rejecied.

BACKGROUND

The County describes itself os "Ihe secand largest county in the staie
containing 638 square miles of pine barrens and barrier islands and a 45-mile
coostiine along the Allantic Ocean." The Counly's census population in 2010
was 576,567, As of July 1, 2018, ihe County's population was estimated to be

601,651.

The County hos 21 borgaining units, seven (7) of which are law
enforcement unils. P8A Local No. 258 represents the County's Carrection
Officers, excluding Sergeants, Lieutenants and Captains. Tke duratian of the

parties’ most recent Agreement is from April 1, 2016 through June 30, 2019.

As of June 30, 2019, there were 174 bargaining unit members in Local 258.
Accarding fa PBA Local Union President iucion Woods. there are currentty 171

borgaining unit members in the unit. [1:16].

The parties presented a vast amaunt of evidence during the praceedings.
They also supmitted detailed, comprehensive briefs and certifications fo support
iheir respective positions and to rebut those of the opposing party. The parties
urge the acceptance of their respective proposals. As the arbitrator noted in W

Windsor Tp & PBA Local 271, 1A-2009-014 (Mastriani 2019), the strict and timiled

18
time constraints under the law do nol permit the arbitrator 70 provide an

exhaustive summary of the evidence presented, However, these submissions

have been thoroughly reviewed and considered in rendering a final Award on

the parties" proposals.

DISCUSSION

Lam required lo make a reasonable determination of the issues, giving

due weight to the statutory criteria set forih in N.JS.A. 34:13A-16(g}. The

 

statutory criteria are as follows:

(1)

(2)

The interests and welfare of the public. Among the items the
arbitrator or panel of arbitrators shall cssess when considering
this factor are the limitations imposed upon the ernployer by
(P.L. 1976, c. 68 (C. 40A:4-45.1 ef seq.)

Comparison of the wages, salaries, hours, and conditions of
employment of the employees involved in the arbitration
proceedings with the wages, hours, and conditions af
employment of other employees performing the same or
similar services and with other employees generally:

ia} In private emplayment in general provided,
however, each parly shail have the right fo
submil additional evidence for ihe arbitrator's
consideration,

{b) In. public employment in general; provided,
however, each party shall have the right to
supmil additional evidence for the arbitrator's
consideration

19
(3)

(4)

{5}

(6)

(7)

 

In public employment in the same or similar
comparable jurisdictions, as determined in
accordance with section 5 of PL. 1995. C. 425
(C.34:13A-16.2) provided, however, each parly
shall have the right to submit additional evidence
concerning the comparabllty of jurisdictions for
the arbitrator's consideration.

The overall compensation presently received by the
employees, inclusive of direct wages, salary, vacations,
holidays, excused leaves, insurance and pensions, medical
and hespitalizotion benefits, and all olner economic benefils
received.

Stipulations of the parlies.

The lawful authority of the employer. Among the items the
arbitrator or pane! of arbitretors shall assess when considering
this factor are the limitations imposed upon the employer by
the P.L. 1976 c. 68 (C.40A:4-45 ef seq,].

The financial impact en the governing unit, ils residents and
taxpayers. When considering this factor ina dispute in which
tne public empioyer is a county or a municipality, the
orbitrator or panel of arbitrators shall take into account to the
extent that evidence is introduced, how the award will affect
the municipal or county purposes element, as the case may
be, of the locat property tax: a comparison of the
perceniage of the municipol purposes element, or in the
case of a county, the county purposes element, required to
fund the employees’ contract in the preceding local budget
year with that required under the award for Ihe current local
budget year; the impact of the award for each income
sector of the property taxpayers on the local unit; the impact
of the award on ihe abilily of the governing body {o (a)
mainidin existing loca! progroms and services, [b} expand
existing local programs ond services for which public meneys
have been designated by the governing body in a proposed
local budget, or (c} initiate any new programs and services
for which public moneys have been designated by the
governing body in its proposed local budget.

The cost of living.

20
{8} The continuity and stability of employment incluaing seniority
fights and such other factors not confined to the foregoing
which are ordinarily or traditionally considered in the
determination of wages, hours and conditions of employment
through collective negotiations and collective bargaining
between jhe parties in the public service and in private
employment.

{9} Statutory restrictions imposed on the employer. Among the
items the arbitrator or panel of arbitrators shail assess when
considering this factor are the limitations imposed upon the
employer by section 10 of P.L. 2007, c. 62 (C.-40A:4-45.45).

All of the statutory factors are relevant, but they are not necessarily
eniiled to equal weight. | am required to make a reasonable determination of
the issues with a reasoned explanation for the award. | must also indicate which
slatutory factors are deemed relevant, the due weight that was given to each
factor, and which factors, if any, are deemed to be irrelevant, The criteria also
provide me with the authority to consider other such factors not confined to
those specifically stated which are ordinarily or jraditionally considered in the
determination of wages, hours and conditions of employment. [N.J.S.A. 34:13A-
16{g){8)]._ In this case, | conclude that the interests and welfare of the public,
the public sector comparisons (intemal and external), and the financial impact
on the governing unit, is residents, and taxpayers must be given greater weight
than such other factors as the cost of living and private sector comparisons. |
have also given due weight to the faci that this Award will not require the
County to exceed its lawful authority or any statutory restrictions. The party
seeking a change i an existing term or condition of employment bears the

at
burden of justifying the proposed change, { have considered my decision to
award or deny any individual issue in dispute as part of the overall terms that |
have awarded, along with the continuation of contract terms and benefits thai

are not in dispute.

Interests and Welfare of the Public

interest Arbitrators in New Jersey have widely recognized that “tlhe
interests and welfare of the public [N.J.S.A. NuJ.S.A. 34:13A+16g11)] is paramount
because it is a criterion that embraces many of the ather factors and recognizes
their relationships.” Washington Tp & PBA Local 307, |A-2009-053 {Mastriani 2012);
see irvingion Tp & Irvington Police Superior Olficers Association, (A-2019-010
{Osborn 2019}; W Windsor Tp & PBA Local 271, 1A-2009-014 (Mastriani 2019):
Boonton & PBA Local 212, 1A-2019-021 (Kronick 2019}. I now reviow the interests

and welfare criterion through the other statutory factors addressed below.

Lawful Authority of the Employer/Financial Impact on the Governing Unit, Its
Residents and Toxpayers/Statutory Restrictions Imposed on the Empioyer
NSA. 34:12A-16g{1], (5). (6) and {9} refer to the (awful authority of the
employer, the financial impact of the award, and fhe statutory restrictions
imposed on the employer. The PBA contends that the County “has nol

presented sufficient, substantial, and/or concrete evidence to establish an

22
inobility io pay P.8.A #258 members the wage increases and other economic
incentives thai have been requested." [PBA Brief, p. 122]. It is true thot the
County does not claim an inabilliy to pay up to ihe statutory permitted levels,
but it submits that the PBA’s Final Offer “is clearly an excessive demand that will
hove a substantial negative impact on the County both in the short term and in
the future; especially since if will have a huge impact on negotiations with the
County's other 20 unions." [County Brief, p. 92]. | conclude thal the evidentiary
racord developed during this proceeding does not require the awarding of
either party's proposals in their entirety. This Award will not have an adverse
impact upon the County, its taxpayers and residents, and il will nol prohibit the
County from meeting its statutory obligations or cause it to exceed ils jawful
authority. Further, this Aword serves the interests and welfare of the public

through a thorough weighing of ail of the statutory crileria.

Comparability

Private Employment

Given the unique nature of public safety positions, the comparison to
private employment has not been allotted significant weight in previous interest
orbifration awords. There continues fo be an absence of evidence to support a

deviation fram giving greater weight to public sector comparisans.

23
Public Employment in General/in the Same or Similar Jurisdictions

With respect to public employment, the PBA presented comparisons of
this bargaining unit included, but were not fimited io (1) low enforcement
officers within the municipal police departments in Ocean County, (2)
Corrections Officers in counly facilities statewide, and (3) the County's civilian
bargaining units. The Counly presented o general comparison of this
bargaining unif to public and private empioyment. The County contends that
the internal comparability of its 21 bargaining units, including the likelihood that
this award would give substantial weight fo the internal comporabilily factor
and/or a pattern of settlement for 2019 and 2020, must be given greater weight
than fhe PBA's Comparison with other municipal police officers in Ocean
County. | note that the collective negotiations agreements between the
County and its six {6) other law enforcement units (Corrections Superiors - PBA
Local 258A, Sheriff's Officers — PBA Local 379, Sheriff's Superiors — PBA Local 379A,
Prosecutor's Detectives and investigators — PBA Local 171, Prosecutor's
Sergeants’ Association, and Prosecutor's Supetior Officers Association) all have
an expiration date of June 38, 2019 and, as of the date of the interes? arbitration

hearing, had not reached terms for successor contracts.

PERC's website includes the most recent salary increase analysis for

interest arbitration awards for calendar years 2012 through 2017. The average

24
increase for post-2011 2% cases was 1.71% for calendar year 2015, 1.94% for
2016, and 2.05% for 2017. The average increase for non-interest arbitration
settlements in 2016 was 3.16% and 3.53% in 2017. | considered this information in
rendering the Award, but | emphasize that the 2% base salary "Hard Cap" has
sunset and, therefore. the awards and setllemenis that were seni under the cap

are not dispositive as to the outcome of this matter.

PERC's website also includes four (4) interes} arbitration awards that have
been issued for post-2% base salary “Hard Cap” impasses: Hopewell Tp & PBA
Loc 342, |A-2019-016 (Osborn 2019} appealed buf affirmed by Commission
P.ER.C. No. 2020-11 (8/15/19), Bedminster Tp & PBA Loc 366, IA-2019-017 (Kronick
2019] appealed but affirmed by Commission P.E,R.C. No. 2020-10 (8/15/19}, W
Windsor Tp & PBA Local 271, IA-2009-014 (Mastriani 2019}, and Boonton & PBA
Loc 212, 1A-2019-021 (Kronick}. Each award pertained to a law enforcement
unil in a municipality. In each instance, the collective negotiations organization
proposed fo reduce the Tier 4 levels that borgaining unit members were
requited ta contribute towards health benefits. in each instance, the orbitrator
did not award the propasa!l. As to base salary, the arbitrator in Hopewell froze
the starting salary for 2019 through 2021, increased all other steps Gn the 2019
guide by 2.2%, increased the top step by 2%, added one [1] step, and froze all
other steps in 2020, and for 2021 increased all steps (except starting salary) by

1.8%. Sleo advancement was provided in eoch year of the contract In

25
Bedminster, the orbitrator froze the solary guide for 2019 except the tap siep
which was increased by 2%. The arbitrator hen awarded across-the-board
increases of 2% in 2019, 2% in 2020, and 2% in 2021. Step advancement was
provided in each year of the contract. In W Windsor, the arbitrator awarded
across-the-board increases of 2% in 2019, across-ihe-board increases of 2% in
2020, across-the-board increases 2.25% in 2021, and across-the-board increases
of 2.25% in 2022. Slep advancement was provided in each year of the
contract. Lastly, in Boonton, the arbitrator awarded across-the-board increases
of 2.25% plus a $1,000 adjustment at the top step in 2019, across-the-board
increases of 2.25% plus a $1,000 adjustment at the top step in 2020, and across-
the-board increases 2.25% plus a $1,000 adjusiment at the top step in 2021. Step
advancement was provided in each year of the contract. in each award, the
orbitrater reviewed the evidence cansidered fo be the most unique and

relevant in each of the Municipalities.

| also reviewed the parlies’ internal comparisons. The PBA emphasized
that “the County's civilian bargaining units were not subjected to the restrictions
of the Iwo percent (2%) solary cap os their members do nat serve as law
enforcement officers and, thus, cannol avali themselves of the interest
arbitration process. As such, as compared to their law enforcement
counterparts, many Counly civilian bargaining unit employees were able fe

secure somewhal generous percentage increases to their salaries for ihe several

26
years during the twa percent (2%) salary cap's existence and applicability.”
[PBA Brief, p. 69]. Moreover, “during thal some period of time the salary guide
for P.B.A. #258 members was dramatically expanded and the maximum salary
afforded fo members remained stagnant.” [Id], The PBA stressed Inot “pattern
of setilement™ does nol exist al this time and cannot control the outcome of this
matter. The County emphasized other factors. For instance, the County
indicated that of its “approximately 1.850 fulltime employees and a few
hundred port-time employees” that “65 out of the top 300 paid County
employees are Corrections Officers." [ld. at 79; see Ex. C-1-103], Moreover, “all
settlemenis for Ocean County CBAs expiring in 2020 and 2021 provide for a 1.9%
or flat dollar increase for 2019 and 2020. [See Ex. C-1-100]. The County also
emphasized thot all other County ernployees continue to contribute at Tier 4
levels for their health benefits. All of the infernal and external comparisons were

considered and weighed along with all of ihe other stolutory factors.

As to corrections officers in other counties in New Jersey, the PBA indicates
that the bargaining unit fils within the “middle of the pack” of Ihe comparisan
group that il views as “the most appropriate comparison” for ils sclary proposal.
[PBA Brief, 0. 45]. The PBA presented comparison charls. [id at 65-47]. Based
upon the BA's charts, which include comparative data for Bergen, Monmouth,
Middlesex, Mortis, Passaic and Hudson, top salaries on salary guides range from

$91,278 {Camden} to $126,642 [Bergen], with Local 258’s al $93,748 (Step 15}

27
land off-guide of $96,581). Based upen Ihe PBA's charts, which include
comporative data far Mortis, Bergen, Gloucester, Essex and Camden, slarting
salaries range from Lacal 258's at $40,000 to $47,352 (Maris). Based upon the
PBA's charls, which include comparative data for Essex, Mercer, Bergen,
Middlesex, Possaic, Warren, Union, Hudsan, Salem, Atianlic, Sussex, Carnden,
Gloucester. Somerset, Monmouth, Moris, Cumberland, Hunterdon and
Burlington, sieps on the salary guides renged from six (6) {Essex} fo 16 (Burlington
and Hunterdon), with Local 258's at 15. The County submits thai this bargaining
“compares very favorabiy" to carections officers in other counties in New
Jersey. [County Brief, p. 83}. The County provided comparisan charis which
include corrections officers in 20 counties. [Exs. C-1-57 & C-1-58]. Based upon
jhe County’s camparisons, lop salaries on salary guides range from $63,700
{Hunterdon} io $126,642 [Bergen], with Local 258's at $93,748 {and off-guide of
$94,581), starting salaries range from $29.802 {Union} to $47,352 (Morris), with
Local 258's at $40,000, and steps on the salary guides ronged from six (6) (Essex)

Jo 16 (Burlinglan and Hunterdon), with Local 258"s at 15

With respect io 31 local law enforcement units within Ocean County
municipalities, the PBA suomits that it does not compare fovorably to this
comparisan group. Based upon the P8A’s charts, top salaries on sclary guides
range from $66,274 (Island Heights} fo $157,481 (Toms Rivers}, with Local 258's ot

$93,748 (Slep 15} (off-guide of $96,581). [PBA Brief, pp. 60-61]. Bosed upon the

28
PBA's charts, starting salaries range from $34,392 [Ocean Gate} to $56,290
(Jackson), wilh Local 258's at 40,000. [Id. af 63-64]. Based upon the PBA’s
Charis, steps on the salary guides ranged from seven (7} (Island Heights} to 22

(Long Beach}, with Local 258's at 15. [Id. at 62].

Ihave reviewed the parties’ comparisons. in sum, the comparales show
that the County's Corrections Officers have 0 competitive salary and benefits
package that does noi require significant improvement or diminution at this

time.

Overall Compensation

The evidence in this matter, cs demonstrated by the parties’ exhibits and
the comporisons outiined above, shows [hal the overall compensotion received
by the County’s Corrections Officers is competitive. | conclude that the
evidence does not require full implementation of elther parly’s final offer. This
Award will serve the interesis and welfare of ihe public by sirking a balance
between maintaining the County's fiscal stabilily and providing bargaining unit
members with measured economic improvements fo base salary. This Award
takes into consideration thal the Counly has established the existence of strong
internal comparisons for its nan-law enforcement unils in 2019 ond 2020 for salary

increases and the status quo of Tier 4 contributions loward heallh benefits, as

29
well as giving due weight to the comparisons of corrections officers statewide.
Local law enforcement settlements were considered bul given lesser weight
than the olher cornparison groups as each municipality has ils own unique
bargaining history, socio-economic profile and tax rate structure, This Award
mointains the structural integrity af the current solary guide wilh some

improvement to the top step while allowing off-quide percentage increases thal

fall in line wiih the internal comparisons.

| considered this criterion but give it lesser weight than such factors as the
Counly's ability to pay. the lack of adverse financial impact, the interests and

welfare of the public, and public sector comparability.

Continuity and Stability of Employment

This criterion was considered in my review of the evidence. The evidence
does not show a significant deviation in the number of Corrections Officers in
the bargaining unit. In 2018, there were 174 Corrections Officers in the
bargaining unit. One (1) Corrections Officer resigned thal year. [Ex. C-1-85]. In
2019, there were 171 Corrections Officers in the bargaining. That year, three (3)
Corrections Officers resigned, one (1) retired, one {1} passed away, and ane (1)
was terminated. [Id]. Warden Sandra Mueller testified thai the County has
meinicined a complement of over 170 Corrections Officers despite the fact that

the average daily population has decreased from 688 in 2014 to 377 in 2019.

The County acknowledges that the PBA's proposal up lo “New Section B”
memorializes the current practice, bul he County opposes the remainder of the
PBA's proposal given thal no other Counly employee receives such a beneiit,
bargaining unit members “already receive a significant amount of time off”,
and “granting this proposal could increase the County's avertime cost and

increase the likelinood of mandatory overlime which would creale @ hardship

for both the County and C.O.s". [Cauniy Brief, pp. 56-57].

After due consideration of the entire record, | award a modification thot

an injury occurs on the job the affected Officer shall be
covered for up to one {1} year at full pay. All other existing
County policies relotirig io on the job injury benefits shall be
continued.

Upon the execution of this Agreement, full pay shall be
limited to sixiy (60) calendar days. Shouid an employee be
traumatically injured due to a violent atfack by an
individual(s) for the intended purpose of Causing severe harm

may chadse to be docked for that time.

The PBA seeks lo enhance ihe benefits under this provision by amending

Article 34 as follows:

The County opposes ihe PBA’s proposal. The Couniy seeks to eliminate
longuage that no longer applies and codify the current benefit through two (2)
modificotions: (1) in the first senience of the first paragraph, reploce “up to one
(1} year at full pay" with “up to sixty (40) calendar days at full pay", and {2}
delete the first sentence in the second paragraph. The County olso seeks to
include an eddilional limitation on the current provision by proposing to delete

the following from the third paragraph — "on an unrestricted/full-duty basis”.

Having reviewed the parties! proposals in conjunction the awarded items
as a whole and the evidence presented in this matter, the policy in Article 34
does not require modification other than coditying the current benefit as
proposed by the County. | award the County's proposal to (1} in the first
sentence of the first paragroph, replace “up to one (1) year at full pay” with “up
to sixty [60) calendar days al full pay”, and (2) delete the first sentence in the

second paragraph.

Other Modifications/Proposals on Economic {ssues not Awarded

As to the remainder of the porties’ modifications and proposals on the
economic issues, including out not limited to the PBA’s proposa's on automatic
step movement upon the contract expiration date, reductions to the Tier 4

contribution rates, and uniform allowance, all of which are benefits that do not

ca)
exist for any other County bargaining unii, and tne County's proposals ta modify
Atiicles 9IE) and 9{F), | thoroughly reviewed and considered their respective
positions. Having examined these items in conjunction with the supporting
evidentiary submissions | do not find sufficient justification to award them in
whole or in part at this time. | find that the improved economic changes that |
have awarded are reasonable and inclusive of what the financial impact of ihe
award should be while also faking inio consideration that the County's overall
financial obligations include having te fund the economic terms of all of its 21
bargaining units. The remaining modifications and proposais on the economic

issues are therefore rejected.

NON-ECONOMIC ISSUES

Vacation Leave - Article 14

Article 14 establishes vacation day entitlement based upon a requisite

number of years of service. The last sentence af Article 14 provides:

Bidding for vacations shall be based upon Civil Service
senictily, provided it does not create a shortage of
experienced Officers on a given shift.

The PBA proposes to eliminaie the sentence above and replace it with

the following:

42
Vacation time requests shall be awarded based upon
Departmental Seniarity. Vacation time off requests shall be
made within the first thirty (30) days of each calendar year
after the rebid shift change occurs and the new seniarity
schedules are implemented, and approval and/ar denial of
all requests shall be made within fifteen {15} days thereofter.
After completion of the initial thirty (30) day request period,
any requests for days off will be on a first come first serve
basis.

The County is amenable to including a modified version of the language
above as long as (1) the superior aificers have 30 days to respond to the
vacation requests and {2} the sentence that the PBA seeks to eliminaie remains
in place. Tne County submis that the elimination of tne relevant sentence

“could endanger every working C.O. on a parlicular shift, and of course the

inmates.” [County Brie, p. $8]

The evidence shows that a memorialization of the use af seniorily for the
purposes of requesting vacation would mutually benefit the parties, but it does
not establish that the sentence that the PBA seeks la eliminate is necessary or
best serves the public's interest. | award tne follawing language lo be added io

Atticle 14:

Vacalion time requests shall be awarded based upon
Departmental Seniority. Vacation time off requests shall be
made within the first thirty (30) days of each calendar year
after the rebid shift change occurs and the new seniarily
schedules ore implemented. and approval and/ar denial of
all requests shall be made within thirty {30) days thereafter.
After campletion of the initial thirly (30) day request period,

4B
any requests tor days off will be on a first come fist serve
basis,

Seniority ~ Article 27

Arlicle 27 ~ Seniority provides:

A. Seniorily shall be defined os an employee's
length of unbroken continuous service with the Department
of Corrections. Seniarity shall commence and begin to
accumulate from the employee's first day of appointment by
Ocean County as a duly sworn Correction Officer as
recegnized by Civil Service standards and accordingly by
any break in service.

B. The seniority system shall be administered
deportmentally. An employee will carry his/her seniovity from
one section, division ar unit of the department fo another.
Employees will not lose seniority rights if transferred from one
title or duly assignment fo another within the same rank.

C. The Warden shall hove the authority to designote
employees to a sixty (60} day troining period when filing a
new position wiihin the Deportment of Corrections.

D. The Warden sholl, regardiess of accumulated
seniority of employee (s) in question, have the authority to
make emergency transfers to positions where needed for a
period not to exceed ninety {90} days

a Officers shall have the sight to bid for their shift as
well as days off, when transfered into the division. The
Warden shall retain the sole autharity for Ihe assignment of
Officers to sections, divisions or units within the Department.

44
The PBA proposes to create new Sections B and C and to re-designate

the existing sections. The PBA's proposals provide:

8. The County shall implement and maintain a shift selection
and days off annual bidding process wiih the following
provisions being followed:

1. The employer shall post a seniority list by October 18 of the
preceding year.

2. Seniority bidding shall commence November 1:!.

3. The new schedule shall be posted by November 7" based
upon the bids that have been awarded,

4, The new schedule, which is the resull of the seniority
bidding process, shall be effective the first full week of
January.

5. The employer shall have the tight to deviate from the
procedure in special needs circumstances, including but
not limited to ensuring appropriate staffing levels and
ensuring that at least one female officer is working each
shift.

4. The parlies agree that there is one seniority list regardless
of gender.

7, No individual shall be denied their seniority selection due
to discrimination.

C. Upon the completian of the annual bidding process each
Officer assigned ta the Security Unit, on their respective shift,
will have the right fo bid for their working post{sj for each of
their five (5) working days. The bidding of posts will be done in
accordance with Deparimental Seniority on said shifts.

1. Center Contral- Officers assigned to Center Conirol will be

Securily Unit may re-did their post assignment(s) in
accordance wilh above mentioned process. Officers will

The PBA's brief includes ratianale for this proposal:

Finally, one of the most imporlan? praposals put farh by
P.B.A. #258 seeks to modify Article 27 entitied “Seniority.” To
this end, P.B.A, #258's proposal seeks to coaify the shill and
past bidding process thet have been adhered ta by the
parties for ihe past several years. For the Arbiiratar's
‘eference, shift bidding periains fo the shift a member works,
such as 7:00 a.m. to 3:00 p.m., whereas pos! bidding refers ta
the specific assignment o member works during his/her shift,
such as being assigned to a tower or a cerlain detention
area

By way of background, in 2014. the then-Warden af the
Ocean County Depcrimeni of Corrections, Theodore Hutler,
executed an agreement with P.8.A. #258 referred to as the
“Three Year Rule.” (Exhibit PBA-1-27). The agreement expressly
provided far shift and post bidding for P.B.A. #258 members
and was effective for the 2015 and 2016 calendar years.
(1T65:3-4}. The first section of the agreement outlined the units
and/or assignments the Warden retained ihe unfettered right
to assign members ta, irrespective of the posi bidding
process. {1163:22-64: Nevertheless, these unils and/or
assignments were subject io the shitt bidding process, thereby

  

46
allowing P.B.A. #258 members fo bid upon the specific shiff
they would work. Ibid.

The second seclion of the “Three Year Rule" provided
post bidaing rights for those members assigned to the Security
Division (Exhibit PBA-1-27; 1164:2-11]. For clarity, the Security
Division contains multiple posts, ta include ihase directly
supervising inmates, relief assignmenis, and roving patrol
assignments. Ibid. To this end, this section of the agreement
allowed P.B.A. #258 members to bid upon their respective
posts and/or assignments based upon seniarity. (1T64:8-11}.

As explained by President Woods, the agreement was
entitled the “Three Year Rule" because any member who
possessed less than three [3] years with the Ocean Counly
Department of Carrections was nat eligiple to engage in the
post bidding process:

Q. And this particular agreement, Luke, was calied the
Three-Year Rule and | think the warden labeled that
because it lasted for three years; is that correct?

A. No, that was filled because of any officer that
didn't have...three years within tne department
wouldn't have the righi io bid for the posi inside the
security unit, although the afficers in charge allowed
them to bid. They also—they understood that they were
subject to being replaced or being moved ta a
different post at will and anyone that had three years
or more within a department would be placed—would
choose their post and noi be able to be moved from
their post.

(1764:12-65:2.]

Upon expiratian of the “Three Year Rule” Agreement, a
subsequent agreement was reached belween P.B-A. #258
and now-Warden Mueller. (1165:7-10). This agreement was
colloquially refered to as “The Five-Year Rule" Agreement.
(Exhibit PBA-1-28; 1766:7-9). This subsequent agreement. in
essence, continued the shift and past bidding processes and
benefits contained in the “Three Year Rule" Agreement for
2016 through fhe expiration of the instant collective
negotialions agreement. {1165:16-66:2}. However, the name

47
of the agreement was changed to ihe "Five Year Rute”
because the P.B.A. #258 membership was gelling a bit cider
and, thus, the post bidding process would only be available
to those members who possessed five (5} years with fhe
Department, as opposed to three {3} years in the prior
agreement. {1766:7-14).

The “Five Year Rule” Agreement also slightly modified
the units and/or assignments the Warden retained discretion
over and tne units and/or assignments that were subject to
ine pest bidding pracess, {1186:15-25). Nevertneless, the “Five
Year Rule" Agreement continued the bidding pracess for cll
open assignments. Ibid. The Agreement also allowed a “re-
bid" halfway through the year so as fo allow members to
chonge posis and/or assignments, if they so desired. Ibid,
Outside of these minor modifications, everything ‘rom the
“Three Year Rule" Agreement remained the same. This was
concisely explained by President Waods:

This agreement which we come te os we called it the—
we ended up changing it to the Five-Year Rule and the
reasan we changed it to five yeors is the department
was getting a little bil older ond we didn't—so snyone
with less than five years would be subject to removal
from their post that they bid for within security and
anyone with more than five years would net.

With that we also changed—came to an agreement
on what units the warden could place officers in based
upon deparimental seniority. We continued Ihe re-
bidding of any apen assignment posts. We allowed io
do a past re-bid haifway through the year, so if officers
wanted ta and could, you know based upon their
seniority. they could change their posi halfway through
the year. Thot was basically it. Like | said, everything
else was the same,

(1166:7-25.]

The shift and post bidding provided in the “five Year
Rule” Agreement was continued through ihe expiration of the
Collective negotiations agreement on June 30, 2019.
Accarding to President Woods, the Agreement is being
followed at the current time. (\167:13-68:3). To Ihis end, each

48
and every component of the Agreement is being followed
wilh the exception of post bidding. Ibid. However, Warden
Mueller has deferred to the respective Officers in Chorge of
each shift as to whether to offer post bidding. Ibid. Of the
three (3) shifts available, Iwo (2) of the Officers in Charge
have allowed the post bidding to continue. Ibid, The final
Officer in Charge has not pul the respective posts for bidding.
but the post assignments that were awarded based upon the
las? bidding process have remained in place. Ibid, in other
words, here has not yet been a need to pul the assignments
up for bidding 0s of yet

In its proposal, P.B.A. #258 seeks io codify the "Five Year
Ruie” into the collective negotiations agreement, thereby
preserving the shit and posi bidding processes that have
been followed for the past five {5} years. (1T68:8-12).
Moreover, the proposol seeks to institute certain deadlines as
to when the respective bidding processes will commence
and when ihe shifts and/or posts will be awarded.

While recognizing the Warden and, by extension, the
Caunty retains great discretion as te assigning ceriain
individuals to certain posts and/or assignments, the shift and
posi bidding processes are of vital importance fo the P.B.A.
#258 membership. Specifically, these bidding processes
promote stability in members’ personal lives as well as boost
their moraie in getting io work a shift, post, ar assignment
which they desire, This was detailed by Presiden! Waads
during the caurse of his direct testimony:

@. How impartant, Luke, is it to your members to have
the ability to bid for their shifts, their days off, as well as
their pasts?

A. | mean the shifis and days off. ! mean that's jusi—
that's obvious you know. You want to get the best shift
and the best days off that work for you and your
family...if just boosts morale for the post bidding within
the department.

You're stuck within the confines of the jail. II's nice to

be able to wark whether it's the same pest every day
or the same past with the same partner every day or

49
just the posi that you want to be working al as
opposed fo being told that you hove to work there.

[1768:19-69:6.)

President Woods olso detoiled the importance of the
continuity that shift and post bidding provides in maintaining
the security of the correctionol facility:

Q. And as far as the octual security in running the jail,
‘Luke, with continuity of individuals working at the some
post is that important as well?

A. Absolutely. The biggest thing wiih—goes bock to
dealing with inmates. Inmates are on a schedule within
the facility and that schedule works because the
inmates know what to do, when to do it, eat when to
ect, sleep when to sieep, so it works for them. And in
turn, it goes some for the officers because we're in
there just os much as they ore, so to allow us to have
ihat continuity of being in the same spot or the same—
on the same post or doing the same job with the same
people every day, it makes your day go better and |
think it gets you a better officer out of if. And that all
came abou! when the new jail was designed.

Warden Hutler had come Up with a policy that officers
hod to work the same post five days a week and then
that was done by seniority, not as an agreemeni, but
thai's what he wanted because he wanted the
continuily cf the same officer being in the same unit
because il's ihe same inmates day in and day oui and
so the unil should run the same if it’s the same officer
day in and day out which means you'll nave tess
problems.

(1189:7-70:7.]

Lastly, President Woods explained how the shift and
post bidding processes ensure that officers get to know the
inmates they are responsible for in their particular unit and/or
assignment, thereby furthering security and stability in the
facility as well:

50
@. And os far as the officers having the ability to
actually know the inmates that are housed within their
unit with the post tha? they work, how imporiant is thet
fo safely ond security as well?

A. It's very important because if you work with the
same inmate every day you may know an inmate, just
their attitude. Knowing who the inmate is and how to
deal with the inmate because you work there day in
and day out makes it, one, makes it easier to work in
the unit, but two, makes it sofer becouse one inmate
moy work a uni! five days a week and know that
inmate so-and-so tends io gel heated over a game of
cards. And | understand that if’s not an argument; it's
just how he expresses himself. But if it’s someone
different every day, that person may not understand
that and see thot inmate get healed ond possibly think
thai there's semething starling to happen. Then the
officer could possibly get involved which then could
lead into a bunch of different scenarios.

So if you have the same person there, you know, ond
typically when we bid for our posts the mast senior guys
are bidding the same post five days a week.
Sometimes it's three doys here, two days there as a
break, but being thal i's done by seniority, they
typically choose the same spot every day so they have
that continuity.

[11708-71:9.]

in opposition to the proposal, the County elicited
jestimony from Warden Mueller and Deputy Warden Valenti
indicating that the Deportment and, more specifically,
Officers in Charge must maintain discretion to assign officers
to posts they deem appropriate given each officer's unique
set of skills, strengths, and/or weakness. {17153:13-154:19; 202:
Moreover, the Counly seems to argue thal this discretion must
be maintained in light of lhe changes to the correctional
facility on account of bail reform, nomely the decrease in the
inmate population. Thus, according to the County, the
Deparlment must be provided the abilify to assign officers 1o
different pos!s when certain posts needs fo be closed and/or
callapsed on account of the population fluctuation.

51
The County's arguments in opposition to the proposal
are somewhat hollow. First, ii is undisputed that the County
and/or Department have been abiding by either the "Three-
Year Rule” or “Five-Year Rule” Agreemenis for Ihe past five (5)
years. Thus, any assertion that the implementation of shifl and
post bidding processes contained in the agreemenis have a
detrimental impact upon the safety and security of the
correctional facility are without merit. Simply put, if the shift
and post bidding selection processes had an adverse impoct
‘on safely and/or security, the “Three-Year Rule” Agreement
would not have been, in essence, renéwed through
implementation of the “Five-Yeor Rule” Agreement. Further,
os detailed by President Woods, utilizotion of the shift and
post bidding processes aciually enhonced sofely and
security at the facility, nol compromised it-

Additionally, cognizant of the Department's need to
close certoin posts and/or assignments on occasion,
President Wooas testified thot the reassignment of mernbers
in such circumstances hos been accepted by P.B.A. #258
ang, thus, would not constitute a violation of this language if
the proposal is ullimately awarded:

Q. And ff they [P.B.A. #258 members] have bid on a
particular posi and the County is maving them
someplace else, in effect fhe County would be in
violation of the contract, wouldn't they?

A, No, there's an understanding thot if o post closed—
we've already had this incident, Ihat if a post closed
the officer understands that he's not going to be in that
post, or by selecling a post there may be the—
because of projects going on within the jail that he
may be reassigned to a different sost or as an extra
because his post is now vacant.

[17113:9-20.]
Warden Mueller confirmed this understanding during
her cross-examination and expressly indicated that the shiff

and post bidding processes being utilized, subject to
reassignments being necessitated due to the closure of

52
certain posts, have not resulted in any issues in running the
focifity:

Q. And you were here when Officer Woods testified,
conmect?

A. Yes.

@. And Officer Woods, you heard him state that the
PBA had no issues with officers being moved during —
due to the fact that pasts were being closed, correct?

A. Correct...

@. And you testified that you have two OCs [Officers
in Charge] that are still currently following the Five-Year
Rule?

A. They're allowing people fo bid for their post, but
then they have the authorily as OIC to move people
around as they see fit regardless of where the person
bid.

Q. And given that they're still implementing and
following the Five-Year Rule since | guess you believe it
expired at the end of June, | take il there haven't been
ony issues with it thus fare

A. There haven't been any issues because when
officers needs to be deployed or redepioyed it can
happen.

[1T358:8-1 60:4.)

Lastly, ine County seems io take the position thot P.B.A.
#258's proposal in its cument form seems to allow P.8.A. #258
members to bid on Iheir posts and/or assignment each and
every day. (1T202:3-8}. This is not the intention of the proposal.
Instead, the proposal allows members to bid for the post
and/or assignment they would work five (5) days a week, not
allow © bid for each post each and every day. Such an
aperoach would be nonsensical and daes nat accurately
teflect what is being sought by P.B.A. #258 as referenced in
President Woods’ testimony.

53
After reviewing the reasoning behind the proposal and
acknowledging the fact that shift and post bidding has been
utilized by the Department for the past five (5} years, P.B.A.
#258's propesal must be owarded. Quite simply, codification
of the shift and post bidding processes is necessitated to
ensure this benefit is preserved jor P.8.A. #258 members going
forward. Additionally, the award of this proposal furthers
continuity in the operation of the correctional facility. thereby
fostering safety and security for not only P.B.A. #258 members,
but inmates and civilian personnel as well. [PBA Brief, pp. 104-
2].

The Counly is not opposed ie the inclusion of porlions of the PBA's
proposal as it applies to shift bidding and time aff, but it rejects the remainder of
the PBA's proposal far operational reasons and contends that it infringes upon

the County's managerial rights:

‘The PBA has proposed to revamp the seniority article of
the CBA. The County agrees that seniority as it applies to shift
bidding and time off should control, and in fact, it does.
Moreover, the procedural aspects of seniority also are
appropriate for inclusion in o CBA. {Section 8 (1). (2), (3} and
(4}). However, the County strongly disagrees tha seniority
should control with regard to assignments. Section 8 (5) and
C (i), (2) and {3} do exactly that.

The Department has been very fair about assignments.
First, Warden Hutler entered inio the "3-Year Rule" with the PBA.
regarding assignments. Second, Warden Mueller entered inlo
the "5-Year Rule" with the PBA. Both the "3-Year Rule” and the
"5-Year Rule" [sunsetied} on the last day of the agreements.
Warden Mueller did not review the "5-Year Rule” because of
the dramatic change in the operations of the correction
facilifies due to the Ball Reform Act.

On cross-examination, C.O. Woods admitted that there
has been a dramatic change in operations because of Bail

54
Reform. Woods conceded tha! dye to the decline in inmate
population, posits are frequently closed and the assigned
C.O.'s have to be re-assigned. {Ir 104:6 - 107:1).

Warden Mueller explained thai the bidding an
assignments provided by the "5-Year Rule” no longer worked
because Bail Reform has caused so many changes in a short
span of fime. At one point, six {4) units in the jail were closed
(Tr. 140: 6-19]. Mueller explained that re-assignments had to
be made based upon the skills needed for the assignment.
The Warden relies on the judgement of the OIC [Officer in
Charge) to make the appropriate reassignment. Moreover,
she explained the assignments can be very different even
though they are allin the same facility. (Tr. 140:15 - 143:24).

Since of the "5-Year Rule" has expired, Iwo (2} out of the
three (3) OIC's have continued to allow their C.0.'s to bid
their posis with the undersianding that if the post is closed,
ihe officer will be reassigned. {Tr. 143:22 - 14:12). Mueller
stated that the elimination of the "S-Year Rule” has noi had a
negative impact. (Tr. 144:13-16). At the conclusion of her
testimony, Warden Mueller emphasized the imporlance of
having the flexibility and discretion io reassign C.0.'s lo those
posts where they were the"... righ! king of officer or the right
kind af skills and abilities ... everybody is just nat acrass the
board the same kind of personality when if comes to dealing
with inmates." {Tr. 145: 5-20}.

Deputy Warden Valenti corroborated = Muetler’s
testimony and even went info greater detail regarding the
difference in the assignmenis (Ir. 179 - 184:13). Valenti
explained the difference between shift bidding and bidding
on posts, or in other words, assignments (Tr. 206:20 - 210:11}
The Deputy Warden specifically said he supports shift bidding.
(Tr. 210:12-14]. However, he oppased past bidding. When
asked on cross if ihere were any issues with post bidding,
Volenti gave specific exampies of C.O.'s balking at
reassignments different than their bidded post. (Tr. 208: 23 -
210:13).

Officer Weoas insinuated in his testimany that if the PBA
Senioriiy Proposal was awarded and C.©.'s had to be
reassigned, the PBA would not have a problem with the PBA.
(Tr. 107:3-15). Unfortunately, doing that would be in vialatian

55
of Proposal Number 2. Seniority and the County would likely
be in grievance arbitration. There is a reason why the County
hos proposed “looser pays” in the County's grievance
arbitration proposal.

Finally, and probably most importantly. the low does
not support the PBA’s proposal. The Public Employment
Commission has ruled for years hat tne employer has a nen-
negotiable prerogative to assign employees to meet ihe
governmental policy goa) of matching the best qualified
employees to particular jobs. New Jersey Transit Corp. v. PBA
Locol 304, 32 NIPER 142, 2006 West Law 6824445 (Oct. 26,
2006}{PERC restrained arbitration, helding that “arbitrator may
net secand-guess the police chief's determination that two
officers were best suited for undercover assignments."};
Somerset County Sherifi's Otfice v. Corr. Officers' PBA Local

resircined arbitration relating to Sheriff's refusal to consider a

holding that permilting him to fil 7his position would
“supstantially limit tne Sheriffs ability to ceplay the more

rank and experience can better be used."}, Burlington

representotives may agree ihat seniority can be a faciar in
shifl selection where all qualifications are equal, managericl
prerogalives are not otherwise compromised. and. the
employer retains the right to deviate from the procedures
where necessary ‘¢ accomplish a governmental policy goal.
Caunty of Hudsor_y. PBA Local 109A, 42 NJPER 32, 2015 West
Law 5604425 [Aug. 13, 2015} (finding that clause in Agreement
“was not mandatorily negotiable because } appears to
mandate that shift assignments be based solely on seniority
and does not appear to preserve management’ s right to

 

 

56
deviate from a seniority shift assignment system lo accomplish
its governmental policy goals.”}.

In conclusion, besides the law being very clear
regarding this proposal, the PBA has not demonsiraied a
need for it. C.O. Woods and Warden Mueller both testified
that the County has prudently exercised its discretion
regarding assignments. Therefore, given the dramatic

chonges in operations due to the Bail Reform Act, this
proposal should be rejected. [County srief, pp. 58-61].

Having considered the parties’ arguments in conjunction with the
evidence presented in support of their respective positions, | award the PBA’s
proposals to creale and include new Section B{]}-(4), but | conclude that the
PBA has met ils burden to prove that the remainder of the proposal reauires

implementation ai this time.

Agency Shop Provision - Ariicle 28

The current Agreement! includes an agency shop provision. The County's
proposes fo eliminate this provision. The PBA did not expressly address the merits
of the County's propesal in its post-hearing brief. Agency shop fees are now
illegal pursuant Janus v, AFSMCE, Council 31, ef al, 585 U.S. (2028). Put
simply, the provision is Inconsistent with prevailing law. | award the elimination of

this provision while adding new language in its place as follows:

57
The parties recognize and shall be guided by the terms of the
Workplace Democracy Enhancement Act as set forth in
NSA. 34:134-5.11,

Other Modifications/Proposals on Non-Economic !ssues not Awarded

As to the remainder of the parties’ modifications and proposals on the
non-economic. issues, including but net limited to the PBA’s proposal on
emplayce rights which seeks the incorporation of select areas of prevailing law,
and the County's proposals with respect fo Article 6 — Uniform Maintenance
Allowance and Article 2) — Grievance Procedure, | thoroughly reviewed and
considered their respective positions. Having examined these items in
conjunction with the supporting evidentiary submissions | do not fiad sufficient

justification to award them in whole or in part and, therefore, are rejecied.

CONCLUSION

i conclude that the terms of this Award represent a reasonable
determination of the issues after applying the statutory criteria, | have weighea
ine statutory factors as more fully discussed above and conclude there is
nothing in the record that compels a different resutt than | have determined in

this proceeding.
