A-16(e) (1). This statutory provision requires that an
award be issued within 45 days of my appointment. By letter of
August 12, I scheduled an interest arbitration hearing for

September 5, 2013 and directed each party to submit a final

 

offer no later than August 22 in accordance with N.J.S.A.

34:13A-16(£) (1

 

On September 5, I conducted an interest arbitration hearing
at the County Administration Building. The County and FOP each
submitted documentary evidence and testimony. Both parties
submitted Final Offers. The FOP submitted a calculation of
the financial impact of their respective economic proposals.

The County offered the testimony of Financial Analyst Vijay

 

ed and totaled

 

Kapoor, a list of unit employees showing det.
costs of base pay, increments, longevity payments, uniform
allowance, and a levy cap calculation worksheet for 2013.
The FOP agreed to the accuracy of the employee list and the
calculations shown therein. Post-hearing summations were filed
by September 13, 2013.
FINAL OFFERS OF THE COUNTY
The County submitted the following final offer:

The County also proposed to freeze step movement on the guide
for the length of the contract. These proposals combined would
have the net effect of requiring most unit employees to
retroactively reimburse the County for step increases already
paid in 2011, 2012, and 2013.

At the hearing, the County amended its Final Offer on the
record to propose that employees would be permitted to keep
salary step increments previously paid (in January 2011, 2012,
and 2013) but to eliminate future salary step movements. The
County also proposed a zero increase in step values for the life
of the contract. Further, it proposed to eliminate contract

language providing for increases in Section 2 and renumber the
remaining sections.?
Article 8: Overtime

Section 4: Emergency Closings - revise language as
follows:

A Storm Day or Emergency requiring the closure of
County offices shall mean only an official declaration
of same made by the Board of Chosen Freeholders or the
County Administrator and shall not include those
declared by the State of New Jersey or those
promulgated by the Warren County Department of Public
Safety, Office of Emergency Management. For purposes
of this Agreement, a Storm Day or Emergency declared
by the Board of Chosen Freeholders or County
Administrator shall be memorialized by memorandum to
be filed with and retained by the Finance Department,
Payroll and shall include starting and ending dates
and times of the closure of County offices.

 

lon-Essential Employees:
Should an employee report for work and subsequently
the Employer decide to officially close the Employer's
offices for any reason, such employees that report to
work shall be credited for the day’s work. Should the
Employer for any reason officially close the
Employer's offices before the start of the workday,
all employees scheduled to work that day will be
credited with a day's work.

 

Essential Employees
Essential employees shall be paid double time for each

hour worked by them during a Storm Day or Emergency
when officially declared by the Board of Chosen
Freeholders or County Administrator. The double time
shall be earned for all hours worked during the entire
period of an officially declared storm or emergency.

 

In its brief, the Employer again proposed salary reductions of 3.75% in
2011 and 2% salary increases in 2012 and 2013 respectively, consistent with
the chart above. To the extent that the Employer is now seeking to amend
its Final Offer again, this amendment is not allowed. N. 34:13A-16
only permits amendments of Final Offers up until the beginning of the
arbitration hearing.

 

 

  
In the event an essential employee cannot report for
work because of storm conditions or emergency
conditions, the time lost from work will be charged
against accumulated vacation or personal leave time.
In the event that no such leave time is available, the
time lost from work will be charged as time off
without pay. If an essential employee is unable to
report to work, the employee must report this absence
no less than one and one-half (1 %) hours before the
starting time of their shift or the start of their
normal workday.

Determination as to which employees are essential and
which are non-essential may vary given the
circumstances of ach event leading o the issuance of
an official declaration of a storm day or emergency.
Department/division heads are given authority to
determine classification of essential and non-
essential employees. At minimum, essential employees
shall always include those necessary to maintain
statutory or code-related mandated minimum staffing
levels at Warren County’s 24-hour institutions/
operations.

Non-Essential and Essential Employees with Previously
Approved Leave of Absenc

 

 

During any officially declared storm day or emergency,
employees absent from work for a previously approved
leave of absence, paid or unpaid, shall remain in such
status. These may include vacation leave, personal
leave, sick leave, workers’ compensation leave,
FMLA/FLA leave, disciplinary leave. In the event that
an essential employee with a previously approved leave
of absence is available to report for work, is called
out by their Department/Division head and does report
for work, such employee shall be paid as described in
this Agreement and the previously approved leave time
shall be credited to the employee’s leave time
balances.

Article 10: Holidays

Section 3: Change as follow:

 

With regard to the scheduling of compensatory days
off, the first through the seventh such days off in

degree relative as defined below. Any remaining
balance of unused bereavement leave days can be
utilized in the case of the death of a first degree
relative or second degree relative as defined below.
With regard to second degree relatives, employees
shall be limited to one (1) bereavement leave day per
ccurrence.

 

2. First degree relatives shall be defined as

which includes employees who have terminated their service since
January 1, 2011 as well as employees who have been hired since
that date, is a realistic measure of costs and should be used to

calculate the costs of the award herein.
BACKGROUND FACTS

Demographics

Warren County is located in the far, northwestern edge of
the State and borders on the Delaware River at the Delaware
River Water Gap. It is bordered by Sussex County to the North,
Morris County to the East and Hunterdon County to the South.
These four counties, in addition to Somerset County, make up the
“skylands Region” of New Jersey.

The historic patterns of development for Warren County have

been established based on the geography of the area and the

   

transportation system. Route 46/Route 80 runs east and
west through the middle of the County. North of Route 46/Route

80 is marked by rugged slopes and relatively shallow soils over
12

bedrock, which discouraged the early development of
transportation, agriculture and economic development. South of
Route 46, broader valleys encouraged development, specifically
for agricultural areas with markets for farm products in the
Newark and New York metropolitan areas. The major population
centers today are Phillipsburg, Hackettstown, Washington and
Belvidere, which is the County seat. (E-2, p.58; E-23)

In the 1960’s there was an increase in development activity
when marginal farms were sold to land developers, particularly
in the northern part of the County. The completion of
Interstate 78 in the 1980’s led to additional housing and
commercial development. The Merrill Creek Reservoir, a 1.1
square mile reservoir built by a consortium of seven regional

electric companies, is now the largest tax-paying entity in the

 

County and includes a 290-acre nature preserve and a visitor's
center that are open to the public. (E-23)

Of the four counties in the northwestern section in the

 

Skylands area, i.e. Morris, Sussex, Warren, and Hunterdon,
(highlighted in the chart below), Warren County has the lowest

population:

In addition, the Employer points out that Warren County's
unemployment rate as projected for June 2013, is 6.9% as
compared with the fourteen counties in northern Jersey of 8.2%
and as compared with the Allentown-Bethlehem-Easton MSA OF 7.8%.
(E-2, p. 58)

The County asserts that Warren County is part of the
Allentown-Bethlehem-Easton Metropolitan Statistical Area (MSA)
and therefore, the Pennsylvania Counties of Northampton, Monroe,
Carbon, Luzerne, and Lackawanna should all be considered as

relevant data for the purposes of comparing cost-of-living,
16

economic data, salaries and benefits. It also seeks comparison
with the fourteen New Jersey counties comprising “North Jersey”.

The Union argues that the Pennsylvania counties are, in
essence, “farm counties”, have no relevance to Warren County for
purposes of analysis, and should be given no weight. The FOP
notes that, pursuant to the “New Jersey First” statute enacted
in 2011, New Jersey public employees are required to maintain
residence in New Jersey. However, the Employer counters that
this same statute grandfathered employees already living in
Pennsylvania at the time of its passage and emphasizes that
about 208 of Warren County employees continue to live in
Pennsylvania. The Union proffers, for purposes of comparison,
the wage and benefit data of correction officers in eighteen of
the twenty-one New Jersey counties where data was available and
contends that this is the fairest and most relevant data for
comparative analysis.

I have considered both parties’ arguments with regard to
this issue. I have assigned little relevance to demographic
data and salary and benefit data for Lackawanna, Luzerne and
Carbon Counties, as these counties are geographically remote
from Warren County. For instance, Hazleton, on the border of
Carbon and Luzerne Counties, is approximately seventy miles from
Belvidere. It is unlikely that Warren County correction

office

 

s would be living in these three remote counties. On the
v7

other hand, I find that southern New Jersey counties (south of
Route 195) may be given only slight weight in considering
comparative data for salaries and benefits. These counties are
also too geographically remote from Warren County and are
certainly not within “commuting distance” for a Warren County
correction officer. I consider the most relevant group for
purposes of comparison to be those counties contiguous to
Warren; that is the New Jersey counties of Sussex, Morris and
Hunterdon, and the two Pennsylvania counties - Monroe and
Northampton. I intend to give greater weight to data from New
Jersey counties, as at least 30% of Warren County's correction
officers both live and work in New Jersey.
Organization of the Department

The Warren County Correctional Center is an adult
correctional facility used to detain adult offenders.
Correction officers are responsible for the safety, welfare, and
control of all inmates and the Correctional Center’s employees.
In July of 2011, the Warren County Board of Chosen Freeholders
assigned the care, custody, and control of the correctional
center to the Warren County Sheriff. The Correctional Center is
under the direct supervision of Warden Robert Brothers, a twenty-
five year veteran of corrections.

Currently the daily population averages between 145 and 155

male and female adult offenders, in addition to 20 adult
18

offenders on the Labor Assistance Program, and up to 6 adults and
6 juvenile offenders on the Electronic Monitoring Program.

The Correctional Center is a podular design and is operated
as both a remote and a direct supervision facility. Inmates are
classified upon entry to determine the level of supervision
that is required. Inmates are housed in minimum, medium, and
maximum security housing areas.

STATUTORY CRITERI:

 

I am required to make a reasonable determination of the

above issues giving due weight to those factors set forth in

 

 

34:13A-16g(1) through (9) that I find relevant to the
resolution of these negotiations. These factors, commonly
called the statutory criteria, are as follows:

(1) The interests and welfare of the public. Among the
items the arbitrator or panel of arbitrators shall
assess when considering this factor are the
limitations imposed upon the employer by (P.L.
1976, c. 68 (C. 40A:4-45.1 et seq.).

(2) Comparison of the wages, salaries, hours, and
conditions of employment of the employees involved
in the arbitration proceedings with the wages,
hours, and conditions of employment of other
employees performing the same or similar services
and with other employees generally:

(a) In private employment in general;
provided, however, each party shall
have the right to submit additional
evidence for the arbitrator's
consideration.

(b) In public employment in general;
provided, however, each party shall
(3)

(6)

19

have the right to submit additional
evidence for the arbitrator's
consideration,

(c) In public employment in the same or
similar comparable jurisdictions, as
determined in accordance with section
5 of P.L. 1995. c. 425 (C.34:13A-16.2)
provided, however, each party shal
have the right to submit additional
evidence concerning the comparability
of jurisdictions for the arbitrator's
consideration.

   

The overall compensation presently received by
the employees, inclusive of direct wages,
salary, vacations, holidays, excused leaves,
insurance and pensions, medical and
hospitalization benefits, and all other economic
benefits received.

Stipulations of the parties.

The lawful authority of the employer. Among the
items the arbitrator or panel of arbitrators
shall assess when considering this factor are
the limitations imposed upon the employer by the
1976 c. 68 (C.40A:4-45 et seq).

 

The financial impact on the governing unit, its
residents and taxpayers. When considering this
factor in a dispute in which the public employer
is a county or a municipality, the arbitrator or
panel of arbitrators shall take into account to
the extent that evidence is introduced, how the
award will affect the municipal or county
purposes element, as the case may be, of the
local property tax; a comparison of the
percentage of the municipal purposes element,

or in the case of a county, the county purposes
element, required to fund the employees’
contract in the preceding local budget year with
that required under the award for the current
local budget year; the impact of the award for
each income sector of the property taxpayers on
the local unit; the impact of the award on the
ability of the governing body to (a) maintain

 
20

existing local programs and services, (b) expand
existing local programs and services for which
public moneys have been designated by the
governing body in a proposed local budget, or
(c) initiate any new programs and services for
which public moneys have been designated by the
governing body in its proposed local budget.

(7) The cost of living.

(8) The continuity and stability of employment
including seniority rights and such other
factors not confined to the foregoing which are
ordinarily or traditionally considered in the
determination of wages, hours and conditions of
employment through collective negotiations and
collective bargaining between the parties in the
public service and in private employment.

(9) Statutory restrictions imposed on the employer.
Among the items the arbitrator or panel of
arbitrators shall assess when considering this
factor are the limitations imposed upon the
employer by section 10 of P.L. 2007, c. 62
(C.40A: 4-45.45).

In arriving at the terms of this award, I conclude that

all of the statutory factors are relevant, but not all are

 

entitled to equal weight. It is widely acknowledged that in
most interest arbitration proceedings, no single factor can be
determinative when fashioning the terms of an award. This
observation is present here as judgments are required as to
which criteria are more significant and as to how the relevant
evidence is to be weighed.

In addition, I note that N.J.S.A. 34:13A-16g(8) requires

consideration of those factors ordinarily or traditionally

considered in the determination of wages, benefits, and
21

employment conditions. One such consideration is that the
party proposing a change in an employment condition bears the
burden of justifying the proposed change. Another
consideration is that any decision to award or deny any
individual issue in dispute, especially those having economic

impact, will include consideration as to the reasonableness of

 

that individual issue in relation to the terms of the entire

 

award. I am also required by statute to determine the total
net annual economic cost of the terms required by the Award.
In this matter, the interests and welfare of the public
must be given the most weight. It is a criterion that
embraces many other factors and recognizes the
interrelationships among all of the statutory criteria. Among
the other factors that interrelate and require the greatest
scrutiny in this proceeding are the financial impact of the
award, the restrictions on the employer by the appropriations
cap and the tax levy caps, the comparison of wages, other
compensation and benefits of Warren County’s correction
officers to other similar jurisdictions, and the cost of living

and the wages and settlements within Warren County's workforce.

 

ANALYSIS

Term of Agreemen

Each party has proposed a three-year agreement to cover
22

the period January 1, 2011 through December 31, 2013.

Accordingly, I award a three-year agreement.

Salaries, Increments, Longevity, Step Guide Revisions:

 

The County has already paid step increases due employees
each January for 2011, 2012, and 2013. The County's offer, as
modified at hearing, is to permit employees who are moving
through the step guide to keep the increment money they have
already been paid and to maintain the existing salary guide from
2010. That is, the County proposes a freeze on the salary guide
with no across-the-board increases for the life of the contract.

The County also offers to increase clothing and maintenance

 

allowance by 2% in each year of the contract. In addition, it
offers to increase longevity pay by 28 in each year of the
contract. Going forward, the County demands that the increment
plan be eliminated and that no employee would receive step
increases in future years beyond contract expiration.

The County argues that Chapter 105, P.L. of 2010,
imposed a 2% cap on arbitration awards for all contracts
expiring on or after January 1, 2011. ‘The County contends
that this statute applied to contracts that expire on or
after the effective date of the law. It asserts that its
2008-2010 contract with the FOP expired on January 1, 2011

and that therefore, the 2% cap on increases to total base
23

 

s

 

salaries applies to this matter ( 34:13A-16.7). It
maintains that the legislature could not have intended that
public employers and unions whose contracts expired at
midnight on December 31, 2010 would not be subject to the
28 cap.

The County argues that the Union’s proposal of 1.5%

increases every six months for the life of the contract is

 

unprecedented during difficult economic times, but is
on top of already paid median salary increases of 22.2%
received by employees progressing through the step guide.
It points out that step movement is part of the overall
compensation package and must be given due weight as part
of the financial impact on the governing body and its tax
payers. It points to Article 7, Section 2, of the parties’
2008-2010 contract requires the arbitrator to consider the
cost of step movements as part of the overall compensation
of these employees and to give due weight to the financial
impact on the County and the taxpayers by virtue of these
costs.

The County asserts that once the cost of step movement
is factored in to the overall compensation package, there
can be no other result but to freeze the pay scale at all

steps for all three years of the contract.
24

The County notes that the step guide was first awarded
by Arbitrator Glasson in 2003 as a way to stem the high
turnover being experienced by the jail in the years
preceding that award. As the Union's witnesses testified,
turnover is now virtually nonexistent. The County
therefore asserts that the elimination of automatic step
movement will have no impact on employee turnover going
forward as wages are stagnant, unemployment is high, and
revenue is declining. Further, the County maintains that
the elimination of the step guide consumed substantially
more than the annual 2% increase in overall compensation
imposed by caps and more than the County offered to this
bargaining unit.

The Employer asserts that it is faced with

uw

   

precedented fiscal challenges and unforgiving levy and
spending caps which are making it extremely difficult for
the County to maintain the same level of services and
employee headcount. It most particularly cites the Warren
Haven Nursing Home with a $4.0 million annual operating
loss as the primary source of its fiscal difficulties.
Despite the County’s efforts to cut taxes to stimulate the
economy, tax rates have actually increased to make up the

shortfall caused by falling property values and shortfalls

in other revenue, More specifically the County avers that
25

the tax levy caps and appropriations cap has greatly
restricted the County's ability to raise revenue via
taxation which in turn has a substantial impact on the
amount of money available for pay raises for correction
officers, or for any other County employee.

The County also cites its costs of pension and health
benefit payments as placing an enormous financial burden on
the County. It notes that the employee contributions as
mandated by Chapter 78 do not result in a windfall to the

County but only reduces the overall costs for health

 

benefits by a small amount. It notes that there is no
provision in N.J.S.A, 34:13A-15 to credit savings from
employee health care contributions to employee salaries.

The Employer argues that, to the extent cost
containment can be achieved through reductions in labor
contracts, that the 2% cap on salaries should be applied
here even if not statutorily mandated. Containing the
growth of overall compensation at or below the 2% level is
the County’s goal, including payment of increments.

The County contends that its correction officers are

already competitively paid as compared with correction

 

officers in other jurisdictions and New Jersey's private
sector employees. The County highlights that the last

contract (2008-2010) awarded correction officers 6.0%
26

annual increases in both 2009 and 2010. It emphasizes that
the median cash compensation of a bargaining member was
$61,633 in 2011, far greater than the median cash
compensation for a New Jersey resident over age 25 with a
high school education. Therefore, the County argues
adoption of its Final Offer would only have a positive
impact on the continuity and stability of employment for
correction officers. The County contends, “In these
difficult economic times, it is difficult to imagine that
correction officers would leave the security of a well-
paying job with extremely good health care and pension
benefits, for another job, whether in the private sector or
the public sector”,

The County argues that the statutory cap restrictions
and the interest and welfare of the public dictate that the
County's offer must be awarded. It notes that Warren
County's fiscal condition has been affected by the national
and state economies, as well as other fiscal pressures. It
also notes that the national unemployment rate, as of July
2013 was 7.4%, while Warren County’s unemployment rate as
of December 2012, was also 7.4%. It adds that the cost of
health care premiums rose nationally by 104.3% over the
past decade and that pension-funding pressures continue to

increase as the “baby boomer generation” requires
7

additional years of benefit payments to be made to more
retirees.

Further, the County points out that its tax revenues
decreased by $1.55 million, or 2.27%, from 2008 to 2012, thus,
straining the County budget. Because Warren County is located
in the Highlands Preservation area, increased development within
the County is severely limited, and in turn, limits the
potential for increased property tax revenues. Also
significantly impacting the County's tax revenues is the fact
that County equalized valuation has declined by 13.18 since
2008. Thus, in order to raise the same amount of tax revenues,
the County has had to increase tax rates. Therefore, in order
to meet expenses, the County has had to resort to using surplus

funds to balance its budget. In 2013, the County has had to use

 

surplus funds to offset its $3.5 million budget gap. It
contends that any increases above and beyond the step increments
already paid will only further add to its budgetary strains and

its ability to provide services at Warren Haven Nursing Home.

 

In summary, the County argues its offer provides a
reasonable and generous compensation package for correction
officers in a weakened economy, given the nature of fiscal
constraints that have been imposed by the County.

The FOP observes that it signed a tentative agreement with

the County in May, 2012 which was then rejected by the Board of
28

Freeholders. The FOP’s final offer before me, in essence,
mirrors that agreement. It seeks a three-year contract, with
split increases of 1.5% to top step only, each January and again
in July, in each year of the contract. It also seeks to roll
the longevity benefit into the contract at top step, effective
with the date of the award. Going forward, it proposes to add
an extra step between step 8 and step 9 of the salary guide and
create a new recruit step of $38,000. The remainder of the
contract would continue as is except for provisions previously
agreed upon between the parties, as noted above.

The FOP argues that the 2012 agreement “struck a careful
balance between capping costs and continuing a stable workforce
in the county correctional facility.” It asserts that awarding
the terms of this agreement would both serve the interests of
the public and the interest of both parties.

The FOP highlights that the County Corrections Department is
an integral part of the law enforcement community within the
County of Warren and beyond. Its multifaceted services
compliment the operations of other law enforcement entitles in
the County, including the transport of inmates, arrests and
execution of warrants, It maintains that the exceptional level
of services provided by the correctional personnel are not
matched by compensation or working conditions. It contends that

these employees work in some of the most difficult and challenging
29

work environments.

It asserts that the integration of services and joint
operations with local jurisdictions dictates that a proper
universe of comparison of salaries and benefits is local
comparison and internal comparison to the Prosecutor’s
detectives and Warren’s corrections superiors. It argues that
the Employer's comparisons are inappropriate, as it relied upon
“farm counties" in a different state and, absent a description
of the workload and nature of service provided by those other
jurisdictions, they should not be given any weight.

The FOP contends that Warren County’s correction officers
rank among the lowest paid of all law enforcement in the
State, It offers a chart, taken from my interest arbitration

award in Hudson County Department of Corrections, I.A. No.

 

2012-46, p. 46. (FOP-E).* This chart depicts the top pay for
correction officers in 18 of the 21 counties. The average top
base pay for correctional officers for 2010, (the last year of
the Warren FOP contract), was $75,429. The FOP maintains that
this is far below the 2010 base salary of Warren County
officers which is $68,836. Further, the FOP argues that the
review of settlement and interest arbitration awards reported

by the New Jersey Public Employment Relations Commission

 

The data comprising this chart included in the Hudson award was provided by
parties to that matter. While the Hudson County parties were bound by the
accuracy of the data, the parties in this matter are not.
30

(E-25) shows that the average salary increase granted in
interest arbitration awards and those units that voluntarily
settled was 2.178. ‘The FOP contends that it is merely requesting
a raise slightly higher than the most recent statewide
averages, considering that these unit employees are underpaid and
rank very low in terms of State averages.

As to comparison with other Warren County law enforcement
units, the FOP points out that the County corrections superior
officers received a 2% across-the-board salary increase and
enjoyed cash in pocket raises between $1,639 to $1,959.
Further, the top step investigator in the Prosecutors Office
received $93,217 in 2012 and received a 2% salary increase to
$95,081 in 2013. The FOP argues that this $1,864 raise is even more
than the annual increases ranging from $1,556 to $1,685 as
proposed by the FOP. It notes that, as testified to by both
President Lovenberg and Vice-President Bowlby, correction
officers perform many of the same duties performed by other law
enforcement officers, including transportation of inmates,
arrests, and execution of warrants. Like other county law
enforcement personnel, they are fully trained in firearms on
an annual basis, must carry firearms while off duty, and wear
protective vests while on duty. Therefore, internal comparisons
with those County law enforcement personnel form the best basis
for comparison of wages and salary increases. The FOP offers

a comparative chart which shows that the top pay for sheriff's
a1

officers in 2011 was $68,556 as compared with correction
officers’ current top pay of $68,386. It also shows that if
the FOP’s raises were awarded together with the roll-in of
longevity, as proposed, their new top pay by the end of the
contract period would $76,753 -- more than $5,300 above that
of sheriff's officers.

It is the position of the FOP that comparisons with the
non-law enforcement personnel should not be given any
significant weight as the best comparisons are with other law
enforcement units commonly situated. Due to the unique
statutory obligation and treatment of police officers under New
Jersey Law, any comparison to private sector employees must
result in a strong justification for significantly higher
compensation to be paid to correction officers. The
distinguishing characteristics of a corrections officer, as
compared with a private sector worker, include: the obligation
to be armed and to act in the event of a crime while off-duty at
all times and anywhere in New Jersey; the absence of portability
of one’s pension and job skills to other areas of the country;
the inherent hazardous nature of the work environment; the
application of different standards under the Fair Labor
Standards Act for the treatment of overtime; the absence
of coverage under the New Jersey State Wage and Hour Law;

corrections departments are regulated by specific statutorily
32

set rules and regulations, powers and duties, and the
delegation of authority; qualifications for employment are
statutorily mandated and include citizenship, New Jersey
residency, minimum and maximum age and fitness requirements, and
a clean criminal history record; the mandatory retirement age is
65; employment may be forfeited after five days absence without
just cause; promotional examinations are statutorily required
for certain classes of corrections officers; hiring criteria
and order of preference is set by statute; and corrections
officer pensions are not covered by the federal ERISA Pension
Protection Act. Further, correction officers are subject to
unique, statutorily created hearing procedures for disciplinary
charges; they must undergo basic training at the Corrections
Academy and must regularly re-qualify in firearms; they are
required to wear protective vests at all times while on duty:
and most importantly, they have an obligation to act as a law
enforcement officer at all times of the day, both on and off-
duty, including full arrest powers while off duty anywhere in
New Jersey.

The FOP contends that the greatest weight must be given to
the comparison of the employees in this dispute with other
employees performing the same or similar services and with
other employees generally in public employment in the same or

similar, comparable jurisdictions. The FOP asserts,
33

Correcticns officers are a local labor market
occupation. The farther from the locality, the weaker
the validity of the comparison. Corrections
comparisons are strongest in the local area, such as
contiguous towns, a county, an obvious geographic area
such as the shore or a metropolitan area.
The FOP argues that such a comparison shows that Warren County's
correction officers are comparatively underpaid and below
average and therefore, awarding of its proposal is necessary to
bring these up to average pay for the area.
The FOP calculates that the cost of requested salary

increases for the three-year award would be as follows:

2011: 12 top-step officers x $1,556 = $18,672
2012: 14 top-step officers x $1,634 = $22,876
2013: 18 top-step officers x $1,685 = $30,330

These amounts take into consideration the FOP's proposed roll-in
of longevity into base salary in 2012 in the amount of $1,400.
The FOP notes that the cost of a 1.5% split raise is
significantly less than a flat percentage tobe applied in the
beginning of the year due to the salary increases being
gradually faced in. For instance, in 2011, the total yearly
cost per member would be $1,032 in the first half of the year and
$524 in the second half of the year, for a grand total of
$1,556. The FOP argues that this compares to the corrections
superior officers who received 2% across-the-board salary

increases in 2011, 2012 and 2013. A corrections sergeant, the
34

employee most closely related to a top-pay correction officer,
received $1,636 in 2011, $1,639 in 2012 and $1,671 in 2013.

Accordingly the salary increases for sergeants was almost
identical to that proposed by the FOP here. Additionally, the
Prosecutors detectives received a $1,864 increase in 2013 --
more than what is being proposed by the FOP in this matter.
In addition, the FOP observes that the sheriffs’ officers
received a 2% increase across the board in all steps.

The FOP argues that the County has the ability to pay
the salary increases demanded here. It notes that County
Financial Officer Charles Houck testified that there was
plenty of flexibility in the current budget to allow for a
salary increase to be awarded to correctional officers.
In particular, the overall Corrections budget for salaries
has increased from 2011 to 2013 in the following amounts:
$5,236,864 in 2011, $5,380,121 in 2012, and $5,389,534 in 2013.
While these were the appropriated amounts, the County did not
have to use the full amount appropriated and only paid
$5,017,745 in 2012 and $4,994,915 in 2011 which resulted in
salary surpluses of $362,375 in 2012 and a $241,948 surplus in
2011. (E-16)

Further, the FOP emphasis that, according to Houck, it will

be very likely, absent an extraordinary emergency, that there
would again be a reserve or surplus in 2013. The total costs

for corrections’ salaries declined from 2010 to 2013 from
35

$3,734,841 in 2012 to $3,560,029 in 2013. W-3) Accordingly,
the County will spend $174,812 less in the cost of salaries for
2013 even though it appropriated more money in 2013 for such
salaries.

The FOP argues that, the County has already determined that
it has an ability to pay the salary increase as proposed by the
FOP when it reached an agreement with the FOP on May 7, 2012 to
afford split 1.5% increases in January and July of the years
2011, 2012 and 2013. (FOP-A)

Further, the FOP notes that the County has reduced its tax
levy for 2009, 2010 and 2011. As indicated by the County
Financial Analyst Dan Olfshefski, Warren County has the
lowest amount of debt in any County of the State.

As to the cost of living, the FOP argues that these
correction officers are at Tier 3 of health care
contributions and therefore are contributing 21.75% of
premiums for single coverage and 14.25% for family
coverage this year. In addition, Chapter 78 raised the
pension contribution for FOP unit members from 8.5% of
salary to 10% of salary. Such contributions mark a
significant reduction in take home pay for corrections
officers.

As to the factor of internal comparability, the FOP argues
that this factor that is not only specifically addressed in

the statutory criteria N.J.S.A. 34:13a-16g (2) (c) but also has
36

been found to fall within the criteria of the interest and
welfare of the public in the continuity and stability of
employment. The Public Employment Relations Commission has
recognized the importance of considering internal comparability
and its controlling case law on interest arbitration. The
arbitrator should give considerable weight to both internal
and external comparisons. Comparing the wages and benefits of

this bargaining ur

 

with other correctional groups State-wide
shows that Warren County is significantly underpaid and
below average.
Budget

The County’s budget message for 2013 (E-18) states that
declining revenue in all areas of their budget has increased
financial strain on the County. It goes on to state that Warren
County has the distinction of being located in the middle of the
Highlands Preservation and Planning area. This distinction has
the impact of nearly zero economic growth for the County and in
addition, severely hinders the County’s potential for
development that could improve its declining revenue sources.

The Board of Freeholders has a 2013 budget that addresses
past surplus spending, pays for current services, and plans for
the future without requiring more money from the taxpayers of
Warren County. The 2013 operating budget, exclusive of State

and federal grant-funded appropriations and capital improvement
37

projects, increased 0.3% or $300,000 from the prior year budget.
(B-18)

The County has attempted to ease its tax burdens while
maintaining critical services through the use of County surplus
funds; and without significantly reducing comparable expenses.
According to the Budget Message, the County has a current budget
deficit of more than $3.5 million dollars along with a reduced,
non-recurring savings account. (E-18)

The most significant impact to Warren County’s revenues is
due to reduced revenue receipts for the County-owned nursing
home, Warren Haven. Because of reductions in Medicare/Medicaid
reimbursement rates, revenues have decreased $3.5 million and
Warren Haven, therefore has a current overall budget deficit of
$2.4 million. Also, according to Warren County’s Chief
Financial Officer, Charles Houck, the State has decreased the
per-diem reimbursement rate for Warren Haven patients, thereby
compounding the effect of the revenue loss. Local revenues and
State Aid are down 2.2% and 3.3% respectively. The County
indicates that the State has increased the County’s cost share
for residents in State mental institutions from 10%-15%, a 50%
increase in cost. (E-18) County Budget Analyst Dan Olshefsky
testified that Warren Haven was most recently operating at an

annual loss rate of $4.0 million.
38

Houck testified that in preparing its budget, the County
cannot anticipate more in revenue than it actually received in
the prior year. Anticipated revenues for 2013 and Anticipated

and Realized revenues in 2012 are as follows:

39

The Warren County Board of Freeholders has implemented the
following initiatives to increase the County’s surplus, reduce
costs, and ease the burden on the taxpayer: (E-18; FOP-C)

- Lowering Open Space Tax from 6 cents to 4.5 cents resulting
in more than $1.7 million in reduced taxes for the County.
Board Freeholder Sarnoski states that this reduction
represents less than what has been spent on average over
the past five years and the County will still be building a
surplus in the account.

- Simultaneously collecting more for open space, farmland
preservation, and historical projects than the County has
spent on average in the last five years; and resulting in
an increased surplus in that fund by the end of 2013.

- Warren County Library Tax is not changing from 2012;
however, the opening of its new Headquarters Branch will
allow for the reduction of future costs of the library
system. Sarnoski stated that the County has seen reduced
costs in the terms of building facilities in the future as
changes have been made in usage and occupation of County
facilities.

- Instituted a “Pay As You Go” philosophy resulting in the

lowest debt of any county in New Jersey.
40

- Adopted a resolution requiring voter approval of bond debt
under certain circumstances, providing the taxpayer with
more control in the County’s spending.
- Allocated planning dollars to save for future capital
projects and capital improvements resulting in the county
moving out of deficient buildings with costly leases.
Sarnoski contends that capital projects programs are going
strong and will not require borrowing. (FOP-C; E-18)
County fiscal operations generated approximately $7.0
million in surplus revenues during 2012. Approximately $7.6
million of these funds will be utilized to balance the 2013
budget. Further, $1.1 million additional monies from the
medical trust fund will be utilized in the 2013 budget. (E-18)

Miscellaneous revenues fund 27% of the appropriations in
the 2013 operating budget. These funds decreased by $1,234,000
from the 2012 budget year. The primary source for anticipated
reduced revenues is the Warren Haven Nursing Home operation.
The fee revenue collected from the various County departments
during 2013 is not expected to increase. (E-18)

With regard to the appropriation expense side of the 2013
budget, the County has maintained operating expenses for general
government services and also reduced the size of its government.

The County states that the anticipated costs of general services
a

for 2013 is down 2.2%, public safety expenses have been reduced
by 1.2%, and its human services expenses have been reduced by
7.2%. Even with these savings, statutory and other expenses
have risen over the last year and diminished some the savings
realized. The County’s cost of insurances for budget year 2013
is up 3.8%, and utility costs have risen 2.6%. (E-18)

Personnel costs (salaries and wages) for the 2013 budget,
account for approximately 36.8% of the combined operating budget
appropriations. The Warren County Corrections’ salary budget
for 2013 ($5,389,534), represents 13.7% of the total County’s

salaries budget ($39,326,660).

 

The Board implemented a hiring freeze policy during 2008

through 2012, in which only essential vacant positions were
42

filled. (E-16; E-18) In 2011, the County appropriated
$5,236,884 for salaries and wages in the County Jail but paid
$4,994,915, leaving $241,949 in reserves. In 2012, the County
appropriated $5,380,121 for salaries and wages and paid
$5,017,746, leaving $362,375 in reserve monies for the

correction officer’s salaries. (E-16; E-18) Houck testified

 

that, absent an emergent circumstance, he not envision any

significant change in the reserve balances for the jail salaries

 

account for 2013.

In the 2013 budget, total County salaries and wage
appropriations increased $420,000 (1.0%) from the 2012 budget
year.

Expenditures for employer pension and Social Security
contributions in 2013 increased modestly $38,000 (0.48%)
primarily due to increases in the cost of mandatory
contributions for the New Jersey Public Employees’ Retirement
System (PERS) and payroll tax relating to wages. (E-18)

Warren County provides medical insurance coverage for its
eligible full-time and retired employees and their eligible
dependents through the New Jersey State Health Benefits Plan.
Yearly the plan establishes monthly premiums for each class of
single; husband and wife; parent and

employee coverage, i.e

  

dependent; and family coverage. The County is billed monthly

for the cost of the coverage provided by the plan for the
43

individual employees, based on the level of coverage provided.
Employees are required to contribute a percentage of their gross
wages toward the cost of the coverage. (E-18)

Warren County illustrates the cost of providing this

benefit below: (E-18)

Net Benefit Cost 13,778,911 | 14,830,400 | 1,051,489

 

 

New Jersey statute provides that health benefit cost

increases in excess of 2% are excluded from the 2013 budget levy

  

cap. In 2013, of the $1,051,489 increase in health benefit
costs, $500,333 is excluded from the levy cap. (E~18)

Operating expenditure appropriations in the 2013 budget
decreased by $110,000 (0.65%) from the prior year.
Appropriations for employee medical insurance costs in 2013
increased $740,000 (5.25%) over the amounts appropriated for in
2012 (E-16). The net cost of maintaining County residents in
State mental hospitals in 2012 decreased $225,000 (43%) due to
credits applied from previous billings. (E-18)

General government program operating costs in 2013 remained
level from 2012 amounts. Department heads were asked to reduce

their 2013 operating expenditures budget requests where possible
4a

in order to offset increases in other programs. The reduction
requests were necessitated by Local Budget Law, which limits the

overall increase in the County Purpose Tax. (E-18)

 

In 2013, the Public Works/Uti ies budgets increased
$212,525 (2.8%) primarily due to expected increases in the cost
of road maintenance, motor pool costs, and maintenance repair
parts for the County’s buildings. (8-18)

Other departmental and program budget operating
expenditures remained relatively constant for 2013 or decreased
as a result of the Board’s determination to lower departmental
operating costs. (E-18)

Capital improvements funded from the 2013 budget increased
$900,000 (17.68) from 2012 levels (E-16; E-18). The County will
continue its pay-as-go philosophy to finance its ongoing and
routine capital improvement needs, such as road and bridge
maintenance, vehicle and equipment replacement and buildings and
grounds improvements. Of the increase, $700,000 is dedicated
capital savings for the anticipated future election system
replacement and courthouse renovations. The 2013 Capital
Improvement Program is essential to adequately maintain the
County's infrastructure, facilities and equipment. (E-18)

Debt service requirements will remain level in 2013. The

Freeholder Board places a high priority on reducing the County's
45

debt to minimize the financial burden on future generations.

In the 2013 Budget Message for Structural Budget
Imbalances, the County indicates its Fund Balance, as revenue,
is at risk. Further, it provides explanations as follows:
(E-18)

- The Board used $680,000 of surplus funds in excess of the
amount generated in 2012. These funds are used to balance
the budget with a tax increase that complies with the
statutory limitation. In addition, it adds that if this
practice continues it may result in unsustainable future
budget revenue shortfalls, requiring major reductions in
discretionary programs and services.

- The Board also utilized $1.2 million of rate stabilization
fund balance in the employee medical trust fund. The
surplus funds were accumulated as a result of savings

realized from favorable employee health care claims
46

experienced in prior years. The County joined the New
Jersey State Health Benefit Plan in 2009 and no longer
self-insures, therefore the surplus will not be
regenerated. When the remaining $3.5 million surplus is
depleted, the County could be forced to make significant
program and service cuts.

- It noted that the phase-in of greater employee
contributions ($328,588) to offset the substantial cost of
health care coverage will help reduce the burden on County
taxpayers in future budgets.

The following chart reflects Warren County’s Summary Total
Appropriations, Less Budgeted Anticipated Revenues, and the
Amounts to Be Raised by Taxation (County Purpose Tax) for years

2012 and 2013: (E-18)

‘Amount to be Raised by
Taxation $66,900,786 | $68,957,356

 

 

The proposed 2013 County operating budget will require
$68,957,356 in County Purpose Tax. This amount is an increase
over the 2012 generated amount. This increase is also below the

Stat

 

mandated cap laws. (E-18)
47

FOP exhibit (FOP-C), Resolution 194-13, April 10, 2013,
approved the Warren County Annual Budget and County Purpose Tax
Levy for the Fiscal Year 2013 as reflected in the above chart.
Board Freeholder Gardner stated in the resolution that even
though the tax levy has increased from the prior year, that
there is no tax increase to the public taxpayers. As reflected
in County exhibit (E-2), the County’s Board of Freeholders has
not increased its County Purpose Tax since 2008, or five years.

In the process of developing the budget, Sarnoski
emphasized that the County had to determine the best way to
address the $3.5 million deficit at the beginning of the
process, which they accomplished. He continued to state that
the County’s reliance on their surplus spending must end if the
County was to remain solvent in the future. (FOP-C)

One of the largest contributing factors to the deficit was
the Warren Haven Nursing Home operation (FOP-C). Houck
testified that the recently privatization of Warren Haven's
support services, in conjunction with a layoff of 43 County
employees effective July 1, 2013, would cut costs by $1.4
million.

During 2012, the equalized value of assessments (Tax Base)
decreased by $39,055,268 to $11,515,191,671 at year-end. The
2012 Equalized Tax Rate was 57.2 cents per $100 of Tax Base.

Given the proposed County Purpose Tax, the projected Tax Rate in
48

2013 should be $9.8 cents per $100 Equalized Assessed Valuation.
The County’s Equalized Valuation has declined by 13.7% since
2008. (B=2)

Houck testified that the Equalized Property Value (EPV) has
declined in the last three to four years. He explained that
each town has its own assessor and its own market-to-valuation
ratio. These assessments and ratios feed into the County’s
Purpose Tax rate. He testified that the declining EPV’s has
caused significant fiscal stress in the County. In addition,
federal sequestration is also causing cuts in the Housing
Assistance Payment Program (Section 8 housing) .

The chart below depicts the Equalized Valuation for Warren
County for the years 2008 through 2012: (E-1-P)

Current Working Conditions
The FOP points out that working in a correctional facility

can be stressful and dangerous. Correctional officers have a

 

gher rate of on the job injuries, largely owing to
conflicts with inmates. Officers Bowlby and Lovenberg
testified that officers often face dangerous altercations with
inmates and also the added risks of being targeted outside of
the work facilities by former inmates.

In addition, correction personnel are frequently required
to work extra shifts resulting in fatigue, low morale and

family-related problems. According to research performed by
49

the Wayne State University in 1997, suicide rates among
correctional officers are 39% higher than the rest of the

working age population. (FOP-E, p.34)

 

While correction officers are only required to possess a
high school education, they go through a rigorous training
period at the Police Academy and are required to qualify with
firearms both initially and annually. In addition, correction
officers are, by State statute, empowered to carry a weapon at
any time off duty and are required to act in the event that a
crime is permitted when they are present.

Existing Wages and Benefits

Warren County correction officers staff the County Jail on

round-the-clock shifts; officers work steady shifts on either

first, second or third shifts. Each shift includes a 30-minute

 

paid meal break. Each shift is eight hours, plus an additional
15 minutes extra per shift for muster time. Officers work four
days on, one day off; then four days on, two days off; then
three days on, two days off. The stationary shifts are 6:45 am
to 3:00 pm; 2:45 pm to 11:00 pm; and 10:45 pm to 7:00 am.

Employees are currently being paid from the following

In addition to their base salary, correction officers
receive shift differential of $.35 per hour for the second shift,
$.60 per hour for the third shift, and $.75 per hour for weekend
shifts. Officers are currently paid straight time for the extra
15 minutes per shift. Correction officers who work overtime are
paid at a rate of time and one-half of the officer's base
pay. County Financial Analyst Vijay Kapoor calculated that the
portion of officers’ base wage compensation amounted to 90% of

total compensation, with the remaining 10% being paid as

 

overtime and shift differenti (B-2, p. 37) Correction
officers are also paid longevity pay of $400 after five

ted years of service, and $1,000 after completing ten

 

of service. (E+2, p, 20) In addition, correction

officers are provided an annual uniform and maintenance

 

$775 beginning with their second year of

 

service. (E-2, p. 20)
st

Officers enjoy 14 paid holidays per year. As to leave
time, officers annually receive 12 to 25 vacation days per
year depending on length of service, and 12 days’ sick leave in

the

ry first year of service, with 15 days annually
thereafter.

Officers are eligible for hospitalization, major medical,
dental, and prescription benefits after 90 days of service.
Employees are currently contributing pursuant to Chapter 78,
P.L. 2011, a percentage of premium costs in tier 3 of
contributions rates, meaning that they currently contribute
between 5.25% (for an employee at entry level step on the
salary guide) and 14.25% (officers at top pay) for family
coverage; and between 9.08 and 21.75% for single coverage.
Officers, who retire with 25 years’ service or on a disability
pension, receive retiree health benefits. If the officer is
under age 55 at the time of his retirement, (except disability)
he is required to reimburse the County for the full cost of the
health care plan. The Employer then resumes paying health care
plan costs when the retiree attains age 55. Employees also
have prescription benefits, an eye care plan and a dental plan.

Internal Comparability

PBA Local 280 represents Warren County's sheriff's

officers and sheriff's superior officers. In April 2012, the
52

employer signed an agreement with Local 280 covering the period
2009-2011. The parties agreed to salary guide step movement in
each year of the contract as well as a commitment that the
salary guide would survive the expiration of the agreement, and
that employees would move on the salary guide in 2012. The

2009-2012 conzract provided for salary increases only for

 

sheriff's officers at the top step of 3% in 2009, 3% increases
in 2010, and 3% in 2011. That agreement provided for a top
salary of $64,620 in 2009, $66,559 in 2010 and $68,556 in 2011.
Sergeants received a wage freeze for the first thirty months of
the contract and then received a 13.2% increase in July 2011.
Lieutenants also had a wage freeze for the first thirty months
of the contract which was followed by a 22.3% increase in July
2011.

On August 29, 2013, the Employer concluded negotiations
with the Sheriff's officers for 2012-14 and the parties signed
a Memorandum of Agreement. This agreement provided for a 2%
increase to all unit employees in 2012; a $1,450 increase to
all unit employees in 2013 and the elimination of the clothing

allowances concurrently therewith; ®

 

and a 2% increase in 2014.

Top pay for a sheriff's officer in 2013 will be $71,377 and in

 

 

In 2013, the clothing allowance plus clothing maintenance allowance totaled
$1,175.

2014, $72,805. This tentative agreement has been ratified by
the membership but not yet approved by the County Freeholders.

FOP Lodge 170 represents the County’s correction

  

superiors. In April 2011, the County signed a successor
agreement with the FOP, covering 2011-2013 and providing for 2%
increases in each year of the contract.

PBA Local 331 represents the detectives and investigators
employed by the Warren County Prosecutor. In August 2012,

Local 331 and the prosecutor signed a new successor agreement

 

for 2012-2013 which included 2% increases in each year of the
new agreement. It also included step increases for each year

of the agreement as well as step increases to be effective

AFSCME represents the County’s blue and white collar unit,
which is the County’s largest bargaining unit. This unit also
includes support employees at Warren Haven and tele-
communicators. A contract signed in May, 2011, covered 2009-
2011, and provided for a 18-month wage freeze for January 1, 2009
through June 23, 2010; a 1% increase effective June 24; and a 2%
increase effective January 1, 2011. This agreement includes a
provision that employees hired after May 26, 2011 are ineligible
for post-retirement health benefits. It also includes a
provision that requires retirees under age 65 to contribute, on a
sliding scale, depending upon the pension annuity amount, a
quarterly payment for medical insurance, ranging from $66 to $303
per quarter.

On August 28, 2013, AFSCME and the County signed a
memorandum of agreement for a successor contract to cover 2012-
2015 for this unit. This agreement provided for a 1.0%
increase in 2013 and a 3.0% increase in 2014, with no increases
for 2012 or 2015. Uniform allowances were increased slightly,
and longevity was increased in 2014 to between $650 and $1,650;
and the parties also agreed to the County’s Storm and Emergency
Closing provision.

AFSCME Local 0671 represents the County’s blue and white
collar supervisory employees. On October 10, 2012, the County

signed a successor agreement with AFSCME for 2012-2014. The
55

agreement provided for a 1.5% across-the-board increase in each
year of the contract. It is noteworthy that this contract
provided that new employees hired after March 9, 2011 will be
ineligible for post-retirement medical benefits

CWA represents Warren County’s public health nurses. In

March 2013, CWA signed a successor agreement with the County

  

covering 2012-2014. The parties agreed to a 1.5% increase in
each year of the new agreement. The parties also agreed to
movement on the step guide for each year of the agreement.

CWA Loca: 1071 represents employees of the County
Department of Human Services, Division of Temporary Assistance

and Social Services ("TASS” This unit includes such job

 

categories as social workers, income maintenance workers, and
support staff.’ In August, 2011, the parties signed a
successor agreement covering 2011 through 2013. The contract
provides for a 2% salary increase in each year of the contract
The contract also includes a 12~step salary guide, and while
the contract is silent about step guide movement, I infer that
employees annually move from step to step on the guide. In
January, 2013, the parties amended the contract to include the

Storm/Emergency Closings policy it is also proposing for this

Co. Board of Social Services.

 
56

unit. The language is identical to that proposed by the County
in this matter.

CWA Local 1032 represents the clerical employees in the
County Prosecutor's office. The contract is silent on whether
employees move automatically through the salary range to reach
maximum. On September 26, 2012, the Prosecutor signed a
successor contract with CWA for 2012-2014, which provided for a
1.5% across-the-board salary increase applicable to the
minimums and maximums of the salary ranges in each year. This
unit does not have a step guide, but rather, each title is
identified with a salary “range” of minimums and maximums. In
January, 2013, this unit also signed an agreement with the
Employer concerning the Storm and Emergency Closings, which was
then appended to the contract.

The factor of internal comparability, based upon
existing agency and court precedent, is a factor that is
not only specifically addressed in the statutory criteria

(N.J.S.A. 34:13A-16g(2)(c)], but also has been found to

 

fall within the criteria of the "interests and welfare of

the public" and the "continuity and stability of

    

employment." The Public Employment Relations Commission
has recognized the importance of considering internal
comparability in its controlling case law on interest

arbitration.
57

In County of Union, P.E.R.C. No. 2003-33, 28 NJPER 459,461
(133169, 2002), the Commission stated:
Pattern is an important labor relations concept that
is relied upon by both labor and management
deviation from a settlement pattern can affect the
continuity and stability of employment by discouraging
future settlements and undermining employee morale
in other units.
An internal pattern is relevant to the "comparability"
criterion, N.J.S.A. 34:13A-169(2)(c); N.J.A.C. 19:16-
5.14(c) (5), and to the "continuity and stability of
employment" criterion, N.J.S.A. 34:13A-16g(8). Id., 28
NJPER at 461. An interest arbitration award that does not
give due weight to an internal pattern is subject to

reversal and remand. County of Union, P.E.R.C. No. 2003-87,

29 NJPER 250,253 (475, 2003).

External Comparability

As previously stated, I consider the northern counties in

the immediate area of Warren County, to be the most relevant in

terms of examining correction employees in similar
jurisdictions. The chart below shows salaries from 2009
through 2013, where available. Those jurisdictions which I

consider to be most relevant are in bold text:

The Union also proffered a chart showing the top pay rates
for correction officers in 18 of the 21 counties. (FOP Brief p.
13) According to the FOP’s chart, the average top pay among
correction officers statewide was $75,429 in 2010. The data

supporting the FOP’s chart was replicated from an earlier

inter

 

st arbitration award. It is noted that supporting
documentation was not supplied to support this summary chart,
but even assuming that the FOP’s summary information is
accurate, I assign little weight to this conclusion. as
explained previously, the more relevant comparable data is the
salary information of the counties in the immediate Warren

County geographic area.
59

Consumer Price Index (CPI)

The Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) cites the Chained
(C-CPI-U) as its most accurate measure of cost-of-living. The
BLS also produces indexes for local areas, including the New
York-Northern New Jersey-Long Island and NY-NJ-CT-PA

Metropolitan Area (CPI-W) cove.

  

g all urban wage earners.
While available for a longer duration and regionally focused,
the County notes that the BLS advises such areas are less
reliable due to sample size volatility. (E-2)

The County states that for the contract period of January
1, 2007 through December 31, 2010, correction officers received
across-the-board wages (compounded) totaling 12.6% and 26.7% for

officers at the maximum step. I assume that this data i

 

inclusive of increment amounts, It notes that the cumulative
wage growth of all correction officers outpaced the growth of

consumer prices of regional CPI-W and chained CPI-U from 2008

 

 

through 2010. (£-2}
The County asserts that its chart below represents the

Warren County Correction Officer wages increases versus the CPI

increase for 2007 through 2010: (E-2)

The County avers that currently the median years of service
for a correction officer in the bargaining unit are seven years
of service. Over the term of the contract period of January 1,
2007 through December 31, 2010, the officer would have started
at step 2 and progressed to step 5. It states that the officer

would have received a 41.9% compounded increase over the term of

 

he contract when taking both the annual increases and step
movement on the salary guide. Kapoor testified that the
correction officer’s pay has outpaced the C-CPI-U and the CPI-w
since 2008. (E-2)

I note that these comparisons between correction
officer’s salary increases and each measure of CPI are based
upon increases allegedly granted by virtue of the last

interest arbitration award, which ended in 2010. No data was

 

provided as to the cost-of-living since January 1, 2011.
However, it is generally well known that the cost-of-living

as calculated by the CPI-U Index (all urban areas, not

seasonally adjusted) increased over the past twelve-month

 

period at an average annual rate at approximately 1.5%, as
reported by the Bureau of Labor Statistics.

PERC Son Aw:

 

th
61

The most recent salary increase analysis® for interest
arbitration on PERC’s website shows that the average increase

for awards from January 1, 2011 through December 31, 2011 was

 

2,058, while voluntary settlements for the same time period
averaged 1.87%. For 2012, awards averaged 1.86% while
settlements averaged 1.77%. For the period January 1, 2013
through August 20, 2013, awards averaged 1.66% while
settlements averaged 2.01%. Awards included various guide
adjustments, increases to top step only; limitations on
retroactivity; freezing of guide movement, and adding of steps
to a guide, It must be noted however, that most awards issued
in 2012 and 2013 were subject to the 2.0% interest arbitration
cap.
Private Sector Wage Survey

The New Jersey Department of Labor Wage Reports, issued
in September 2012 and August 23, 2013°, shows that the average
annual wages in the New Jersey private sector increased by
2.1% between 2011 and 2012 while the local governmental
sector increased during the same period by 1.4%. The same
report broken down by county shows a private sector wage
decrease in Warren County of -,9% between 2010 and 2011. The

same reports show that the annual wages in the State’s

62

private sector increase again increased between 2011-2012 by
2.1%, with the local government sector increasing by 1.5%.

I give almost no weight to the component of
comparability with the private sector other than to observe
the private sector wage increases as noted above, that New
Jersey's unemployment rate is about 7.4%, and the economic
recovery for everyone is slow to take root. On the one
hand, public sector law enforcement officers are not
subject to the same concerns as private sector workers or
even public sector civilians, in that layoffs are
infrequent and furloughs are non-existent. However, there
is no particular occupation, public or private, that is an
equitable comparison to correction officers. The
correction officers are unique in a variety of ways,
including the potential to be called upon to uphold the law
at any time, on and off duty; the obligation to carry a
weapon even off duty; the stress and dangers of the job,
the tightly regulated recruitment and training process;
and the lack of portability of public sector law
enforcement officer skills beyond a certain age and beyond
@ geographic region. Moreover, they are frequently
required to work evenings, nights and holidays. Unlike the
private sector, they do not compete in a global economy,

which tends to depress wages.

ANALYSIS OF SALARY ISSUES

Proposed Longevity Roll-In

The FOP proposes to eliminate longevity as a separate
benefit and to roll-in longevity into base pay effective with
the date of this award. Longevity pay is given to unit
employees near the end of the year annually. Correction
officers have already been paid their longevity benefit for 2011
and 2012, but have not yet been paid for 2013. The existing
longevity benefit provides officers with $400 after five years
of service and then $1,000 after ten years of service. The
County has not consented to this proposal. Instead, the County
officers to increase the longevity benefit by 2% annually for
the life of the contract.

I am not inclined to award the FOP’s proposal to eliminate
longevity and add $1,400 to top pay. While the FOP is correct
that, initially, the County would save money by implementing
this proposal, the long term costs do not justify awarding the
proposal. There are 32 correction officers at or above the five
year benchmark in 2013 which are each receiving the $400
longevity payment. There are 13 employees at or above the ten
year benchmark in 2013 which are due to receive the $1,000
longevity payment. In current dollars, the County is projected

to spend $27,200 for 2013 longe:

    

y payments (J-3). Awarding
64

the FOP’s proposal would mean that the 18 employees at top pay
in 2013 would each have $1,400 added to their base pay
immediately for a cost of $25,200 in 2013. Thus, the County
would save $2,000 by implementing this proposal in 2013.
However, the long term effect of adding $1,400 to base pay would
be that it would increase the base upon which overtime
calculations are derived. It would also increase holiday pay
and the payment of unused sick leave upon retirement (E-4,
Article 11) which is based upon daily rates of pay. In
addition, it would increase pension contributions for both the
County and for the correction officer.

From the correction officer’s point of view, the proposal
would effectively eliminate the $400 longevity payment currently
being enjoyed by 32 unit employees who have more than five
years, but less than ten years, of service with the County. If
the FOP’s proposal were awarded, these employees would have to
wait until they hit the top step of pay (at ten years) before
they realize any benefit of rolling-in the longevity to base
pay. The loss of $400 annually (between the employee’s fifth
year and his tenth year) totals $2,500 loss over a five-year
period, which would take another five years’ additional service
to recoup. Accordingly, I find that the long-term cost of this
proposal outweighs the benefit to the FOP members and is not in

the public interest. The proposal is not awarded.
65

The County proposes a 2% increase to longevity pay in each
year of the new contract. The FOP has not consented to this
proposal but offers no rationale in its brief explaining its

objections. Accordingly, I award the longevity increases as

Salary Increases

The County argues that this award is subject to the 2.08
cap on interest arbitration awards as mandated by Chapter 105
P.L. 2010. The 2008-2010 contract provides at Article 26,
“Duration” that, “The terms and provisions of this agreement
shall be in full force and effect commencing January 1, 2008 and
ending December 31, 2010”. Contracts with an expiration date of
December 31, 2010 have already been held by the Public
Employment Relations Commission to be exempted from the 2.0%
arbitration cap. See, Burlington County Prosecutor, P.E.R.C.
No. 2012-61, 39 NJPER 20 (44 2012), affirmed in relevant part,
N.J. App. Div., 40 NJPER 41 (2012), Pet for Cert. pending. This
matter does not dictate a different result. The 2.08
arbitration cap does not apply to the contract being awarded

herein,
66

With regard to the parties’ offers, I find that the
County’s offer of 0% for the life of the contract is not
justified by the facts of this case. I also find that the
Union’s proposal of 9.0% (before compounding), is equally
unrealistic.

First, employees moving through steps of the salary guide
have already received step advances in each year of the proposed
contract. Neither party is proposing that these increment
payments be rescinded; instead both parties propose that
employees not yet at top pay receive no across-the-board raises
for the life of the contract. The Employer's cost of providing
these increments was $206,883 in 2011, $265,397 in 2012, and
$251,839 in 2013, I agree with the parties that those
correction officers not yet at top step of the salary guide by
2013, are not entitled to any additional pay increases for the
life of the contract.

Article 7, Section 2 of the 2008-2010 contract specifically
provides:

(Als a condition to and in consideration for the

agreement for step movement, the FOP and the County

shall stipulate to the step movement in the year 2011

and in any subsequent year thereafter in accordance

with the provisions of N.J.S.A. 34:13A-16 (g) (4), in

any subsequent mediation or interest arbitration

proceeding.

It is further agreed that the cost of such step

movement must be considered by any such mediator or
interest arbitrator as part of the overall
67

compensation of these employees pursuant to N.J.S.A.
34:13A-16 (g) (3) and must be given due weight by the
interest arbitrator as part of the financial impact on
the governing unit, its residents and taxpayers in
2011 and in any subsequent year thereafter in
accordance with N.J.S.A. 34:13A-16 (g) (6).

 

 

I have carefully considered the cost of increment payments
already made for the life of this contract and its financial

impact on the County, Had the parties not voluntarily agreed to

 

a freeze of salary increases for these employees still moving
through the step guide, I would have so awarded it in any event.
I consider this a necessary measure to control salary costs,
notwithstanding the fact that employees in other Warren County
law enforcement groups, notably Prosecutor’s detectives and
Sheriff's officers, receive both salary increases and step
increments in recent contracts.

The County has now settled contracts through at least 2012
with nine of its bargaining units. Raises for employees covered
by these contracts ranged from 1% to 3% in each year of the most
recent contract. Here, the County’s offer of a wage freeze for

officers at top step of the salary guide would leave this group

 

as the only group in County employment to receive no pay
increase in a three-year period. As noted previously, a
comparison to other law enforcement groups in the same

jurisdiction, is not only dictated by the statutory criteria but

has previously been held by the Public Employment Relations
68

Commission to be an important factor in assessing salary rates
for the group under consideration.

On the other hand, the FOP’s demand for 3.0% across-the-
board increases annually significantly exceeds pay increases
awarded to County employees in every other bargaining unit and
has not been justified.

A comparison of the salaries of Warren County’s correction
officers to the pay rates of other law enforcement groups in the
County shows that historically correction officers have been
slightly ahead or slightly behind sheriff's officers - - a
group I consider to be close cousins to correction officers.
Both groups work under the jurisdiction of the County's
sheriff's department. Both groups handle the same population of
felons, albeit at different stages of processing through the

investigatory and judicial phase and later the custodial phase.

 

ties, similar

 

Both groups have similar duties and responsibil
hazards and risks of the job, and similar law enforcement powers
to act on and off-duty.

In 2008, sheriff's officers earned top pay of $62,738 while
correction officers received a top pay of $61,161. By 2010,
correction officers were $2,500 ahead of sheriff's officers pay
in that sheriff’s officers earned $66,559 while correction
officers earned $68,836. This is in part attributable to

2009

 

corrections officers having a received a 6.0% increase i
69

and again in 2010, while sheriff's officers received a 3.0%
increase during the same period. In 2013, sheriff's officers’
salary at top pay is now $71,377, assuming that the County
approved the recent memorandum of understanding for a 2011-2014
contract with that bargaining unit. Here, I intend to award a
2.08 increase annually to top pay correction officers for the
life of the contract. This will put correction officers and
sheriff's officers more in line with each other in terms of pay
comparability.

I note that the settlement in correction superiors provided
for a 2,0% across-the-board increase in 2011, another 2.0%
increase in 2012, and another 2.0% increase in 2013. By 2013,
correction superiors’ pay exceeded the pay rates for sheriff's
superiors by only a few hundred dollars. While sheriff’s
officers might be considered close cousins to correction
officers, correction superiors are the most closely related
group in that they hold the positions next in line in a
correction officer’s career path. Therefore, I give significant
weight to the internal patterns of settlement for these two
groups. Here, my award of 2.0% annually for top pay correction
officers parallels the increases negotiated with the correction
superiors.

As previously discussed above, an analysis of the external

pay rates of correction officers in comparable jurisdictions,
70

would include the New Jersey counties surrounding Warren County
and, to a lesser extent, the Pennsylvania counties of
Northampton and Monroe. An analysis of the three contiguous New
Jersey counties (Sussex, Morris and Hunterdon) reveals an
average top pay of $77,089; while the two contiguous
Pennsylvania counties has an average of $46,549. I give greater
weight to the pay rates in the New Jersey counties as the
Pennsylvania counties had a significantly lower cost-of-living
and 80% of Warren County’s employees do not live in
Pennsylvania. Warren County’s correction officers have a
current pay of $68,836, which is more than $8,000 under the
average of New Jersey county correction officers in the relevant
area. It is also about $7,000 below the State-wide average for
all correction officers. Therefore, this across-the-board pay
increase for correction officers at top step needs to be awarded
so that these employees can at least maintain their ranking
without falling further behind average pay.

It is in the public interest that County correction
officers’ pay scales remain competitive with other jurisdictions
to attract and retain quality officers. Otherwise, turnover
rates will increase and public funds will be wasted on
recruitment and training expenditures only to see employees
leave Warren County employ to seek employment in higher paying

jurisdictions. This also supports the criteria of continuity
n

and stability of employment. High turnover rates leave the
correction officer workforce with inexperience staff which in

turn further endangers the safety of correction of.

 

ers.
Accordingly, I find that a 2.0% increase in each year of the
award for officers at top pay is an appropriate raise and is
supported by the evidence. Additionally, it will allow officers
at top pay to keep pace with cost-of living increases during the
contract period.

However, to limit the cost to the County for retroactivity
payments, the 2.0% annual raises will be effective on July 1 of
each year.

I find that the increases being awarded herein are within

the County's ability to pay and will not endanger violation the

 

Employer’s lawful authority, including the appropriations and
levy caps. First, the money the County expended to pay
correction officers’ increments, as well as longevity payments
for 2011 and 2012, has already been appropriated and expended.
It does not need to appropriate additional funds to cover these
costs.

Second, in the 2013 budget the County has $362,376 reserves
in its salary account for the County jail. ‘The County’s own
witness testified that this reserve amount is not likely to be

expended for current expenses in 2013 and is potentially

available for raises. While it appears that the County woul,

 
2

 

e to hold down costs increases for this bargaining unit to
partially offset declining revenues associated with the Warren
Haven Nursing Home, I note that no other County bargaining unit
(including AFSCME, which represents Warren Haven employees) made
such a sacrifice. It would be unfair to the 18 employees at top
step to now ask these employees to accept a three-year wage
freeze because the County has a large deficit associated with
Warren Haven.

Third, the total cost of correction officers’ salaries
including longevity and uniform allowance, pursuant to J-3,
actually decreased by $91,920 from 2012 into 2013. Accordingly,
I find that there will be no financial impact on the taxpayers
of Warren County by virtue of this award. Further, this award
will have no impact on the County's cap limits.

ry Guide Revisions

The FOP proposes to decrease the starting salary for new
correction officers hired after the date of this award from the
current rate of $41,080 to $38,000. It also proposes to add an
additional step between existing steps 8 and 9 on the salary

guide. The existing salary guide is as follows:
23

The County has not consented to either FOP proposals concerning
salary guide provisions but its brief provides no argument as to
why these proposals should not be awarded. I intend to award
both proposals.

With regard to the new recruitment rate, the proposed rate
of $38,000 is $3,080 below what the County is currently paying
new recruits. I am confident this lower recruitment rate will
not deter qualified applicants from applying with corrections
positions with Warren County especially given the current
economic conditions and New Jersey's unemployment rate of 7.4%.
Recruits only remain at step one on the salary guide until
graduation from the academy or completion of their first year of
employment, whichever comes first. It is always in the public
interest to obtain quality public services at the least possible
cost provided it does not impact on unit stability and

continuity. I find that this new recruit rate will have no
4

impact on unit stability and continuity and at the same time
will save the County money. I award this proposal.

The FOP also proposed to add a new step between step 8 and
step 9 of the salary guide effective with the date of the award.
As shown below, after the 2.0% annual increases are applied to

the top step, the increment amount between the step 8 and step 9

   

is $14,748. This “bubble” is too large an increment value to be
paid an employee all at one time and therefore needs to be cut

half. Therefore, I award the creation of a new step 9 half

 

way between old step 8 and step 9. The step formerly called

step 9 will become step 10. The resulting salary guide is as

 

 

follows:

To be clear, all current employees at or below step 8 will

progress normally through the salary guide when increments are
75

paid. Employees currently at step @ will move to the new step 9
when increments are paid. Employees currently at step 9 on the
old salary guide will not be reduced in salary but will be paid
at the new step 10 on the salary guide. No current employee
will be reduced in salary as the result of implementation of
this guide.

Adoption of the salary guide above is in the public
interest as it will reduce the price of increments going forward
at the top step. It is my belief that adoption of this new
salary guide will not negatively impact upon unit continuity or
stability or employee morale.

Future Increments

The County proposes to eliminate the step guide going
forward into future contract years. The FOP vigorously opposes
this position. The FOP argues that the County has provided no
evidence why the continued provision of step movement within
the salary guide would be detrimental to either the County or
to the public.

The FOP emphasizes that the County has continued step
movement for both the Prosecutor’s detectives as well as the
sheriff’s officers. To treat the correction officers
differently would be manifestly unfair.

The FOP cites testimony of both President Lovenberg

and Vice-President Bowlby that eliminating the step guide
76

would be very detrimental to morale and would destroy the
salary system which has been maintained over the past
decade. They have testified that officers view the step
system as integral to their salary system. Further,
according to Lovenberg and Bowlby, it would be very difficult
to recruit and maintain competent officers if they are not
able to advance on the guide. Both Lovenberg and Bowlby
testified that, in the past, without step movement the
turnover was significant. The FOP cites the 2003 award of
Arbitrator Glasson in which Glasson found that automatic
step movement on the guide was then an absolutely necessary
component to solve the County’s severe turnover problem,
which was causing a wasteful expenditure of recruiting and
training costs as new hires would go through the academy
and then leave for other jurisdictions where salary
adjustment is possible. The FOP argues that, without the
continuation of step movement, all of the problems
outlined by Arbitrator Glasson would return.

Further, the FOP maintains that the costs of increments
are funds already expended by the County since officers have
moved through the guide for all three years.

I am disinclined to eliminate the step guide from the

contract as the County proposes. In 2003, Arbitrator Glasson
7

awarded automatic movement on the step guide and reduced the

steps from 13 to 9 steps. He reasoned:

The parties agree that the single most important
issue in this matter is the high turnover rate of
correction officers and the need to improve the
Salary structure for correction officers. This issue
is paramount to the interest and welfare of the
public. Recruitment and retention of correction
officers is a serious problem in Warren County as
evident by the large number of correction officers on
Step 1 through 4 on the 2002 salary guide. The 2002
data shows 50 correction officers on various steps of
the salary guide. 35 of the officers are on the
first four steps of the 12~step salary guide. The
salaries of these 35 officers range from 26,288 to
$30,232. There are only five officers on the top
three steps. There is clearly a high incidence of
turnover.

This turnover creates a continuous need to train newly
hired officers. Training of Correction Officers is
justifiably an expensive proposition. Tt is
exceedingly expensive when you have a high turnover
rate. High turnover produces a continuing spiral of
recruitment and training resulting in a significant
number of inexperienced Correction Officers. The
parties agree that in the best interest of the County
and the FOP (and certainly the interest and welfare
of the public) to reverse the high turnover rate and
stabilize the work force, This is important in all
work environments but it is particularly important in
a correctional facility given the inherited dangers of
the job and the need to maintain the highest levels of
safety and supervision, Highly trained and
experienced correction officers are essential to
maintaining high standards of safety and supervision.
The FOP and the County recognize the need to reverse
the high turnover rate and provide a better salary
structure with the career path to maximum. It is
also the norm for Correction Officers employed by
the State of New Jersey and nearly all municipal police
departments in the State.
78

The same rationale applies today. Outright elimination of
the step guide would mean that employees, especially those in
the lower steps, would remain frozen in place on the guide
without any possibility of upward mobility to higher pay and
would result in these employees inevitably moving on to other
employers where such upward mobility is offered. This in turn
would cost the County in wasted training dollars. It would also
demoralize employees and cause high turnover, which in turn
would result in a less experienced workforce to staff the County
Jail. None of these outcomes could be considered to further the
public interest.

While I will not dismantle the employees’ current step
guide, I intend to freeze employees on their current step going
forward into the next contract unless certain circumstances
dictate otherwise as discussed below. At the expiration of this
contract, this bargaining unit will be subject to the 2.0% cap
on arbitration awards pursuant to Chapter 105, P.L. 2010. Under
the provisions of this statute, an interest arbitrator is
limited to awarding a maximum of 2.0% increases in base salary

which is inclusive of base pay, increments, and longevit

 

 

increases. In January, 2014, approximately 46 employees would
be eligible to receive step increases. Step increases have in
recent years cost the County more than $250,000 per year for

this unit. It is therefore very likely that the increment load
79

will far exceed the available cap should the parties require
interest arbitration to settle the contract. The outcome in
these circumstances is often to forego or delay increments or,
where increments have been paid, to freeze the salary guide in
place for at least part of the contract period. In short,
payment of increments in January might well mean that there is
no money left available under the 2.0% cap for any increases for
unit employees beyond increments. Alternatively, officers might
be required to repay increment amounts that have already been
paid out. Therefore, I award the following contract language:

an interest arbitration salary cap is still in
effect as of January 1, 2014, Officers who are not at
top step in 2013 will not move to the next step in the
guide in 2014 until the parties finalize a successor
agreement though negotiations or through interest
arbitration. Those officers will then move, if
applicable, pursuant to the terms of the successor
agreement. If the 2014 step movement cost does not
exceed any interest on salary cap in effect

sf Janu L, 2014, upon mutual agreement by the
parties, those officers in the guide shall receive

is step increment in 2014 prior to resolving the
successor agreement.

 

 

    

      

I note that this same language is also contained in the recent
memorandum of agreement between the County and the PBA for the
sheriff's officers unit. Awarding this language is in the
interests of the public, in the interest of the County and in
the interest of the correction officer bargaining unit as a

whole in that it will broaden the possibilities for bargaining a
80

successor agreement without the handicap of increment costs
already incurred.
Cost of the Award

The cost of the awarded salary increases for 2011 is $5,508
(8 officers x $1,377 increase /2 = $5,508). The cost of the

awarded salary increases for 2012 is $14,634 (13 officers x

$1,404 increase /2 = $9,126; plus carryover costs from 2011

increase of $5,508 = $14,634). For 2013, the cost of the
awarded salary increases is $22,014 (18 officers x $1,432

increase /2 = $12,888; plus the carryover costs from 2012

 

reases of $9,126 = 22,014).

The cost of longevity increases as provided in this award
is $2,719 in 2011; $476 in 2012; and $4,355 in 2013.'° The costs
to increases in the uniform and maintenance allowance are $1,200
for 2011; $1,260 for 2012; and $1,260 for 2013 (based upon 60

employees).

NON-SALARY ISSUES:

Emergency Closures

The Employer proposes to add the following new provision to

the contract under Article 8, Overtime:

 

 

Longevity costs shown above factor in changes in the workforce whi
resulted in fewer employees being longevity eligible

   
81

Section 4:
A Storm Day or Emergency requiring the closure of
County offices shall mean only an official declaration
of same made by the Board of Chosen Freeholders or the
County Administrator and shall not include those
declared by the State of New Jersey or those
promulgated by the Warren County Department of Public
Safety, Office of Emergency Management. For purposes
of this Agreement, a Storm Day or Emergency declared
by the Board of Chosen Freeholders or County
Administrator shall be memorialized by memorandum to
be filed with and retained by the Finance Department,
Payroll and shall include starting and ending dates
and times of the closure of County offices.

  

 

Non-Essential Employees

Should an employee report for work and subsequently
the Employer decide to officially close the Employer's
offices for any reason, such employees that report to
work shall be credited for the day’s work. Should the
Employer for any reason officially close the
Employer's offices before the start of the workday,
all employees scheduled to work that day will be
credited with a day’s work.

 

Essential Employees
Essential employees shall be paid double time for each

hour worked by them during a Storm Day or Emergency
when officially declared by the Board of Chosen
Freeholders or County Administrator. The double time
shall be earned for all hours worked during the entire
period of an officially declared storm or emergency.

In the event an essential employee cannot report for
work because of storm conditions or emergency
conditions, the time lost from work will be charged
against accumulated vacation or personal leave time.
In the event that no such leave time is available, the
time lost from work will be charged as time off
without pay. If an essential employee is unable to
report to work, the employee must report this absence
no less than one and one-half (1 4) hours before the
starting time of their shift or the start of their
normal workday.

Determination as to which employees are essential and
which are non-essential may vary given the
82

circumstances of such event leading to the issuance of
an official declaration of a storm day or emergency.
Department/division heads are given authority to
determine classification of essential and non-
essential employees. At minimum, essential employees
shall always include those necessary to maintain
statutory or code-related mandated minimum staffing
levels at Warren County’s 24-hour institutions/
operations.

Non-Essential and Essential Employees with Previously

Approved Leave of Absence:

During any officially declared storm day or emergency,
employees absent from work for a previously approved
leave of absence, paid or unpaid, shall remain in such
status. These may include vacation leave, personal
leave, sick leave, workers’ compensation leave,
FMLA/FLA leave, disciplinary leave. In the event that
an essential employee with a previously approved leave
of absence is available to report for work, is called
out by their Department/Division head and does report
for work, such employee shall be paid as described in
this Agreement and the previously approved leave time
shall be credited to the employee's leave time
balances.

 

The existing contract provides for:

Section 4

Employees shall be paid double time for each hour worked by
them during a storm or other emergency when the storm day
or emergency is officially declared by the Employer and
nonessential employees are officially excused from work or
from reporting to work, The double time shall only be
earned during the period when nonessential employees are
excused from work or from reporting to work due to the
storm or emergency condition. This Section only applies to
countywide circumstances. The word “officially" as used in
this paragraph shall mean only an official declaration by
either the County Administrator or the Board of Chosen
Freeholders.

The Employer seeks the new language on a prospective

basis from date of award, It argues that the purpose of the
83

language is to bring clarity to its storm/emergency policy
after the “trials and tribulations” experienced when the
cunty closed its offices to all but non-essential personnel

after Hurric

 

ane Sandy. It notes that the language in the
expired contract is now the subject of a separate grievance
arbitration scheduled in December, 2013. The County also
notes that the newly proposed language has already been
adopted by other bargaining units and is an improvement over

existing language in the FOP Lodge 171 contract.

 

FOP maintains that this County proposal has not been
supported by evidence in the record which would justify it,
and therefore, it should be rejected.

T have compared the existing contract language to the
proposal to discern what the impact might be on correction
officers specifically. First, under both the old and the new
language, the decision to declare an emergency/storm day rests
with the employer - - either the Board of Freeholders or the
County Administrator, not any outside entity, such as the
State. Second, both the old and the new language provide that
correction officers working on the emergency/snow day are
entitled to double-time day. The new language would require
the employer to set a start time and stop time to the

“emergency”, thus making it clear what hours exactly are
double-time eligible -- as opposed to simply a “storm day”,
which allows for far more ambiguity. Fourth, the prior policy
did not distinguish between essential personnel and non-
essential personnel - - the new policy does. The new policy
permits the employer to designate employees into either the
essential or non-essential category. Given the nature of
correction officers’ work, I assume that most correction

sitions would be deemed essential, but this may not

 

be true of all unit positions. The record is silent on this;
however, IT note that the MoA with the sheriff’s officers
designated all unit personnel as “essential.”

The new language adds that employees who cannot report
for work will be charged with vacation or personal leave.
While this was not included in the prior language, I have to
assume that anytime an employee cannot come to work results in
the employee being charged leave time. While the new language
appears not to permit an employee from charging sick time on
an emergency day, that is a fair result, as sick leave is
meant to cover an employee's illness.

I also note that most of the County’s employee units have
signed on to the same snow/emergency policy, including
APSCME’s County-wide civilian unit, and the Sheriff's

officers. Thus, awarding this snow/emergency day policy will
85

provide consistency among County employees and clarity to the
contract lancuage, which in turn will reduce disputes over

amb. interest. The

 

Snow/Emergency Day proposal is awarded.
comp Time
Article 10, Section 3, concerns the scheduling of
employee compensatory time off. This section currently
provides,

With regard to the scheduling of compensatory days
off, the first through the seventh such days off in
any calendar year shall be scheduled by the employee
by requesting same at least 14 calendar days in
advance, which request shall be granted by the
employer provided that the requested day off may be
granted without interference with the proper conduct
of the government function involved.

The Employer seeks to amend this language to provide:

With regard to the scheduling of compensatory days
off, the first through the seventh such days off in
any calendar year shall be requested by the employee
and the compensatory day shall occur before September
15. Any days not selected to occur before September
is*" may be scheduled by the administration. This
request may be granted by the Sheriff provided that
the requested day off may be scheduled without
interference with the proper conduct of the government
function involved...

 

 

 

 

 

 

The FOP argues that the County has provided no evidence
why a change in this contract article should occur and
therefore, it should be denied. There has been no evidence
that the contract clause has created a problem and there has

been no evidence how this would be beneficial either to the
86

employees or the public.

It appears that the Employer seeks to have employees
schedule seven of their comp days to be taken before September
15, and if not taken by that date, the administration may
designate the officer’s comp time days. It appears that the
Employer is seeking to have employees use up their comp days
before the end of a given calendar year and not carry them
forward from year to year. However, the County has not
provided any information in record that would reveal what
problem this proposal is designed to correct. Are employees
accumulating significant comp time leave? Are too many
employees putting in for comp days during peak vacation times
around the holidays? Are employees now carrying comp time from
year to year? Without additional information, this proposal
contract revision has not been justified, and I decline to
award it.

Leave Approval

Article 11, Section 9: currently provides,

 

Section $: Leaves Without Pay

The grant or denial of request for leave without pay is
discretionary with the County. The request must be
made in advance and must be recommended by the
employee's department head, with the appointing
authority retaining the ultimate decision-making power.
If the department head is opposed to the request, the
employee shall have the right to file a written
submission with the appointing authority. The
appointing authority shall have the discretion, on
87

his own or at the employee’s request, to schedule a
meeting with the employee and his union
representative, to discuss the request. The decision
of the appointing authority shall be final and non-
reviewable (emphasis added) .

The Employer seeks a change to the second and third
sentences such that the recommendation would come from the
employee’s supervisor rather than the department head. The
provisions otherwise remained unchanged. The FOP has not
consented to this language, but has presented no specific
argument in its brief concerning its opposition

It appears to me that this proposal merely changes the
designated Employer representative responsible for making a
recommendation concerning an employee's request for unpaid
leave. The choice of a designated representative to make such
recommendations should be uniquely up to the Employer in any
event. I see no adverse impact to the correction officer unit
by awarding this minor change, particularly since the language
permits an employee an avenue of appeal in the event that the
supervisor recommends against granting an unpaid leave. This

contract revision is awarded.

Bereavement Leaves
The Employer seeks to rewrite this entire section of

the contract. The existing contract language provides
88

Section 6: Bereavement Leave
The County shall provide bereavement leave with pay not to
exceed three (3) working days in the case of death of an
employee's spouse, children, brothers, sisters, mother,
father, mother-in-law, father-in-law, grandchildren or
grandparents. Additional days may be approved by the Warden
in advance and charged against administrative personal
leave.

  

The County may provide one working day's bereavement leave
with pay in the case of death of a relative of the second
degree; that is, uncle, aunt, niece, nephew, cousin,
sister-in-law or brother-in-law provided the granting of
such leave by the Warden is not grievable under his contract.
As soon as possible, an employee shall notify the Warden of
a death in his family, and of his need for leave.
Notification must be given as in the case of Sick Leave.
Proof of death may be required by the County.

The new contract language, as the Employer proposes,
would increase maximum bereavement leave and rewrite the
clause as follows:

1. The Sheriff shall provide bereavement leave with
pay not to exceed five (5) working days total per
calendar year, A maximum of five (5) bereavement
days may be utilized in case of the death of a first
degree relative as defined below. Any remaining
balance of unused bereavement leave days can be
utilized in the case of the death of a first degree
relative or second degree relative as defined below.
With regard to second degree relatives, employees
shall be limited to one (1) bereavement leave day per
occurrence.

2, First degree relatives shall be defined as
follows: an employee’s spouse, civil union partner,
children, foster children, brothers, sisters, mother,
father, mother-in-law, father-in-law, grandchildren,
grandparents, step-children, step-mother, step-
father, son-in-law, daughter-in-law, grandparents-in-
law. Additional days may be approved by the Sheriff
and charged against other types of leave.
89

3. Second degree relatives shall be defined as
follows: an employee’s uncle, aunt, niece, nephew,
cousin, sister-in-law, or brother-in-law or persons
sharing the same residency, living quarters, or
dwelling provided that proof of cohabitation is
provided.

 

This proposal appears to enhance the bereavement leave
benefit to the employees. However, the FOP has opposed this
proposal. The Employer has not provided me with sufficient

justification in the record for changing the benefit.

 

Accordingly, the proposal cannot be granted.

Retiree’s Health Benefits

The Employer asks to change Article 13, Medical Benefits;
specifically, section C, as follows:

Employees hired after the execution date of this
agreement will not be entitled to lifetime benef
upon retirement from their employment with Warren
County.

 

The FOP vigorously objects to this proposal. It argues
that the County provided no evidence to support this change,

nor acost analysis of the existing benefit or potential

 

savings. It notes that any benefit from this proposal will not
inure to the County until 25 years from now. Further, the FOP,
citing the testimony of its witnesses, contends that eliminating
retiree health benefits would create a major disincentive in

recruiting new correction officers and would encourage

correction officers to leave for other departments that do
90

provide for such retiree health benefits; thus, creating a
turnover problem. Both FOP witnesses testified that a
constant turnover of staff degrades the ability of officers to do
their jobs and degrades their ability to provide services to
Warren County. Therefore, the FOP argues, ending retiree
benefits would have a major negative impact on the continuity
and stability of employment and should be denied

The County has not provided any data about the cost of
retirees’ health benefits. While it almost goes without saying
that health benefits are a significant expense to the County, that
generic assumption is insufficient to justify this proposal
Further, I note that no law enforcement group in the County has

yet accepted this plan, so it certainly cannot be said that a

 

pattern of internal comparability exists.

If I were to award the County’s proposal to eliminate all

 

health benefits for future employees, consequences would
inevitably result. For one, correction officers are now

contractually eligible to re

 

e from PFRS after 25 years of
service to the County, with paid health benefits. Often,
correction officers are eligible to retire in their 50's or even
40's. Employees not having health care through another source
would be discouraged from retiring, and would simply continue to
work to maintain health benefits. Second, I agree with the FOP

that the elimination of retiree health benefits would put the
1

County at a competitive disadvantage in recruiting and retaining
quality correction officers, especially in light of the fact that
most New Jersey law enforcement groups have such a benefit,
including the sheriff's officers of the same Warren County
sheriff's department, ‘The County would again be squandering
training money on recruits only to have them leave for other
departments were the benefit is offered. Therefore, I find that
this proposal is not in the public interest, and does not foster
unit stability and continuity. The County has not justified this
proposal, and it is not awarded herein

Vacancy Postings

The Employer seeks to add a new provision to Article

22, “Miscellaneous Provisions” at Section 5, which would

state,

All vacancies and filling of vacancies shall be
posted by the administration.

 

This section as presently written provides that:

The filling of all vacancies (whether special jobs,
regular shifts, or otherwise), if the qualifications
of applicants are equal, then seniority shall govern.

; The County shall provide seven days’ notice of the
filling of a vacancy by posting a notice of same, but
only in the event the County is aware of the need for
the filling of a vacancy at least seven days in
advance of same.

It appears that the contract as presently written only

requires the employer to provide notice that the vacancy
92

was filled, not to post the vacancy before it is filled.
Therefore, this language appears to clarify and enhance the
notification to employees of a vacancy. The FOP poses no
specific argument in objecting to this proposal.

This proposal will insure that correction officers are
aware of vacancies as they occur and before they are
filled. Therefore, it enhances employee working conditions
and morale, and reduces dissent after vacancies are already

filled. I therefore award this amended language change.
93

AWARD

 

I award the following:
1, Term of Agreement: January 1, 2011 through December 31, 2013.
2. Salary Increases:

a. Increase salaries for officers at the top step of the
salary guide by 2.0% effective July 1, 2011; 2.0% effective July
1, 2012; and 2.0% effective July 1, 2013.

b. Effective September 23, 2013, add a new recruit step of
$38,000, to be known as step 1.

c. Effective September 23, 2013, add a new step 9 of
$65,675. Former step 9 will now be step 10 at $73,049. The

resulting salary guide is as follows:

 

2010 ‘7/4/i1 | 7/1/12 | 7/1/13 | 9/23/13

Employees currently at step 8 will move to the new step 9 upon
receipt of their next increment. Employees currently at step 9

will retain the same dollar value as their current step which
94

will now be known as step 10. No employee will be reduced in

pay as a result of implementation of this salary guide.

3

Longevity: Longevity payments will be increased

retroactively to January 1, 2011 pursuant to the following

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

schedule:
New Longevity Amounts
2011 | 2012 | 2013 |
5 Years' Service 40g | 416 | 424
10 Years' Service 1020 | 1040 | 1061
4. Increments: Modify the contract language concerning

increments as follows:

an interest arbitration salary cap is still in
effect as of January 1, 2014, Officers who are not at
top step in 2013 will not move to the next step in the
guide in 2014 until the parties finalize a successor
agreement though negotiations or through interest
arbitration. Those officers will then move, if
applicable, pursuant to the terms of the successor
agreement. If the 2014 step movement cost does not
exceed any interest arbitration salary cap in effect

1, 2014, upon mutual agreement by the

 

 

 

parties, those officers in the guide shall receive
step increment in 2014 prior to resolving the

successor agreement.

Emergency/Storm Days: Replace the contract language in

Article 8, Section 4, with the following:

Section 4:
A Storm Day or Emergency requiring the closure of
County offices shall mean only an official declaration
of same made by the Board of Chosen Freeholders or the
County Administrator and shall not include those
declared by the State of New Jersey or those
promulgated by the Warren County Department of Public

 
95

Safety, Office of Emergency Management. For purposes
of this Agreement, a Storm Day or Emergency declared
by the Board of Chosen Freeholders or County
Administrator shall be memorialized by memorandum to
be filed with and retained by the Finance Department,
Payroll and shall include starting and ending dates
and times of the closure of County offices.

Non-Essential Employees
Should an employee report for work and subsequently

the Employer decide to officially close the Employer's
offices for any reason, such employees that report to
work shall be credited for the day's work. Should the
Employer for any reason officially close the
Employer's offices before the start of the workday,
all employees scheduled to work that day will be
credited with a day’s work.

Essential Employees:
Essential employees shall be paid double time for each

hour worked by them during a Storm Day or Emergency
when officially declared by the Board of Chosen
Freeholders or County Administrator. The double time
shall be earned for all hours worked during the entire
period of an officially declared storm or emergency.

 

the event an essential employee cannot report for
work because of storm conditions or emergency
conditions, the time lost from work will be charged
against accumulated vacation or personal leave time.
In the event that no such leave time is available, the
time lost from work will be charged as time off
without pay. If an essential employee is unable to
report to work, the employee must report this absence
no less than one and one-half (1 %) hours before the
starting time of their shift or the start of their
normal workday.

Determination as to which employees are essential and
which are non-essential may vary given the
circumstances of such event leading to the issuance of
an official declaration of a storm day or emergency.
Department/division heads are given authority to
determine classification of essential and non-
essential employees. At minimum, essential employees
shail always include those necessary to maintain
statutory or code-related mandated minimum staffing
96

levels at Warren County's 24-hour institutions/
operations.

 

Non-Essential and Essential Employees with Previous]:
Approved Leave of Absence

 

 

During any officially declared storm day or emergency,
employees absent from work for a previously approved
leave of absence, paid or unpaid, shall remain in such
status. These may include vacation leave, personal
leave, sick leave, workers’ compensation leave,
FMLA/FLA leave, disciplinary leave. In the event that
an essential employee with a previously approved leave
of absence is available to report for work, is called
out by their Department/Division head and does report
for work, such employee shall be paid as described in
this Agreement and the previously approved leave time
shall be credited to the employee’s leave time
balances.

 

Leave Approval: Modify Article 11, Section 9 by
replacing the words “department head” with “supervisor” in

the second and third sentences.

 

Vacancy Postings: Add the following new provision to

Article 22, at Section 5:

 

All vacancies and filling of vacancies shall be posted
by the Administration.

 

All proposals previously agreed upon by the parties as
recited above, shall be incorporated into the successor
agreement. All proposals by the County and the FOP not
awarded herein are denied and dismissed. All provisions of

the existing agreements shall be carried forward except

 

for those which have been modified by the terms of this

Award and/or agreed to by the parties as reflected herein.
7

Pursuant to N.J.S.A. 34:13A-16(f£), I certify that I have

 

taken the statutory limitation imposed on the local tax levy
cap into account in making the award. My Award also explains

how the statutory criteria factored into my

 

nal

determination.

On September 5, I conducted an interest arbitration hearing
at the County Administration Building. The County and FOP each

the financial impact of their respective economic proposals.

The County offered the testimony of Financial Analyst Vijay

The County also proposed to freeze step movement on the guide
for the length of the contract. These proposals combined would
have the net effect of requiring most unit employees to
retroactively reimburse the County for step increases already
paid in 2011, 2012, and 2013.

At the hearing, the County amended its Final Offer on the
record to propose that employees would be permitted to keep
salary step increments previously paid (in January 2011, 2012,
and 2013) but to eliminate future salary step movements. The
County also proposed a zero increase in step values for the life
of the contract. Further, it proposed to eliminate contract

language providing for increases in Section 2 and renumber the
remaining sections.?
Article 8: Overtime

Section 4: Emergency Closings - revise language as
follows:

A Storm Day or Emergency requiring the closure of
County offices shall mean only an official declaration
of same made by the Board of Chosen Freeholders or the
County Administrator and shall not include those
declared by the State of New Jersey or those
promulgated by the Warren County Department of Public
Safety, Office of Emergency Management. For purposes
of this Agreement, a Storm Day or Emergency declared
by the Board of Chosen Freeholders or County
Administrator shall be memorialized by memorandum to
be filed with and retained by the Finance Department,
Payroll and shall include starting and ending dates
and times of the closure of County offices.

 

lon-Essential Employees:
Should an employee report for work and subsequently
the Employer decide to officially close the Employer's
offices for any reason, such employees that report to
work shall be credited for the day’s work. Should the
Employer for any reason officially close the
Employer's offices before the start of the workday,
all employees scheduled to work that day will be
credited with a day's work.

 

Essential Employees
Essential employees shall be paid double time for each

hour worked by them during a Storm Day or Emergency
when officially declared by the Board of Chosen
Freeholders or County Administrator. The double time
shall be earned for all hours worked during the entire
period of an officially declared storm or emergency.

 

In its brief, the Employer again proposed salary reductions of 3.75% in
2011 and 2% salary increases in 2012 and 2013 respectively, consistent with
the chart above. To the extent that the Employer is now seeking to amend
its Final Offer again, this amendment is not allowed. N. 34:13A-16
only permits amendments of Final Offers up until the beginning of the
arbitration hearing.

 

 

  
In the event an essential employee cannot report for
work because of storm conditions or emergency
conditions, the time lost from work will be charged
against accumulated vacation or personal leave time.
In the event that no such leave time is available, the
time lost from work will be charged as time off
without pay. If an essential employee is unable to
report to work, the employee must report this absence
no less than one and one-half (1 %) hours before the
starting time of their shift or the start of their
normal workday.

Determination as to which employees are essential and
which are non-essential may vary given the
circumstances of ach event leading o the issuance of
an official declaration of a storm day or emergency.
Department/division heads are given authority to
determine classification of essential and non-
essential employees. At minimum, essential employees
shall always include those necessary to maintain
statutory or code-related mandated minimum staffing
levels at Warren County’s 24-hour institutions/
operations.

Non-Essential and Essential Employees with Previously
Approved Leave of Absenc

 

 

During any officially declared storm day or emergency,
employees absent from work for a previously approved
leave of absence, paid or unpaid, shall remain in such
status. These may include vacation leave, personal
leave, sick leave, workers’ compensation leave,
FMLA/FLA leave, disciplinary leave. In the event that
an essential employee with a previously approved leave
of absence is available to report for work, is called
out by their Department/Division head and does report
for work, such employee shall be paid as described in
this Agreement and the previously approved leave time
shall be credited to the employee’s leave time
balances.

BACKGROUND FACTS

Demographics

Warren County is located in the far, northwestern edge of
the State and borders on the Delaware River at the Delaware
River Water Gap. It is bordered by Sussex County to the North,
Morris County to the East and Hunterdon County to the South.
These four counties, in addition to Somerset County, make up the
“skylands Region” of New Jersey.

The historic patterns of development for Warren County have

been established based on the geography of the area and the

   

transportation system. Route 46/Route 80 runs east and
west through the middle of the County. North of Route 46/Route

80 is marked by rugged slopes and relatively shallow soils over
12

bedrock, which discouraged the early development of
transportation, agriculture and economic development. South of
Route 46, broader valleys encouraged development, specifically
for agricultural areas with markets for farm products in the
Newark and New York metropolitan areas. The major population
centers today are Phillipsburg, Hackettstown, Washington and
Belvidere, which is the County seat. (E-2, p.58; E-23)

In the 1960’s there was an increase in development activity
when marginal farms were sold to land developers, particularly
in the northern part of the County. The completion of
Interstate 78 in the 1980’s led to additional housing and
commercial development. The Merrill Creek Reservoir, a 1.1
square mile reservoir built by a consortium of seven regional

electric companies, is now the largest tax-paying entity in the

 

County and includes a 290-acre nature preserve and a visitor's
center that are open to the public. (E-23)

Of the four counties in the northwestern section in the

 

Skylands area, i.e. Morris, Sussex, Warren, and Hunterdon,
(highlighted in the chart below), Warren County has the lowest

population:

In addition, the Employer points out that Warren County's
unemployment rate as projected for June 2013, is 6.9% as
compared with the fourteen counties in northern Jersey of 8.2%
and as compared with the Allentown-Bethlehem-Easton MSA OF 7.8%.
(E-2, p. 58)

The County asserts that Warren County is part of the
Allentown-Bethlehem-Easton Metropolitan Statistical Area (MSA)
and therefore, the Pennsylvania Counties of Northampton, Monroe,
Carbon, Luzerne, and Lackawanna should all be considered as

relevant data for the purposes of comparing cost-of-living,
16

economic data, salaries and benefits. It also seeks comparison
with the fourteen New Jersey counties comprising “North Jersey”.

The Union argues that the Pennsylvania counties are, in
essence, “farm counties”, have no relevance to Warren County for
purposes of analysis, and should be given no weight. The FOP
notes that, pursuant to the “New Jersey First” statute enacted
in 2011, New Jersey public employees are required to maintain
residence in New Jersey. However, the Employer counters that
this same statute grandfathered employees already living in
Pennsylvania at the time of its passage and emphasizes that
about 208 of Warren County employees continue to live in
Pennsylvania. The Union proffers, for purposes of comparison,
the wage and benefit data of correction officers in eighteen of
the twenty-one New Jersey counties where data was available and
contends that this is the fairest and most relevant data for
comparative analysis.

I have considered both parties’ arguments with regard to
this issue. I have assigned little relevance to demographic
data and salary and benefit data for Lackawanna, Luzerne and
Carbon Counties, as these counties are geographically remote
from Warren County. For instance, Hazleton, on the border of
Carbon and Luzerne Counties, is approximately seventy miles from
Belvidere. It is unlikely that Warren County correction

office

 

s would be living in these three remote counties. On the
v7

other hand, I find that southern New Jersey counties (south of
Route 195) may be given only slight weight in considering
comparative data for salaries and benefits. These counties are
also too geographically remote from Warren County and are
certainly not within “commuting distance” for a Warren County
correction officer. I consider the most relevant group for
purposes of comparison to be those counties contiguous to
Warren; that is the New Jersey counties of Sussex, Morris and
Hunterdon, and the two Pennsylvania counties - Monroe and
Northampton. I intend to give greater weight to data from New
Jersey counties, as at least 30% of Warren County's correction
officers both live and work in New Jersey.
Organization of the Department

The Warren County Correctional Center is an adult
correctional facility used to detain adult offenders.
Correction officers are responsible for the safety, welfare, and
control of all inmates and the Correctional Center’s employees.
In July of 2011, the Warren County Board of Chosen Freeholders
assigned the care, custody, and control of the correctional
center to the Warren County Sheriff. The Correctional Center is
under the direct supervision of Warden Robert Brothers, a twenty-
five year veteran of corrections.

Currently the daily population averages between 145 and 155

male and female adult offenders, in addition to 20 adult
18

offenders on the Labor Assistance Program, and up to 6 adults and
6 juvenile offenders on the Electronic Monitoring Program.

The Correctional Center is a podular design and is operated
as both a remote and a direct supervision facility. Inmates are
classified upon entry to determine the level of supervision
that is required. Inmates are housed in minimum, medium, and
maximum security housing areas.

STATUTORY CRITERI:

 

I am required to make a reasonable determination of the

above issues giving due weight to those factors set forth in

 

 

34:13A-16g(1) through (9) that I find relevant to the
resolution of these negotiations. These factors, commonly
called the statutory criteria, are as follows:

(1) The interests and welfare of the public. Among the
items the arbitrator or panel of arbitrators shall
assess when considering this factor are the
limitations imposed upon the employer by (P.L.
1976, c. 68 (C. 40A:4-45.1 et seq.).

(2) Comparison of the wages, salaries, hours, and
conditions of employment of the employees involved
in the arbitration proceedings with the wages,
hours, and conditions of employment of other
employees performing the same or similar services
and with other employees generally:

(a) In private employment in general;
provided, however, each party shall
have the right to submit additional
evidence for the arbitrator's
consideration.

(b) In public employment in general;
provided, however, each party shall
(3)

(6)

19

have the right to submit additional
evidence for the arbitrator's
consideration,

(c) In public employment in the same or
similar comparable jurisdictions, as
determined in accordance with section
5 of P.L. 1995. c. 425 (C.34:13A-16.2)
provided, however, each party shal
have the right to submit additional
evidence concerning the comparability
of jurisdictions for the arbitrator's
consideration.

   

The overall compensation presently received by
the employees, inclusive of direct wages,
salary, vacations, holidays, excused leaves,
insurance and pensions, medical and
hospitalization benefits, and all other economic
benefits received.

Stipulations of the parties.

The lawful authority of the employer. Among the
items the arbitrator or panel of arbitrators
shall assess when considering this factor are
the limitations imposed upon the employer by the
1976 c. 68 (C.40A:4-45 et seq).

 

The financial impact on the governing unit, its
residents and taxpayers. When considering this
factor in a dispute in which the public employer
is a county or a municipality, the arbitrator or
panel of arbitrators shall take into account to
the extent that evidence is introduced, how the
award will affect the municipal or county
purposes element, as the case may be, of the
local property tax; a comparison of the
percentage of the municipal purposes element,

or in the case of a county, the county purposes
element, required to fund the employees’
contract in the preceding local budget year with
that required under the award for the current
local budget year; the impact of the award for
each income sector of the property taxpayers on
the local unit; the impact of the award on the
ability of the governing body to (a) maintain

 
20

existing local programs and services, (b) expand
existing local programs and services for which
public moneys have been designated by the
governing body in a proposed local budget, or
(c) initiate any new programs and services for
which public moneys have been designated by the
governing body in its proposed local budget.

(7) The cost of living.

(8) The continuity and stability of employment
including seniority rights and such other
factors not confined to the foregoing which are
ordinarily or traditionally considered in the
determination of wages, hours and conditions of
employment through collective negotiations and
collective bargaining between the parties in the
public service and in private employment.

(9) Statutory restrictions imposed on the employer.
Among the items the arbitrator or panel of
arbitrators shall assess when considering this
factor are the limitations imposed upon the
employer by section 10 of P.L. 2007, c. 62
(C.40A: 4-45.45).

In arriving at the terms of this award, I conclude that

all of the statutory factors are relevant, but not all are

 

entitled to equal weight. It is widely acknowledged that in
most interest arbitration proceedings, no single factor can be
determinative when fashioning the terms of an award. This
observation is present here as judgments are required as to
which criteria are more significant and as to how the relevant
evidence is to be weighed.

In addition, I note that N.J.S.A. 34:13A-16g(8) requires

consideration of those factors ordinarily or traditionally

considered in the determination of wages, benefits, and
21

employment conditions. One such consideration is that the
party proposing a change in an employment condition bears the
burden of justifying the proposed change. Another
consideration is that any decision to award or deny any
individual issue in dispute, especially those having economic

impact, will include consideration as to the reasonableness of

 

that individual issue in relation to the terms of the entire

 

award. I am also required by statute to determine the total
net annual economic cost of the terms required by the Award.
In this matter, the interests and welfare of the public
must be given the most weight. It is a criterion that
embraces many other factors and recognizes the
interrelationships among all of the statutory criteria. Among
the other factors that interrelate and require the greatest
scrutiny in this proceeding are the financial impact of the
award, the restrictions on the employer by the appropriations
cap and the tax levy caps, the comparison of wages, other
compensation and benefits of Warren County’s correction
officers to other similar jurisdictions, and the cost of living

and the wages and settlements within Warren County's workforce.

 

ANALYSIS

Term of Agreemen

Each party has proposed a three-year agreement to cover
22

the period January 1, 2011 through December 31, 2013.

Accordingly, I award a three-year agreement.

Salaries, Increments, Longevity, Step Guide Revisions:

 

The County has already paid step increases due employees
each January for 2011, 2012, and 2013. The County's offer, as
modified at hearing, is to permit employees who are moving
through the step guide to keep the increment money they have
already been paid and to maintain the existing salary guide from
2010. That is, the County proposes a freeze on the salary guide
with no across-the-board increases for the life of the contract.

The County also offers to increase clothing and maintenance

 

allowance by 2% in each year of the contract. In addition, it
offers to increase longevity pay by 28 in each year of the
contract. Going forward, the County demands that the increment
plan be eliminated and that no employee would receive step
increases in future years beyond contract expiration.

The County argues that Chapter 105, P.L. of 2010,
imposed a 2% cap on arbitration awards for all contracts
expiring on or after January 1, 2011. ‘The County contends
that this statute applied to contracts that expire on or
after the effective date of the law. It asserts that its
2008-2010 contract with the FOP expired on January 1, 2011

and that therefore, the 2% cap on increases to total base
23

 

s

 

salaries applies to this matter ( 34:13A-16.7). It
maintains that the legislature could not have intended that
public employers and unions whose contracts expired at
midnight on December 31, 2010 would not be subject to the
28 cap.

The County argues that the Union’s proposal of 1.5%

increases every six months for the life of the contract is

 

unprecedented during difficult economic times, but is
on top of already paid median salary increases of 22.2%
received by employees progressing through the step guide.
It points out that step movement is part of the overall
compensation package and must be given due weight as part
of the financial impact on the governing body and its tax
payers. It points to Article 7, Section 2, of the parties’
2008-2010 contract requires the arbitrator to consider the
cost of step movements as part of the overall compensation
of these employees and to give due weight to the financial
impact on the County and the taxpayers by virtue of these
costs.

The County asserts that once the cost of step movement
is factored in to the overall compensation package, there
can be no other result but to freeze the pay scale at all

steps for all three years of the contract.
24

The County notes that the step guide was first awarded
by Arbitrator Glasson in 2003 as a way to stem the high
turnover being experienced by the jail in the years
preceding that award. As the Union's witnesses testified,
turnover is now virtually nonexistent. The County
therefore asserts that the elimination of automatic step
movement will have no impact on employee turnover going
forward as wages are stagnant, unemployment is high, and
revenue is declining. Further, the County maintains that
the elimination of the step guide consumed substantially
more than the annual 2% increase in overall compensation
imposed by caps and more than the County offered to this
bargaining unit.

The Employer asserts that it is faced with

uw

   

precedented fiscal challenges and unforgiving levy and
spending caps which are making it extremely difficult for
the County to maintain the same level of services and
employee headcount. It most particularly cites the Warren
Haven Nursing Home with a $4.0 million annual operating
loss as the primary source of its fiscal difficulties.
Despite the County’s efforts to cut taxes to stimulate the
economy, tax rates have actually increased to make up the

shortfall caused by falling property values and shortfalls

in other revenue, More specifically the County avers that
25

the tax levy caps and appropriations cap has greatly
restricted the County's ability to raise revenue via
taxation which in turn has a substantial impact on the
amount of money available for pay raises for correction
officers, or for any other County employee.

The County also cites its costs of pension and health
benefit payments as placing an enormous financial burden on
the County. It notes that the employee contributions as
mandated by Chapter 78 do not result in a windfall to the

County but only reduces the overall costs for health

 

benefits by a small amount. It notes that there is no
provision in N.J.S.A, 34:13A-15 to credit savings from
employee health care contributions to employee salaries.

The Employer argues that, to the extent cost
containment can be achieved through reductions in labor
contracts, that the 2% cap on salaries should be applied
here even if not statutorily mandated. Containing the
growth of overall compensation at or below the 2% level is
the County’s goal, including payment of increments.

The County contends that its correction officers are

already competitively paid as compared with correction

 

officers in other jurisdictions and New Jersey's private
sector employees. The County highlights that the last

contract (2008-2010) awarded correction officers 6.0%
26

annual increases in both 2009 and 2010. It emphasizes that
the median cash compensation of a bargaining member was
$61,633 in 2011, far greater than the median cash
compensation for a New Jersey resident over age 25 with a
high school education. Therefore, the County argues
adoption of its Final Offer would only have a positive
impact on the continuity and stability of employment for
correction officers. The County contends, “In these
difficult economic times, it is difficult to imagine that
correction officers would leave the security of a well-
paying job with extremely good health care and pension
benefits, for another job, whether in the private sector or
the public sector”,

The County argues that the statutory cap restrictions
and the interest and welfare of the public dictate that the
County's offer must be awarded. It notes that Warren
County's fiscal condition has been affected by the national
and state economies, as well as other fiscal pressures. It
also notes that the national unemployment rate, as of July
2013 was 7.4%, while Warren County’s unemployment rate as
of December 2012, was also 7.4%. It adds that the cost of
health care premiums rose nationally by 104.3% over the
past decade and that pension-funding pressures continue to

increase as the “baby boomer generation” requires
7

additional years of benefit payments to be made to more
retirees.

Further, the County points out that its tax revenues
decreased by $1.55 million, or 2.27%, from 2008 to 2012, thus,
straining the County budget. Because Warren County is located
in the Highlands Preservation area, increased development within
the County is severely limited, and in turn, limits the
potential for increased property tax revenues. Also
significantly impacting the County's tax revenues is the fact
that County equalized valuation has declined by 13.18 since
2008. Thus, in order to raise the same amount of tax revenues,
the County has had to increase tax rates. Therefore, in order
to meet expenses, the County has had to resort to using surplus

funds to balance its budget. In 2013, the County has had to use

 

surplus funds to offset its $3.5 million budget gap. It
contends that any increases above and beyond the step increments
already paid will only further add to its budgetary strains and

its ability to provide services at Warren Haven Nursing Home.

 

In summary, the County argues its offer provides a
reasonable and generous compensation package for correction
officers in a weakened economy, given the nature of fiscal
constraints that have been imposed by the County.

The FOP observes that it signed a tentative agreement with

the County in May, 2012 which was then rejected by the Board of
28

Freeholders. The FOP’s final offer before me, in essence,
mirrors that agreement. It seeks a three-year contract, with
split increases of 1.5% to top step only, each January and again
in July, in each year of the contract. It also seeks to roll
the longevity benefit into the contract at top step, effective
with the date of the award. Going forward, it proposes to add
an extra step between step 8 and step 9 of the salary guide and
create a new recruit step of $38,000. The remainder of the
contract would continue as is except for provisions previously
agreed upon between the parties, as noted above.

The FOP argues that the 2012 agreement “struck a careful
balance between capping costs and continuing a stable workforce
in the county correctional facility.” It asserts that awarding
the terms of this agreement would both serve the interests of
the public and the interest of both parties.

The FOP highlights that the County Corrections Department is
an integral part of the law enforcement community within the
County of Warren and beyond. Its multifaceted services
compliment the operations of other law enforcement entitles in
the County, including the transport of inmates, arrests and
execution of warrants, It maintains that the exceptional level
of services provided by the correctional personnel are not
matched by compensation or working conditions. It contends that

these employees work in some of the most difficult and challenging
29

work environments.

It asserts that the integration of services and joint
operations with local jurisdictions dictates that a proper
universe of comparison of salaries and benefits is local
comparison and internal comparison to the Prosecutor’s
detectives and Warren’s corrections superiors. It argues that
the Employer's comparisons are inappropriate, as it relied upon
“farm counties" in a different state and, absent a description
of the workload and nature of service provided by those other
jurisdictions, they should not be given any weight.

The FOP contends that Warren County’s correction officers
rank among the lowest paid of all law enforcement in the
State, It offers a chart, taken from my interest arbitration

award in Hudson County Department of Corrections, I.A. No.

 

2012-46, p. 46. (FOP-E).* This chart depicts the top pay for
correction officers in 18 of the 21 counties. The average top
base pay for correctional officers for 2010, (the last year of
the Warren FOP contract), was $75,429. The FOP maintains that
this is far below the 2010 base salary of Warren County
officers which is $68,836. Further, the FOP argues that the
review of settlement and interest arbitration awards reported

by the New Jersey Public Employment Relations Commission

 

The data comprising this chart included in the Hudson award was provided by
parties to that matter. While the Hudson County parties were bound by the
accuracy of the data, the parties in this matter are not.
30

(E-25) shows that the average salary increase granted in
interest arbitration awards and those units that voluntarily
settled was 2.178. ‘The FOP contends that it is merely requesting
a raise slightly higher than the most recent statewide
averages, considering that these unit employees are underpaid and
rank very low in terms of State averages.

As to comparison with other Warren County law enforcement
units, the FOP points out that the County corrections superior
officers received a 2% across-the-board salary increase and
enjoyed cash in pocket raises between $1,639 to $1,959.
Further, the top step investigator in the Prosecutors Office
received $93,217 in 2012 and received a 2% salary increase to
$95,081 in 2013. The FOP argues that this $1,864 raise is even more
than the annual increases ranging from $1,556 to $1,685 as
proposed by the FOP. It notes that, as testified to by both
President Lovenberg and Vice-President Bowlby, correction
officers perform many of the same duties performed by other law
enforcement officers, including transportation of inmates,
arrests, and execution of warrants. Like other county law
enforcement personnel, they are fully trained in firearms on
an annual basis, must carry firearms while off duty, and wear
protective vests while on duty. Therefore, internal comparisons
with those County law enforcement personnel form the best basis
for comparison of wages and salary increases. The FOP offers

a comparative chart which shows that the top pay for sheriff's
a1

officers in 2011 was $68,556 as compared with correction
officers’ current top pay of $68,386. It also shows that if
the FOP’s raises were awarded together with the roll-in of
longevity, as proposed, their new top pay by the end of the
contract period would $76,753 -- more than $5,300 above that
of sheriff's officers.

It is the position of the FOP that comparisons with the
non-law enforcement personnel should not be given any
significant weight as the best comparisons are with other law
enforcement units commonly situated. Due to the unique
statutory obligation and treatment of police officers under New
Jersey Law, any comparison to private sector employees must
result in a strong justification for significantly higher
compensation to be paid to correction officers. The
distinguishing characteristics of a corrections officer, as
compared with a private sector worker, include: the obligation
to be armed and to act in the event of a crime while off-duty at
all times and anywhere in New Jersey; the absence of portability
of one’s pension and job skills to other areas of the country;
the inherent hazardous nature of the work environment; the
application of different standards under the Fair Labor
Standards Act for the treatment of overtime; the absence
of coverage under the New Jersey State Wage and Hour Law;

corrections departments are regulated by specific statutorily
32

set rules and regulations, powers and duties, and the
delegation of authority; qualifications for employment are
statutorily mandated and include citizenship, New Jersey
residency, minimum and maximum age and fitness requirements, and
a clean criminal history record; the mandatory retirement age is
65; employment may be forfeited after five days absence without
just cause; promotional examinations are statutorily required
for certain classes of corrections officers; hiring criteria
and order of preference is set by statute; and corrections
officer pensions are not covered by the federal ERISA Pension
Protection Act. Further, correction officers are subject to
unique, statutorily created hearing procedures for disciplinary
charges; they must undergo basic training at the Corrections
Academy and must regularly re-qualify in firearms; they are
required to wear protective vests at all times while on duty:
and most importantly, they have an obligation to act as a law
enforcement officer at all times of the day, both on and off-
duty, including full arrest powers while off duty anywhere in
New Jersey.

The FOP contends that the greatest weight must be given to
the comparison of the employees in this dispute with other
employees performing the same or similar services and with
other employees generally in public employment in the same or

similar, comparable jurisdictions. The FOP asserts,
33

Correcticns officers are a local labor market
occupation. The farther from the locality, the weaker
the validity of the comparison. Corrections
comparisons are strongest in the local area, such as
contiguous towns, a county, an obvious geographic area
such as the shore or a metropolitan area.
The FOP argues that such a comparison shows that Warren County's
correction officers are comparatively underpaid and below
average and therefore, awarding of its proposal is necessary to
bring these up to average pay for the area.
The FOP calculates that the cost of requested salary

increases for the three-year award would be as follows:

2011: 12 top-step officers x $1,556 = $18,672
2012: 14 top-step officers x $1,634 = $22,876
2013: 18 top-step officers x $1,685 = $30,330

These amounts take into consideration the FOP's proposed roll-in
of longevity into base salary in 2012 in the amount of $1,400.
The FOP notes that the cost of a 1.5% split raise is
significantly less than a flat percentage tobe applied in the
beginning of the year due to the salary increases being
gradually faced in. For instance, in 2011, the total yearly
cost per member would be $1,032 in the first half of the year and
$524 in the second half of the year, for a grand total of
$1,556. The FOP argues that this compares to the corrections
superior officers who received 2% across-the-board salary

increases in 2011, 2012 and 2013. A corrections sergeant, the
34

employee most closely related to a top-pay correction officer,
received $1,636 in 2011, $1,639 in 2012 and $1,671 in 2013.

Accordingly the salary increases for sergeants was almost
identical to that proposed by the FOP here. Additionally, the
Prosecutors detectives received a $1,864 increase in 2013 --
more than what is being proposed by the FOP in this matter.
In addition, the FOP observes that the sheriffs’ officers
received a 2% increase across the board in all steps.

The FOP argues that the County has the ability to pay
the salary increases demanded here. It notes that County
Financial Officer Charles Houck testified that there was
plenty of flexibility in the current budget to allow for a
salary increase to be awarded to correctional officers.
In particular, the overall Corrections budget for salaries
has increased from 2011 to 2013 in the following amounts:
$5,236,864 in 2011, $5,380,121 in 2012, and $5,389,534 in 2013.
While these were the appropriated amounts, the County did not
have to use the full amount appropriated and only paid
$5,017,745 in 2012 and $4,994,915 in 2011 which resulted in
salary surpluses of $362,375 in 2012 and a $241,948 surplus in
2011. (E-16)

Further, the FOP emphasis that, according to Houck, it will

be very likely, absent an extraordinary emergency, that there
would again be a reserve or surplus in 2013. The total costs

for corrections’ salaries declined from 2010 to 2013 from
35

$3,734,841 in 2012 to $3,560,029 in 2013. W-3) Accordingly,
the County will spend $174,812 less in the cost of salaries for
2013 even though it appropriated more money in 2013 for such
salaries.

The FOP argues that, the County has already determined that
it has an ability to pay the salary increase as proposed by the
FOP when it reached an agreement with the FOP on May 7, 2012 to
afford split 1.5% increases in January and July of the years
2011, 2012 and 2013. (FOP-A)

Further, the FOP notes that the County has reduced its tax
levy for 2009, 2010 and 2011. As indicated by the County
Financial Analyst Dan Olfshefski, Warren County has the
lowest amount of debt in any County of the State.

As to the cost of living, the FOP argues that these
correction officers are at Tier 3 of health care
contributions and therefore are contributing 21.75% of
premiums for single coverage and 14.25% for family
coverage this year. In addition, Chapter 78 raised the
pension contribution for FOP unit members from 8.5% of
salary to 10% of salary. Such contributions mark a
significant reduction in take home pay for corrections
officers.

As to the factor of internal comparability, the FOP argues
that this factor that is not only specifically addressed in

the statutory criteria N.J.S.A. 34:13a-16g (2) (c) but also has
36

been found to fall within the criteria of the interest and
welfare of the public in the continuity and stability of
employment. The Public Employment Relations Commission has
recognized the importance of considering internal comparability
and its controlling case law on interest arbitration. The
arbitrator should give considerable weight to both internal
and external comparisons. Comparing the wages and benefits of

this bargaining ur

 

with other correctional groups State-wide
shows that Warren County is significantly underpaid and
below average.
Budget

The County’s budget message for 2013 (E-18) states that
declining revenue in all areas of their budget has increased
financial strain on the County. It goes on to state that Warren
County has the distinction of being located in the middle of the
Highlands Preservation and Planning area. This distinction has
the impact of nearly zero economic growth for the County and in
addition, severely hinders the County’s potential for
development that could improve its declining revenue sources.

The Board of Freeholders has a 2013 budget that addresses
past surplus spending, pays for current services, and plans for
the future without requiring more money from the taxpayers of
Warren County. The 2013 operating budget, exclusive of State

and federal grant-funded appropriations and capital improvement
37

projects, increased 0.3% or $300,000 from the prior year budget.
(B-18)

The County has attempted to ease its tax burdens while
maintaining critical services through the use of County surplus
funds; and without significantly reducing comparable expenses.
According to the Budget Message, the County has a current budget
deficit of more than $3.5 million dollars along with a reduced,
non-recurring savings account. (E-18)

The most significant impact to Warren County’s revenues is
due to reduced revenue receipts for the County-owned nursing
home, Warren Haven. Because of reductions in Medicare/Medicaid
reimbursement rates, revenues have decreased $3.5 million and
Warren Haven, therefore has a current overall budget deficit of
$2.4 million. Also, according to Warren County’s Chief
Financial Officer, Charles Houck, the State has decreased the
per-diem reimbursement rate for Warren Haven patients, thereby
compounding the effect of the revenue loss. Local revenues and
State Aid are down 2.2% and 3.3% respectively. The County
indicates that the State has increased the County’s cost share
for residents in State mental institutions from 10%-15%, a 50%
increase in cost. (E-18) County Budget Analyst Dan Olshefsky
testified that Warren Haven was most recently operating at an

annual loss rate of $4.0 million.
38

Houck testified that in preparing its budget, the County
cannot anticipate more in revenue than it actually received in
the prior year. Anticipated revenues for 2013 and Anticipated

and Realized revenues in 2012 are as follows:

39

The Warren County Board of Freeholders has implemented the
following initiatives to increase the County’s surplus, reduce
costs, and ease the burden on the taxpayer: (E-18; FOP-C)

- Lowering Open Space Tax from 6 cents to 4.5 cents resulting
in more than $1.7 million in reduced taxes for the County.
Board Freeholder Sarnoski states that this reduction
represents less than what has been spent on average over
the past five years and the County will still be building a
surplus in the account.

- Simultaneously collecting more for open space, farmland
preservation, and historical projects than the County has
spent on average in the last five years; and resulting in
an increased surplus in that fund by the end of 2013.

- Warren County Library Tax is not changing from 2012;
however, the opening of its new Headquarters Branch will
allow for the reduction of future costs of the library
system. Sarnoski stated that the County has seen reduced
costs in the terms of building facilities in the future as
changes have been made in usage and occupation of County
facilities.

- Instituted a “Pay As You Go” philosophy resulting in the

lowest debt of any county in New Jersey.
40

- Adopted a resolution requiring voter approval of bond debt
under certain circumstances, providing the taxpayer with
more control in the County’s spending.
- Allocated planning dollars to save for future capital
projects and capital improvements resulting in the county
moving out of deficient buildings with costly leases.
Sarnoski contends that capital projects programs are going
strong and will not require borrowing. (FOP-C; E-18)
County fiscal operations generated approximately $7.0
million in surplus revenues during 2012. Approximately $7.6
million of these funds will be utilized to balance the 2013
budget. Further, $1.1 million additional monies from the
medical trust fund will be utilized in the 2013 budget. (E-18)

Miscellaneous revenues fund 27% of the appropriations in
the 2013 operating budget. These funds decreased by $1,234,000
from the 2012 budget year. The primary source for anticipated
reduced revenues is the Warren Haven Nursing Home operation.
The fee revenue collected from the various County departments
during 2013 is not expected to increase. (E-18)

With regard to the appropriation expense side of the 2013
budget, the County has maintained operating expenses for general
government services and also reduced the size of its government.

The County states that the anticipated costs of general services
a

for 2013 is down 2.2%, public safety expenses have been reduced
by 1.2%, and its human services expenses have been reduced by
7.2%. Even with these savings, statutory and other expenses
have risen over the last year and diminished some the savings
realized. The County’s cost of insurances for budget year 2013
is up 3.8%, and utility costs have risen 2.6%. (E-18)

Personnel costs (salaries and wages) for the 2013 budget,
account for approximately 36.8% of the combined operating budget
appropriations. The Warren County Corrections’ salary budget
for 2013 ($5,389,534), represents 13.7% of the total County’s

salaries budget ($39,326,660).

 

The Board implemented a hiring freeze policy during 2008

through 2012, in which only essential vacant positions were
42

filled. (E-16; E-18) In 2011, the County appropriated
$5,236,884 for salaries and wages in the County Jail but paid
$4,994,915, leaving $241,949 in reserves. In 2012, the County
appropriated $5,380,121 for salaries and wages and paid
$5,017,746, leaving $362,375 in reserve monies for the

correction officer’s salaries. (E-16; E-18) Houck testified

 

that, absent an emergent circumstance, he not envision any

significant change in the reserve balances for the jail salaries

 

account for 2013.

In the 2013 budget, total County salaries and wage
appropriations increased $420,000 (1.0%) from the 2012 budget
year.

Expenditures for employer pension and Social Security
contributions in 2013 increased modestly $38,000 (0.48%)
primarily due to increases in the cost of mandatory
contributions for the New Jersey Public Employees’ Retirement
System (PERS) and payroll tax relating to wages. (E-18)

Warren County provides medical insurance coverage for its
eligible full-time and retired employees and their eligible
dependents through the New Jersey State Health Benefits Plan.
Yearly the plan establishes monthly premiums for each class of
single; husband and wife; parent and

employee coverage, i.e

  

dependent; and family coverage. The County is billed monthly

for the cost of the coverage provided by the plan for the
43

individual employees, based on the level of coverage provided.
Employees are required to contribute a percentage of their gross
wages toward the cost of the coverage. (E-18)

Warren County illustrates the cost of providing this

benefit below: (E-18)

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

2012 2013
Employee Medical Actual | Projected | Increase

Gross Benefit Cost 14,345,323 | 15,725,400 | 1,380,077
Less: Employee
Contributions 366,412 895,000 | 328,588
Net Benefit Cost 13,778,911 | 14,830,400 | 1,051,489

 

 

New Jersey statute provides that health benefit cost

increases in excess of 2% are excluded from the 2013 budget levy

  

cap. In 2013, of the $1,051,489 increase in health benefit
costs, $500,333 is excluded from the levy cap. (E~18)

Operating expenditure appropriations in the 2013 budget
decreased by $110,000 (0.65%) from the prior year.
Appropriations for employee medical insurance costs in 2013
increased $740,000 (5.25%) over the amounts appropriated for in
2012 (E-16). The net cost of maintaining County residents in
State mental hospitals in 2012 decreased $225,000 (43%) due to
credits applied from previous billings. (E-18)

General government program operating costs in 2013 remained
level from 2012 amounts. Department heads were asked to reduce

their 2013 operating expenditures budget requests where possible
4a

in order to offset increases in other programs. The reduction
requests were necessitated by Local Budget Law, which limits the

overall increase in the County Purpose Tax. (E-18)

 

In 2013, the Public Works/Uti ies budgets increased
$212,525 (2.8%) primarily due to expected increases in the cost
of road maintenance, motor pool costs, and maintenance repair
parts for the County’s buildings. (8-18)

Other departmental and program budget operating
expenditures remained relatively constant for 2013 or decreased
as a result of the Board’s determination to lower departmental
operating costs. (E-18)

Capital improvements funded from the 2013 budget increased
$900,000 (17.68) from 2012 levels (E-16; E-18). The County will
continue its pay-as-go philosophy to finance its ongoing and
routine capital improvement needs, such as road and bridge
maintenance, vehicle and equipment replacement and buildings and
grounds improvements. Of the increase, $700,000 is dedicated
capital savings for the anticipated future election system
replacement and courthouse renovations. The 2013 Capital
Improvement Program is essential to adequately maintain the
County's infrastructure, facilities and equipment. (E-18)

Debt service requirements will remain level in 2013. The

Freeholder Board places a high priority on reducing the County's
45

debt to minimize the financial burden on future generations.
(E-18)

Budget 8,693,737
Surplus Balance Remaining 3,495,474

 

In the 2013 Budget Message for Structural Budget
Imbalances, the County indicates its Fund Balance, as revenue,
is at risk. Further, it provides explanations as follows:
(E-18)

- The Board used $680,000 of surplus funds in excess of the
amount generated in 2012. These funds are used to balance
the budget with a tax increase that complies with the
statutory limitation. In addition, it adds that if this
practice continues it may result in unsustainable future
budget revenue shortfalls, requiring major reductions in
discretionary programs and services.

- The Board also utilized $1.2 million of rate stabilization
fund balance in the employee medical trust fund. The
surplus funds were accumulated as a result of savings

realized from favorable employee health care claims
46

experienced in prior years. The County joined the New
Jersey State Health Benefit Plan in 2009 and no longer
self-insures, therefore the surplus will not be
regenerated. When the remaining $3.5 million surplus is
depleted, the County could be forced to make significant
program and service cuts.

- It noted that the phase-in of greater employee
contributions ($328,588) to offset the substantial cost of
health care coverage will help reduce the burden on County
taxpayers in future budgets.

The following chart reflects Warren County’s Summary Total
Appropriations, Less Budgeted Anticipated Revenues, and the
Amounts to Be Raised by Taxation (County Purpose Tax) for years

2012 and 2013: (E-18)

‘Amount to be Raised by
Taxation $66,900,786 | $68,957,356

 

 

The proposed 2013 County operating budget will require
$68,957,356 in County Purpose Tax. This amount is an increase
over the 2012 generated amount. This increase is also below the

Stat

 

mandated cap laws. (E-18)
47

FOP exhibit (FOP-C), Resolution 194-13, April 10, 2013,
approved the Warren County Annual Budget and County Purpose Tax
Levy for the Fiscal Year 2013 as reflected in the above chart.
Board Freeholder Gardner stated in the resolution that even
though the tax levy has increased from the prior year, that
there is no tax increase to the public taxpayers. As reflected
in County exhibit (E-2), the County’s Board of Freeholders has
not increased its County Purpose Tax since 2008, or five years.

In the process of developing the budget, Sarnoski
emphasized that the County had to determine the best way to
address the $3.5 million deficit at the beginning of the
process, which they accomplished. He continued to state that
the County’s reliance on their surplus spending must end if the
County was to remain solvent in the future. (FOP-C)

One of the largest contributing factors to the deficit was
the Warren Haven Nursing Home operation (FOP-C). Houck
testified that the recently privatization of Warren Haven's
support services, in conjunction with a layoff of 43 County
employees effective July 1, 2013, would cut costs by $1.4
million.

During 2012, the equalized value of assessments (Tax Base)
decreased by $39,055,268 to $11,515,191,671 at year-end. The
2012 Equalized Tax Rate was 57.2 cents per $100 of Tax Base.

Given the proposed County Purpose Tax, the projected Tax Rate in
48

2013 should be $9.8 cents per $100 Equalized Assessed Valuation.
The County’s Equalized Valuation has declined by 13.7% since
2008. (B=2)

Houck testified that the Equalized Property Value (EPV) has
declined in the last three to four years. He explained that
each town has its own assessor and its own market-to-valuation
ratio. These assessments and ratios feed into the County’s
Purpose Tax rate. He testified that the declining EPV’s has
caused significant fiscal stress in the County. In addition,
federal sequestration is also causing cuts in the Housing
Assistance Payment Program (Section 8 housing) .

The chart below depicts the Equalized Valuation for Warren
County for the years 2008 through 2012: (E-1-P)

Current Working Conditions
The FOP points out that working in a correctional facility

can be stressful and dangerous. Correctional officers have a

 

gher rate of on the job injuries, largely owing to
conflicts with inmates. Officers Bowlby and Lovenberg
testified that officers often face dangerous altercations with
inmates and also the added risks of being targeted outside of
the work facilities by former inmates.

In addition, correction personnel are frequently required
to work extra shifts resulting in fatigue, low morale and

family-related problems. According to research performed by
49

the Wayne State University in 1997, suicide rates among
correctional officers are 39% higher than the rest of the

working age population. (FOP-E, p.34)

 

While correction officers are only required to possess a
high school education, they go through a rigorous training
period at the Police Academy and are required to qualify with
firearms both initially and annually. In addition, correction
officers are, by State statute, empowered to carry a weapon at
any time off duty and are required to act in the event that a
crime is permitted when they are present.

Existing Wages and Benefits

Warren County correction officers staff the County Jail on

round-the-clock shifts; officers work steady shifts on either

first, second or third shifts. Each shift includes a 30-minute

 

paid meal break. Each shift is eight hours, plus an additional
15 minutes extra per shift for muster time. Officers work four
days on, one day off; then four days on, two days off; then
three days on, two days off. The stationary shifts are 6:45 am
to 3:00 pm; 2:45 pm to 11:00 pm; and 10:45 pm to 7:00 am.

In addition to their base salary, correction officers
receive shift differential of $.35 per hour for the second shift,
$.60 per hour for the third shift, and $.75 per hour for weekend
shifts. Officers are currently paid straight time for the extra
15 minutes per shift. Correction officers who work overtime are
paid at a rate of time and one-half of the officer's base
pay. County Financial Analyst Vijay Kapoor calculated that the
portion of officers’ base wage compensation amounted to 90% of

total compensation, with the remaining 10% being paid as

 

overtime and shift differenti (B-2, p. 37) Correction
officers are also paid longevity pay of $400 after five

ted years of service, and $1,000 after completing ten

 

of service. (E+2, p, 20) In addition, correction

officers are provided an annual uniform and maintenance

 

$775 beginning with their second year of

 

service. (E-2, p. 20)
st

Officers enjoy 14 paid holidays per year. As to leave
time, officers annually receive 12 to 25 vacation days per
year depending on length of service, and 12 days’ sick leave in

the

ry first year of service, with 15 days annually
thereafter.

Officers are eligible for hospitalization, major medical,
dental, and prescription benefits after 90 days of service.
Employees are currently contributing pursuant to Chapter 78,
P.L. 2011, a percentage of premium costs in tier 3 of
contributions rates, meaning that they currently contribute
between 5.25% (for an employee at entry level step on the
salary guide) and 14.25% (officers at top pay) for family
coverage; and between 9.08 and 21.75% for single coverage.
Officers, who retire with 25 years’ service or on a disability
pension, receive retiree health benefits. If the officer is
under age 55 at the time of his retirement, (except disability)
he is required to reimburse the County for the full cost of the
health care plan. The Employer then resumes paying health care
plan costs when the retiree attains age 55. Employees also
have prescription benefits, an eye care plan and a dental plan.

Internal Comparability

PBA Local 280 represents Warren County's sheriff's

officers and sheriff's superior officers. In April 2012, the
52

employer signed an agreement with Local 280 covering the period
2009-2011. The parties agreed to salary guide step movement in
each year of the contract as well as a commitment that the
salary guide would survive the expiration of the agreement, and
that employees would move on the salary guide in 2012. The

2009-2012 conzract provided for salary increases only for

 

sheriff's officers at the top step of 3% in 2009, 3% increases
in 2010, and 3% in 2011. That agreement provided for a top
salary of $64,620 in 2009, $66,559 in 2010 and $68,556 in 2011.
Sergeants received a wage freeze for the first thirty months of
the contract and then received a 13.2% increase in July 2011.
Lieutenants also had a wage freeze for the first thirty months
of the contract which was followed by a 22.3% increase in July
2011.

On August 29, 2013, the Employer concluded negotiations
with the Sheriff's officers for 2012-14 and the parties signed
a Memorandum of Agreement. This agreement provided for a 2%
increase to all unit employees in 2012; a $1,450 increase to
all unit employees in 2013 and the elimination of the clothing

allowances concurrently therewith; ®

 

and a 2% increase in 2014.

FOP Lodge 170 represents the County’s correction

  

superiors. In April 2011, the County signed a successor
agreement with the FOP, covering 2011-2013 and providing for 2%
increases in each year of the contract.

PBA Local 331 represents the detectives and investigators
employed by the Warren County Prosecutor. In August 2012,

Local 331 and the prosecutor signed a new successor agreement

 

for 2012-2013 which included 2% increases in each year of the
new agreement. It also included step increases for each year

of the agreement as well as step increases to be effective

AFSCME represents the County’s blue and white collar unit,
which is the County’s largest bargaining unit. This unit also
includes support employees at Warren Haven and tele-
communicators. A contract signed in May, 2011, covered 2009-
2011, and provided for a 18-month wage freeze for January 1, 2009
through June 23, 2010; a 1% increase effective June 24; and a 2%
increase effective January 1, 2011. This agreement includes a
provision that employees hired after May 26, 2011 are ineligible
for post-retirement health benefits. It also includes a
provision that requires retirees under age 65 to contribute, on a
sliding scale, depending upon the pension annuity amount, a
quarterly payment for medical insurance, ranging from $66 to $303
per quarter.

On August 28, 2013, AFSCME and the County signed a
memorandum of agreement for a successor contract to cover 2012-
2015 for this unit. This agreement provided for a 1.0%
increase in 2013 and a 3.0% increase in 2014, with no increases
for 2012 or 2015. Uniform allowances were increased slightly,
and longevity was increased in 2014 to between $650 and $1,650;
and the parties also agreed to the County’s Storm and Emergency
Closing provision.

AFSCME Local 0671 represents the County’s blue and white
collar supervisory employees. On October 10, 2012, the County

signed a successor agreement with AFSCME for 2012-2014. The
55

agreement provided for a 1.5% across-the-board increase in each
year of the contract. It is noteworthy that this contract
provided that new employees hired after March 9, 2011 will be
ineligible for post-retirement medical benefits

CWA represents Warren County’s public health nurses. In

March 2013, CWA signed a successor agreement with the County

  

covering 2012-2014. The parties agreed to a 1.5% increase in
each year of the new agreement. The parties also agreed to
movement on the step guide for each year of the agreement.

CWA Loca: 1071 represents employees of the County
Department of Human Services, Division of Temporary Assistance

and Social Services ("TASS” This unit includes such job

 

categories as social workers, income maintenance workers, and
support staff.’ In August, 2011, the parties signed a
successor agreement covering 2011 through 2013. The contract
provides for a 2% salary increase in each year of the contract
The contract also includes a 12~step salary guide, and while
the contract is silent about step guide movement, I infer that
employees annually move from step to step on the guide. In
January, 2013, the parties amended the contract to include the

56

unit. The language is identical to that proposed by the County
in this matter.

CWA Local 1032 represents the clerical employees in the
County Prosecutor's office. The contract is silent on whether
employees move automatically through the salary range to reach
maximum. On September 26, 2012, the Prosecutor signed a
successor contract with CWA for 2012-2014, which provided for a
1.5% across-the-board salary increase applicable to the
minimums and maximums of the salary ranges in each year. This
unit does not have a step guide, but rather, each title is
identified with a salary “range” of minimums and maximums. In
January, 2013, this unit also signed an agreement with the
Employer concerning the Storm and Emergency Closings, which was
then appended to the contract.

The factor of internal comparability, based upon
existing agency and court precedent, is a factor that is
not only specifically addressed in the statutory criteria

(N.J.S.A. 34:13A-16g(2)(c)], but also has been found to

 

fall within the criteria of the "interests and welfare of

the public" and the "continuity and stability of

    

employment." The Public Employment Relations Commission
has recognized the importance of considering internal
comparability in its controlling case law on interest

arbitration.
57

In County of Union, P.E.R.C. No. 2003-33, 28 NJPER 459,461
(133169, 2002), the Commission stated:
Pattern is an important labor relations concept that
is relied upon by both labor and management
deviation from a settlement pattern can affect the
continuity and stability of employment by discouraging
future settlements and undermining employee morale
in other units.
An internal pattern is relevant to the "comparability"
criterion, N.J.S.A. 34:13A-169(2)(c); N.J.A.C. 19:16-
5.14(c) (5), and to the "continuity and stability of
employment" criterion, N.J.S.A. 34:13A-16g(8). Id., 28

External Comparability

As previously stated, I consider the northern counties in

the immediate area of Warren County, to be the most relevant in

terms of examining correction employees in similar
jurisdictions. The chart below shows salaries from 2009

The Union also proffered a chart showing the top pay rates
for correction officers in 18 of the 21 counties. (FOP Brief p.
13) According to the FOP’s chart, the average top pay among
correction officers statewide was $75,429 in 2010. The data

supporting the FOP’s chart was replicated from an earlier

inter

 

st arbitration award. It is noted that supporting
documentation was not supplied to support this summary chart,
but even assuming that the FOP’s summary information is
accurate, I assign little weight to this conclusion. as
explained previously, the more relevant comparable data is the
salary information of the counties in the immediate Warren

County geographic area.
59

Consumer Price Index (CPI)

The Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) cites the Chained
(C-CPI-U) as its most accurate measure of cost-of-living. The
BLS also produces indexes for local areas, including the New
York-Northern New Jersey-Long Island and NY-NJ-CT-PA

Metropolitan Area (CPI-W) cove.

  

g all urban wage earners.
While available for a longer duration and regionally focused,
the County notes that the BLS advises such areas are less
reliable due to sample size volatility. (E-2)

The County states that for the contract period of January
1, 2007 through December 31, 2010, correction officers received
across-the-board wages (compounded) totaling 12.6% and 26.7% for

officers at the maximum step. I assume that this data i

 

inclusive of increment amounts, It notes that the cumulative
wage growth of all correction officers outpaced the growth of

consumer prices of regional CPI-W and chained CPI-U from 2008

 

 

through 2010. (£-2}
The County asserts that its chart below represents the

Warren County Correction Officer wages increases versus the CPI

increase for 2007 through 2010: (E-2)

The County avers that currently the median years of service
for a correction officer in the bargaining unit are seven years
of service. Over the term of the contract period of January 1,
2007 through December 31, 2010, the officer would have started
at step 2 and progressed to step 5. It states that the officer

would have received a 41.9% compounded increase over the term of

 

he contract when taking both the annual increases and step
movement on the salary guide. Kapoor testified that the
correction officer’s pay has outpaced the C-CPI-U and the CPI-w
since 2008. (E-2)

I note that these comparisons between correction
officer’s salary increases and each measure of CPI are based
upon increases allegedly granted by virtue of the last

interest arbitration award, which ended in 2010. No data was

 

provided as to the cost-of-living since January 1, 2011.
However, it is generally well known that the cost-of-living

as calculated by the CPI-U Index (all urban areas, not

seasonally adjusted) increased over the past twelve-month

 

period at an average annual rate at approximately 1.5%, as
reported by the Bureau of Labor Statistics.

61

The most recent salary increase analysis® for interest
arbitration on PERC’s website shows that the average increase

for awards from January 1, 2011 through December 31, 2011 was

 

2,058, while voluntary settlements for the same time period
averaged 1.87%. For 2012, awards averaged 1.86% while
settlements averaged 1.77%. For the period January 1, 2013
through August 20, 2013, awards averaged 1.66% while
settlements averaged 2.01%. Awards included various guide
adjustments, increases to top step only; limitations on
retroactivity; freezing of guide movement, and adding of steps
to a guide, It must be noted however, that most awards issued
in 2012 and 2013 were subject to the 2.0% interest arbitration
cap.
Private Sector Wage Survey

The New Jersey Department of Labor Wage Reports, issued
in September 2012 and August 23, 2013°, shows that the average
annual wages in the New Jersey private sector increased by
2.1% between 2011 and 2012 while the local governmental
sector increased during the same period by 1.4%. The same
report broken down by county shows a private sector wage
decrease in Warren County of -,9% between 2010 and 2011. The

same reports show that the annual wages in the State’s

62

private sector increase again increased between 2011-2012 by
2.1%, with the local government sector increasing by 1.5%.

I give almost no weight to the component of
comparability with the private sector other than to observe
the private sector wage increases as noted above, that New
Jersey's unemployment rate is about 7.4%, and the economic
recovery for everyone is slow to take root. On the one
hand, public sector law enforcement officers are not
subject to the same concerns as private sector workers or
even public sector civilians, in that layoffs are
infrequent and furloughs are non-existent. However, there
is no particular occupation, public or private, that is an
equitable comparison to correction officers. The
correction officers are unique in a variety of ways,
including the potential to be called upon to uphold the law
at any time, on and off duty; the obligation to carry a
weapon even off duty; the stress and dangers of the job,
the tightly regulated recruitment and training process;
and the lack of portability of public sector law
enforcement officer skills beyond a certain age and beyond
@ geographic region. Moreover, they are frequently
required to work evenings, nights and holidays. Unlike the
private sector, they do not compete in a global economy,

which tends to depress wages.

ANALYSIS OF SALARY ISSUES

Proposed Longevity Roll-In

The FOP proposes to eliminate longevity as a separate
benefit and to roll-in longevity into base pay effective with
the date of this award. Longevity pay is given to unit
employees near the end of the year annually. Correction
officers have already been paid their longevity benefit for 2011
and 2012, but have not yet been paid for 2013. The existing
longevity benefit provides officers with $400 after five years
of service and then $1,000 after ten years of service. The
County has not consented to this proposal. Instead, the County
officers to increase the longevity benefit by 2% annually for
the life of the contract.

I am not inclined to award the FOP’s proposal to eliminate
longevity and add $1,400 to top pay. While the FOP is correct
that, initially, the County would save money by implementing
this proposal, the long term costs do not justify awarding the
proposal. There are 32 correction officers at or above the five
year benchmark in 2013 which are each receiving the $400
longevity payment. There are 13 employees at or above the ten
year benchmark in 2013 which are due to receive the $1,000
longevity payment. In current dollars, the County is projected

to spend $27,200 for 2013 longe:

    

y payments (J-3). Awarding
64

the FOP’s proposal would mean that the 18 employees at top pay
in 2013 would each have $1,400 added to their base pay
immediately for a cost of $25,200 in 2013. Thus, the County
would save $2,000 by implementing this proposal in 2013.
However, the long term effect of adding $1,400 to base pay would
be that it would increase the base upon which overtime
calculations are derived. It would also increase holiday pay
and the payment of unused sick leave upon retirement (E-4,
Article 11) which is based upon daily rates of pay. In
addition, it would increase pension contributions for both the
County and for the correction officer.

From the correction officer’s point of view, the proposal
would effectively eliminate the $400 longevity payment currently
being enjoyed by 32 unit employees who have more than five
years, but less than ten years, of service with the County. If
the FOP’s proposal were awarded, these employees would have to
wait until they hit the top step of pay (at ten years) before
they realize any benefit of rolling-in the longevity to base
pay. The loss of $400 annually (between the employee’s fifth
year and his tenth year) totals $2,500 loss over a five-year
period, which would take another five years’ additional service
to recoup. Accordingly, I find that the long-term cost of this
proposal outweighs the benefit to the FOP members and is not in

the public interest. The proposal is not awarded.
65

The County proposes a 2% increase to longevity pay in each
year of the new contract. The FOP has not consented to this
proposal but offers no rationale in its brief explaining its

objections. Accordingly, I award the longevity increases as

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

follows:
‘New Longevity Amounts

Salary Increases

The County argues that this award is subject to the 2.08
cap on interest arbitration awards as mandated by Chapter 105
P.L. 2010. The 2008-2010 contract provides at Article 26,
“Duration” that, “The terms and provisions of this agreement
shall be in full force and effect commencing January 1, 2008 and
ending December 31, 2010”. Contracts with an expiration date of
December 31, 2010 have already been held by the Public
Employment Relations Commission to be exempted from the 2.0%
arbitration cap. See, Burlington County Prosecutor, P.E.R.C.
No. 2012-61, 39 NJPER 20 (44 2012), affirmed in relevant part,
N.J. App. Div., 40 NJPER 41 (2012), Pet for Cert. pending. This
matter does not dictate a different result. The 2.08
arbitration cap does not apply to the contract being awarded

herein,
66

With regard to the parties’ offers, I find that the
County’s offer of 0% for the life of the contract is not
justified by the facts of this case. I also find that the
Union’s proposal of 9.0% (before compounding), is equally
unrealistic.

First, employees moving through steps of the salary guide
have already received step advances in each year of the proposed
contract. Neither party is proposing that these increment
payments be rescinded; instead both parties propose that
employees not yet at top pay receive no across-the-board raises
for the life of the contract. The Employer's cost of providing
these increments was $206,883 in 2011, $265,397 in 2012, and
$251,839 in 2013, I agree with the parties that those
correction officers not yet at top step of the salary guide by
2013, are not entitled to any additional pay increases for the
life of the contract.

Article 7, Section 2 of the 2008-2010 contract specifically
provides:

(Als a condition to and in consideration for the

agreement for step movement, the FOP and the County

shall stipulate to the step movement in the year 2011

and in any subsequent year thereafter in accordance

with the provisions of N.J.S.A. 34:13A-16 (g) (4), in

any subsequent mediation or interest arbitration

proceeding.

It is further agreed that the cost of such step

movement must be considered by any such mediator or
interest arbitrator as part of the overall
67

compensation of these employees pursuant to N.J.S.A.
34:13A-16 (g) (3) and must be given due weight by the
interest arbitrator as part of the financial impact on
the governing unit, its residents and taxpayers in
2011 and in any subsequent year thereafter in
accordance with N.J.S.A. 34:13A-16 (g) (6).

 

 

I have carefully considered the cost of increment payments
already made for the life of this contract and its financial

impact on the County, Had the parties not voluntarily agreed to

 

a freeze of salary increases for these employees still moving
through the step guide, I would have so awarded it in any event.
I consider this a necessary measure to control salary costs,
notwithstanding the fact that employees in other Warren County
law enforcement groups, notably Prosecutor’s detectives and
Sheriff's officers, receive both salary increases and step
increments in recent contracts.

The County has now settled contracts through at least 2012
with nine of its bargaining units. Raises for employees covered
by these contracts ranged from 1% to 3% in each year of the most
recent contract. Here, the County’s offer of a wage freeze for

officers at top step of the salary guide would leave this group

 

as the only group in County employment to receive no pay
increase in a three-year period. As noted previously, a
comparison to other law enforcement groups in the same

jurisdiction, is not only dictated by the statutory criteria but

has previously been held by the Public Employment Relations
68

Commission to be an important factor in assessing salary rates
for the group under consideration.

On the other hand, the FOP’s demand for 3.0% across-the-
board increases annually significantly exceeds pay increases
awarded to County employees in every other bargaining unit and
has not been justified.

A comparison of the salaries of Warren County’s correction
officers to the pay rates of other law enforcement groups in the
County shows that historically correction officers have been
slightly ahead or slightly behind sheriff's officers - - a
group I consider to be close cousins to correction officers.
Both groups work under the jurisdiction of the County's
sheriff's department. Both groups handle the same population of
felons, albeit at different stages of processing through the

investigatory and judicial phase and later the custodial phase.

 

ties, similar

 

Both groups have similar duties and responsibil
hazards and risks of the job, and similar law enforcement powers
to act on and off-duty.

In 2008, sheriff's officers earned top pay of $62,738 while
correction officers received a top pay of $61,161. By 2010,
correction officers were $2,500 ahead of sheriff's officers pay
in that sheriff’s officers earned $66,559 while correction
officers earned $68,836. This is in part attributable to

2009

 

corrections officers having a received a 6.0% increase i
69

and again in 2010, while sheriff's officers received a 3.0%
increase during the same period. In 2013, sheriff's officers’
salary at top pay is now $71,377, assuming that the County
approved the recent memorandum of understanding for a 2011-2014
contract with that bargaining unit. Here, I intend to award a
2.08 increase annually to top pay correction officers for the
life of the contract. This will put correction officers and
sheriff's officers more in line with each other in terms of pay
comparability.

I note that the settlement in correction superiors provided
for a 2,0% across-the-board increase in 2011, another 2.0%
increase in 2012, and another 2.0% increase in 2013. By 2013,
correction superiors’ pay exceeded the pay rates for sheriff's
superiors by only a few hundred dollars. While sheriff’s
officers might be considered close cousins to correction
officers, correction superiors are the most closely related
group in that they hold the positions next in line in a
correction officer’s career path. Therefore, I give significant
weight to the internal patterns of settlement for these two
groups. Here, my award of 2.0% annually for top pay correction
officers parallels the increases negotiated with the correction
superiors.

As previously discussed above, an analysis of the external

pay rates of correction officers in comparable jurisdictions,
70

would include the New Jersey counties surrounding Warren County
and, to a lesser extent, the Pennsylvania counties of
Northampton and Monroe. An analysis of the three contiguous New
Jersey counties (Sussex, Morris and Hunterdon) reveals an
average top pay of $77,089; while the two contiguous
Pennsylvania counties has an average of $46,549. I give greater
weight to the pay rates in the New Jersey counties as the
Pennsylvania counties had a significantly lower cost-of-living
and 80% of Warren County’s employees do not live in
Pennsylvania. Warren County’s correction officers have a
current pay of $68,836, which is more than $8,000 under the
average of New Jersey county correction officers in the relevant
area. It is also about $7,000 below the State-wide average for
all correction officers. Therefore, this across-the-board pay
increase for correction officers at top step needs to be awarded
so that these employees can at least maintain their ranking
without falling further behind average pay.

It is in the public interest that County correction
officers’ pay scales remain competitive with other jurisdictions
to attract and retain quality officers. Otherwise, turnover
rates will increase and public funds will be wasted on
recruitment and training expenditures only to see employees
leave Warren County employ to seek employment in higher paying

jurisdictions. This also supports the criteria of continuity
n

and stability of employment. High turnover rates leave the
correction officer workforce with inexperience staff which in

turn further endangers the safety of correction of.

 

ers.
Accordingly, I find that a 2.0% increase in each year of the
award for officers at top pay is an appropriate raise and is
supported by the evidence. Additionally, it will allow officers
at top pay to keep pace with cost-of living increases during the
contract period.

However, to limit the cost to the County for retroactivity
payments, the 2.0% annual raises will be effective on July 1 of
each year.

I find that the increases being awarded herein are within

the County's ability to pay and will not endanger violation the

 

Employer’s lawful authority, including the appropriations and
levy caps. First, the money the County expended to pay
correction officers’ increments, as well as longevity payments
for 2011 and 2012, has already been appropriated and expended.
It does not need to appropriate additional funds to cover these
costs.

Second, in the 2013 budget the County has $362,376 reserves
in its salary account for the County jail. ‘The County’s own
witness testified that this reserve amount is not likely to be

expended for current expenses in 2013 and is potentially

available for raises. While it appears that the County woul,

 
2

 

e to hold down costs increases for this bargaining unit to
partially offset declining revenues associated with the Warren
Haven Nursing Home, I note that no other County bargaining unit
(including AFSCME, which represents Warren Haven employees) made
such a sacrifice. It would be unfair to the 18 employees at top
step to now ask these employees to accept a three-year wage
freeze because the County has a large deficit associated with
Warren Haven.

Third, the total cost of correction officers’ salaries
including longevity and uniform allowance, pursuant to J-3,
actually decreased by $91,920 from 2012 into 2013. Accordingly,
I find that there will be no financial impact on the taxpayers
of Warren County by virtue of this award. Further, this award
will have no impact on the County's cap limits.

ry Guide Revisions

The FOP proposes to decrease the starting salary for new
correction officers hired after the date of this award from the
current rate of $41,080 to $38,000. It also proposes to add an
additional step between existing steps 8 and 9 on the salary

guide. The existing salary guide is as follows:
23

 

Step

The County has not consented to either FOP proposals concerning
salary guide provisions but its brief provides no argument as to
why these proposals should not be awarded. I intend to award
both proposals.

With regard to the new recruitment rate, the proposed rate
of $38,000 is $3,080 below what the County is currently paying
new recruits. I am confident this lower recruitment rate will
not deter qualified applicants from applying with corrections
positions with Warren County especially given the current
economic conditions and New Jersey's unemployment rate of 7.4%.
Recruits only remain at step one on the salary guide until
graduation from the academy or completion of their first year of
employment, whichever comes first. It is always in the public
interest to obtain quality public services at the least possible
cost provided it does not impact on unit stability and

continuity. I find that this new recruit rate will have no
4

impact on unit stability and continuity and at the same time
will save the County money. I award this proposal.

The FOP also proposed to add a new step between step 8 and
step 9 of the salary guide effective with the date of the award.
As shown below, after the 2.0% annual increases are applied to

the top step, the increment amount between the step 8 and step 9

   

is $14,748. This “bubble” is too large an increment value to be
paid an employee all at one time and therefore needs to be cut

half. Therefore, I award the creation of a new step 9 half

 

way between old step 8 and step 9. The step formerly called

step 9 will become step 10. The resulting salary guide is as

 

 

follows:
2010 T/AfA4 | 7/1/12 | 7/1/13 | 9/23/13

To be clear, all current employees at or below step 8 will

progress normally through the salary guide when increments are
75

paid. Employees currently at step @ will move to the new step 9
when increments are paid. Employees currently at step 9 on the
old salary guide will not be reduced in salary but will be paid
at the new step 10 on the salary guide. No current employee
will be reduced in salary as the result of implementation of
this guide.

Adoption of the salary guide above is in the public
interest as it will reduce the price of increments going forward
at the top step. It is my belief that adoption of this new
salary guide will not negatively impact upon unit continuity or
stability or employee morale.

Future Increments

The County proposes to eliminate the step guide going
forward into future contract years. The FOP vigorously opposes
this position. The FOP argues that the County has provided no
evidence why the continued provision of step movement within
the salary guide would be detrimental to either the County or
to the public.

The FOP emphasizes that the County has continued step
movement for both the Prosecutor’s detectives as well as the
sheriff’s officers. To treat the correction officers
differently would be manifestly unfair.

The FOP cites testimony of both President Lovenberg

and Vice-President Bowlby that eliminating the step guide
76

would be very detrimental to morale and would destroy the
salary system which has been maintained over the past
decade. They have testified that officers view the step
system as integral to their salary system. Further,
according to Lovenberg and Bowlby, it would be very difficult
to recruit and maintain competent officers if they are not
able to advance on the guide. Both Lovenberg and Bowlby
testified that, in the past, without step movement the
turnover was significant. The FOP cites the 2003 award of
Arbitrator Glasson in which Glasson found that automatic
step movement on the guide was then an absolutely necessary
component to solve the County’s severe turnover problem,
which was causing a wasteful expenditure of recruiting and
training costs as new hires would go through the academy
and then leave for other jurisdictions where salary
adjustment is possible. The FOP argues that, without the
continuation of step movement, all of the problems
outlined by Arbitrator Glasson would return.

Further, the FOP maintains that the costs of increments
are funds already expended by the County since officers have
moved through the guide for all three years.

I am disinclined to eliminate the step guide from the

contract as the County proposes. In 2003, Arbitrator Glasson
7

awarded automatic movement on the step guide and reduced the

steps from 13 to 9 steps. He reasoned:

The parties agree that the single most important
issue in this matter is the high turnover rate of
correction officers and the need to improve the
Salary structure for correction officers. This issue
is paramount to the interest and welfare of the
public. Recruitment and retention of correction
officers is a serious problem in Warren County as
evident by the large number of correction officers on
Step 1 through 4 on the 2002 salary guide. The 2002
data shows 50 correction officers on various steps of
the salary guide. 35 of the officers are on the
first four steps of the 12~step salary guide. The
salaries of these 35 officers range from 26,288 to
$30,232. There are only five officers on the top
three steps. There is clearly a high incidence of
turnover.

This turnover creates a continuous need to train newly
hired officers. Training of Correction Officers is
justifiably an expensive proposition. Tt is
exceedingly expensive when you have a high turnover
rate. High turnover produces a continuing spiral of
recruitment and training resulting in a significant
number of inexperienced Correction Officers. The
parties agree that in the best interest of the County
and the FOP (and certainly the interest and welfare
of the public) to reverse the high turnover rate and
stabilize the work force, This is important in all
work environments but it is particularly important in
a correctional facility given the inherited dangers of
the job and the need to maintain the highest levels of
safety and supervision, Highly trained and
experienced correction officers are essential to
maintaining high standards of safety and supervision.
The FOP and the County recognize the need to reverse
the high turnover rate and provide a better salary
structure with the career path to maximum. It is
also the norm for Correction Officers employed by
the State of New Jersey and nearly all municipal police
departments in the State.
78

The same rationale applies today. Outright elimination of
the step guide would mean that employees, especially those in
the lower steps, would remain frozen in place on the guide
without any possibility of upward mobility to higher pay and
would result in these employees inevitably moving on to other
employers where such upward mobility is offered. This in turn
would cost the County in wasted training dollars. It would also
demoralize employees and cause high turnover, which in turn
would result in a less experienced workforce to staff the County
Jail. None of these outcomes could be considered to further the
public interest.

While I will not dismantle the employees’ current step
guide, I intend to freeze employees on their current step going
forward into the next contract unless certain circumstances
dictate otherwise as discussed below. At the expiration of this
contract, this bargaining unit will be subject to the 2.0% cap
on arbitration awards pursuant to Chapter 105, P.L. 2010. Under
the provisions of this statute, an interest arbitrator is
limited to awarding a maximum of 2.0% increases in base salary

which is inclusive of base pay, increments, and longevit

 

 

increases. In January, 2014, approximately 46 employees would
be eligible to receive step increases. Step increases have in
recent years cost the County more than $250,000 per year for

this unit. It is therefore very likely that the increment load
79

will far exceed the available cap should the parties require
interest arbitration to settle the contract. The outcome in
these circumstances is often to forego or delay increments or,
where increments have been paid, to freeze the salary guide in
place for at least part of the contract period. In short,
payment of increments in January might well mean that there is
no money left available under the 2.0% cap for any increases for
unit employees beyond increments. Alternatively, officers might
be required to repay increment amounts that have already been
paid out. Therefore, I award the following contract language:

an interest arbitration salary cap is still in
effect as of January 1, 2014, Officers who are not at
top step in 2013 will not move to the next step in the
guide in 2014 until the parties finalize a successor
agreement though negotiations or through interest
arbitration. Those officers will then move, if
applicable, pursuant to the terms of the successor
agreement. If the 2014 step movement cost does not
exceed any interest on salary cap in effect

sf Janu L, 2014, upon mutual agreement by the
parties, those officers in the guide shall receive

is step increment in 2014 prior to resolving the
successor agreement.

 

 

    

      

I note that this same language is also contained in the recent
memorandum of agreement between the County and the PBA for the
sheriff's officers unit. Awarding this language is in the
interests of the public, in the interest of the County and in
the interest of the correction officer bargaining unit as a

whole in that it will broaden the possibilities for bargaining a
80

successor agreement without the handicap of increment costs
already incurred.
Cost of the Award

The cost of the awarded salary increases for 2011 is $5,508
(8 officers x $1,377 increase /2 = $5,508). The cost of the

awarded salary increases for 2012 is $14,634 (13 officers x

$1,404 increase /2 = $9,126; plus carryover costs from 2011

increase of $5,508 = $14,634). For 2013, the cost of the
awarded salary increases is $22,014 (18 officers x $1,432

increase /2 = $12,888; plus the carryover costs from 2012

 

reases of $9,126 = 22,014).

The cost of longevity increases as provided in this award
is $2,719 in 2011; $476 in 2012; and $4,355 in 2013.'° The costs
to increases in the uniform and maintenance allowance are $1,200
for 2011; $1,260 for 2012; and $1,260 for 2013 (based upon 60

employees).

NON-SALARY ISSUES:

Emergency Closures

The Employer proposes to add the following new provision to

the contract under Article 8, Overtime:

 

 

Longevity costs shown above factor in changes in the workforce whi
resulted in fewer employees being longevity eligible

   
81

Section 4:
A Storm Day or Emergency requiring the closure of
County offices shall mean only an official declaration
of same made by the Board of Chosen Freeholders or the
County Administrator and shall not include those
declared by the State of New Jersey or those
promulgated by the Warren County Department of Public
Safety, Office of Emergency Management. For purposes
of this Agreement, a Storm Day or Emergency declared
by the Board of Chosen Freeholders or County
Administrator shall be memorialized by memorandum to
be filed with and retained by the Finance Department,
Payroll and shall include starting and ending dates
and times of the closure of County offices.

  

 

Non-Essential Employees

Should an employee report for work and subsequently
the Employer decide to officially close the Employer's
offices for any reason, such employees that report to
work shall be credited for the day’s work. Should the
Employer for any reason officially close the
Employer's offices before the start of the workday,
all employees scheduled to work that day will be
credited with a day’s work.

 

Essential Employees
Essential employees shall be paid double time for each

hour worked by them during a Storm Day or Emergency
when officially declared by the Board of Chosen
Freeholders or County Administrator. The double time
shall be earned for all hours worked during the entire
period of an officially declared storm or emergency.

In the event an essential employee cannot report for
work because of storm conditions or emergency
conditions, the time lost from work will be charged
against accumulated vacation or personal leave time.
In the event that no such leave time is available, the
time lost from work will be charged as time off
without pay. If an essential employee is unable to
report to work, the employee must report this absence
no less than one and one-half (1 4) hours before the
starting time of their shift or the start of their
normal workday.

Determination as to which employees are essential and
which are non-essential may vary given the
82

circumstances of such event leading to the issuance of
an official declaration of a storm day or emergency.
Department/division heads are given authority to
determine classification of essential and non-
essential employees. At minimum, essential employees
shall always include those necessary to maintain
statutory or code-related mandated minimum staffing
levels at Warren County’s 24-hour institutions/
operations.

Non-Essential and Essential Employees with Previously

Approved Leave of Absence:

During any officially declared storm day or emergency,
employees absent from work for a previously approved
leave of absence, paid or unpaid, shall remain in such
status. These may include vacation leave, personal
leave, sick leave, workers’ compensation leave,
FMLA/FLA leave, disciplinary leave. In the event that
an essential employee with a previously approved leave
of absence is available to report for work, is called
out by their Department/Division head and does report
for work, such employee shall be paid as described in
this Agreement and the previously approved leave time
shall be credited to the employee's leave time
balances.

 

The existing contract provides for:

Section 4

Employees shall be paid double time for each hour worked by
them during a storm or other emergency when the storm day
or emergency is officially declared by the Employer and
nonessential employees are officially excused from work or
from reporting to work, The double time shall only be
earned during the period when nonessential employees are
excused from work or from reporting to work due to the
storm or emergency condition. This Section only applies to
countywide circumstances. The word “officially" as used in
this paragraph shall mean only an official declaration by
either the County Administrator or the Board of Chosen
Freeholders.

The Employer seeks the new language on a prospective

basis from date of award, It argues that the purpose of the
83

language is to bring clarity to its storm/emergency policy
after the “trials and tribulations” experienced when the
cunty closed its offices to all but non-essential personnel

after Hurric

 

ane Sandy. It notes that the language in the
expired contract is now the subject of a separate grievance
arbitration scheduled in December, 2013. The County also
notes that the newly proposed language has already been
adopted by other bargaining units and is an improvement over

existing language in the FOP Lodge 171 contract.

 

FOP maintains that this County proposal has not been
supported by evidence in the record which would justify it,
and therefore, it should be rejected.

T have compared the existing contract language to the
proposal to discern what the impact might be on correction
officers specifically. First, under both the old and the new
language, the decision to declare an emergency/storm day rests
with the employer - - either the Board of Freeholders or the
County Administrator, not any outside entity, such as the
State. Second, both the old and the new language provide that
correction officers working on the emergency/snow day are
entitled to double-time day. The new language would require
the employer to set a start time and stop time to the

“emergency”, thus making it clear what hours exactly are
double-time eligible -- as opposed to simply a “storm day”,
which allows for far more ambiguity. Fourth, the prior policy
did not distinguish between essential personnel and non-
essential personnel - - the new policy does. The new policy
permits the employer to designate employees into either the
essential or non-essential category. Given the nature of
correction officers’ work, I assume that most correction

sitions would be deemed essential, but this may not

 

be true of all unit positions. The record is silent on this;
however, IT note that the MoA with the sheriff’s officers
designated all unit personnel as “essential.”

The new language adds that employees who cannot report
for work will be charged with vacation or personal leave.
While this was not included in the prior language, I have to
assume that anytime an employee cannot come to work results in
the employee being charged leave time. While the new language
appears not to permit an employee from charging sick time on
an emergency day, that is a fair result, as sick leave is
meant to cover an employee's illness.

I also note that most of the County’s employee units have
signed on to the same snow/emergency policy, including
APSCME’s County-wide civilian unit, and the Sheriff's

officers. Thus, awarding this snow/emergency day policy will
85

provide consistency among County employees and clarity to the
contract lancuage, which in turn will reduce disputes over

amb. interest. The

 

Snow/Emergency Day proposal is awarded.
comp Time
Article 10, Section 3, concerns the scheduling of
employee compensatory time off. This section currently
provides,

With regard to the scheduling of compensatory days
off, the first through the seventh such days off in
any calendar year shall be scheduled by the employee
by requesting same at least 14 calendar days in
advance, which request shall be granted by the
employer provided that the requested day off may be
granted without interference with the proper conduct
of the government function involved.

The Employer seeks to amend this language to provide:

With regard to the scheduling of compensatory days
off, the first through the seventh such days off in
any calendar year shall be requested by the employee
and the compensatory day shall occur before September
15. Any days not selected to occur before September
is*" may be scheduled by the administration. This
request may be granted by the Sheriff provided that
the requested day off may be scheduled without
interference with the proper conduct of the government
function involved...

 

 

 

 

 

 

The FOP argues that the County has provided no evidence
why a change in this contract article should occur and
therefore, it should be denied. There has been no evidence
that the contract clause has created a problem and there has

been no evidence how this would be beneficial either to the
86

employees or the public.

It appears that the Employer seeks to have employees
schedule seven of their comp days to be taken before September
15, and if not taken by that date, the administration may
designate the officer’s comp time days. It appears that the
Employer is seeking to have employees use up their comp days
before the end of a given calendar year and not carry them
forward from year to year. However, the County has not
provided any information in record that would reveal what
problem this proposal is designed to correct. Are employees
accumulating significant comp time leave? Are too many
employees putting in for comp days during peak vacation times
around the holidays? Are employees now carrying comp time from
year to year? Without additional information, this proposal
contract revision has not been justified, and I decline to
award it.

Leave Approval

Article 11, Section 9: currently provides,

 

Section $: Leaves Without Pay

The grant or denial of request for leave without pay is
discretionary with the County. The request must be
made in advance and must be recommended by the
employee's department head, with the appointing
authority retaining the ultimate decision-making power.
If the department head is opposed to the request, the
employee shall have the right to file a written
submission with the appointing authority. The
appointing authority shall have the discretion, on
87

his own or at the employee’s request, to schedule a
meeting with the employee and his union
representative, to discuss the request. The decision
of the appointing authority shall be final and non-
reviewable (emphasis added) .

The Employer seeks a change to the second and third
sentences such that the recommendation would come from the
employee’s supervisor rather than the department head. The
provisions otherwise remained unchanged. The FOP has not
consented to this language, but has presented no specific
argument in its brief concerning its opposition

It appears to me that this proposal merely changes the
designated Employer representative responsible for making a
recommendation concerning an employee's request for unpaid
leave. The choice of a designated representative to make such
recommendations should be uniquely up to the Employer in any
event. I see no adverse impact to the correction officer unit
by awarding this minor change, particularly since the language
permits an employee an avenue of appeal in the event that the
supervisor recommends against granting an unpaid leave. This

contract revision is awarded.

Bereavement Leaves
The Employer seeks to rewrite this entire section of

the contract. The existing contract language provides
88

Section 6: Bereavement Leave
The County shall provide bereavement leave with pay not to
exceed three (3) working days in the case of death of an
employee's spouse, children, brothers, sisters, mother,
father, mother-in-law, father-in-law, grandchildren or
grandparents. Additional days may be approved by the Warden
in advance and charged against administrative personal
leave.

  

The County may provide one working day's bereavement leave
with pay in the case of death of a relative of the second
degree; that is, uncle, aunt, niece, nephew, cousin,
sister-in-law or brother-in-law provided the granting of
such leave by the Warden is not grievable under his contract.
As soon as possible, an employee shall notify the Warden of
a death in his family, and of his need for leave.
Notification must be given as in the case of Sick Leave.
Proof of death may be required by the County.

The new contract language, as the Employer proposes,
would increase maximum bereavement leave and rewrite the
clause as follows:

1. The Sheriff shall provide bereavement leave with
pay not to exceed five (5) working days total per
calendar year, A maximum of five (5) bereavement
days may be utilized in case of the death of a first
degree relative as defined below. Any remaining
balance of unused bereavement leave days can be
utilized in the case of the death of a first degree
relative or second degree relative as defined below.
With regard to second degree relatives, employees
shall be limited to one (1) bereavement leave day per
occurrence.

2, First degree relatives shall be defined as
follows: an employee’s spouse, civil union partner,
children, foster children, brothers, sisters, mother,
father, mother-in-law, father-in-law, grandchildren,
grandparents, step-children, step-mother, step-
father, son-in-law, daughter-in-law, grandparents-in-
law. Additional days may be approved by the Sheriff
and charged against other types of leave.
89

3. Second degree relatives shall be defined as
follows: an employee’s uncle, aunt, niece, nephew,
cousin, sister-in-law, or brother-in-law or persons
sharing the same residency, living quarters, or
dwelling provided that proof of cohabitation is
provided.

 

This proposal appears to enhance the bereavement leave
benefit to the employees. However, the FOP has opposed this
proposal. The Employer has not provided me with sufficient

justification in the record for changing the benefit.

 

Accordingly, the proposal cannot be granted.

Retiree’s Health Benefits

The Employer asks to change Article 13, Medical Benefits;
specifically, section C, as follows:

Employees hired after the execution date of this
agreement will not be entitled to lifetime benef
upon retirement from their employment with Warren
County.

 

The FOP vigorously objects to this proposal. It argues
that the County provided no evidence to support this change,

nor acost analysis of the existing benefit or potential

 

savings. It notes that any benefit from this proposal will not
inure to the County until 25 years from now. Further, the FOP,
citing the testimony of its witnesses, contends that eliminating
retiree health benefits would create a major disincentive in

recruiting new correction officers and would encourage

correction officers to leave for other departments that do
90

provide for such retiree health benefits; thus, creating a
turnover problem. Both FOP witnesses testified that a
constant turnover of staff degrades the ability of officers to do
their jobs and degrades their ability to provide services to
Warren County. Therefore, the FOP argues, ending retiree
benefits would have a major negative impact on the continuity
and stability of employment and should be denied

The County has not provided any data about the cost of
retirees’ health benefits. While it almost goes without saying
that health benefits are a significant expense to the County, that
generic assumption is insufficient to justify this proposal
Further, I note that no law enforcement group in the County has

yet accepted this plan, so it certainly cannot be said that a

 

pattern of internal comparability exists.

If I were to award the County’s proposal to eliminate all

 

health benefits for future employees, consequences would
inevitably result. For one, correction officers are now

contractually eligible to re

 

e from PFRS after 25 years of
service to the County, with paid health benefits. Often,
correction officers are eligible to retire in their 50's or even
40's. Employees not having health care through another source
would be discouraged from retiring, and would simply continue to
work to maintain health benefits. Second, I agree with the FOP

that the elimination of retiree health benefits would put the
1

County at a competitive disadvantage in recruiting and retaining
quality correction officers, especially in light of the fact that
most New Jersey law enforcement groups have such a benefit,
including the sheriff's officers of the same Warren County
sheriff's department, ‘The County would again be squandering
training money on recruits only to have them leave for other
departments were the benefit is offered. Therefore, I find that
this proposal is not in the public interest, and does not foster
unit stability and continuity. The County has not justified this
proposal, and it is not awarded herein

Vacancy Postings

The Employer seeks to add a new provision to Article

22, “Miscellaneous Provisions” at Section 5, which would

state,

All vacancies and filling of vacancies shall be
posted by the administration.

 

This section as presently written provides that:

The filling of all vacancies (whether special jobs,
regular shifts, or otherwise), if the qualifications
of applicants are equal, then seniority shall govern.

; The County shall provide seven days’ notice of the
filling of a vacancy by posting a notice of same, but
only in the event the County is aware of the need for
the filling of a vacancy at least seven days in
advance of same.

It appears that the contract as presently written only

requires the employer to provide notice that the vacancy
92

was filled, not to post the vacancy before it is filled.
Therefore, this language appears to clarify and enhance the
notification to employees of a vacancy. The FOP poses no
specific argument in objecting to this proposal.

This proposal will insure that correction officers are
aware of vacancies as they occur and before they are
filled. Therefore, it enhances employee working conditions
and morale, and reduces dissent after vacancies are already

filled. I therefore award this amended language change.
93

AWARD

 

I award the following:
1, Term of Agreement: January 1, 2011 through December 31, 2013.
2. Salary Increases:

a. Increase salaries for officers at the top step of the
salary guide by 2.0% effective July 1, 2011; 2.0% effective July
1, 2012; and 2.0% effective July 1, 2013.

b. Effective September 23, 2013, add a new recruit step of
$38,000, to be known as step 1.

c. Effective September 23, 2013, add a new step 9 of
$65,675. Former step 9 will now be step 10 at $73,049. The

Employees currently at step 8 will move to the new step 9 upon
receipt of their next increment. Employees currently at step 9

will retain the same dollar value as their current step which
94

will now be known as step 10. No employee will be reduced in

pay as a result of implementation of this salary guide.

Longevity: Longevity payments will be increased

retroactively to January 1, 2011 pursuant to the following

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

schedule:
New Longevity Amounts
2011 | 2012 | 2013 |
5 Years' Service 40g | 416 | 424
10 Years' Service 1020 | 1040 | 1061
4. Increments: Modify the contract language concerning

increments as follows:

an interest arbitration salary cap is still in
effect as of January 1, 2014, Officers who are not at
top step in 2013 will not move to the next step in the
guide in 2014 until the parties finalize a successor
agreement though negotiations or through interest
arbitration. Those officers will then move, if
applicable, pursuant to the terms of the successor
agreement. If the 2014 step movement cost does not
exceed any interest arbitration salary cap in effect

1, 2014, upon mutual agreement by the

 

 

 

parties, those officers in the guide shall receive
step increment in 2014 prior to resolving the

successor agreement.

Emergency/Storm Days: Replace the contract language in

Article 8, Section 4, with the following:

Section 4:
A Storm Day or Emergency requiring the closure of
County offices shall mean only an official declaration
of same made by the Board of Chosen Freeholders or the
County Administrator and shall not include those
declared by the State of New Jersey or those
promulgated by the Warren County Department of Public

 
95

Safety, Office of Emergency Management. For purposes
of this Agreement, a Storm Day or Emergency declared
by the Board of Chosen Freeholders or County
Administrator shall be memorialized by memorandum to
be filed with and retained by the Finance Department,
Payroll and shall include starting and ending dates
and times of the closure of County offices.

Non-Essential Employees
Should an employee report for work and subsequently

the Employer decide to officially close the Employer's
offices for any reason, such employees that report to
work shall be credited for the day's work. Should the
Employer for any reason officially close the
Employer's offices before the start of the workday,
all employees scheduled to work that day will be
credited with a day’s work.

Essential Employees:
Essential employees shall be paid double time for each

hour worked by them during a Storm Day or Emergency
when officially declared by the Board of Chosen
Freeholders or County Administrator. The double time
shall be earned for all hours worked during the entire
period of an officially declared storm or emergency.

 

the event an essential employee cannot report for
work because of storm conditions or emergency
conditions, the time lost from work will be charged
against accumulated vacation or personal leave time.
In the event that no such leave time is available, the
time lost from work will be charged as time off
without pay. If an essential employee is unable to
report to work, the employee must report this absence
no less than one and one-half (1 %) hours before the
starting time of their shift or the start of their
normal workday.

Determination as to which employees are essential and
which are non-essential may vary given the
circumstances of such event leading to the issuance of
an official declaration of a storm day or emergency.
Department/division heads are given authority to
determine classification of essential and non-
essential employees. At minimum, essential employees
shail always include those necessary to maintain
statutory or code-related mandated minimum staffing
96

levels at Warren County's 24-hour institutions/
operations.

 

Non-Essential and Essential Employees with Previous]:
Approved Leave of Absence

 

 

During any officially declared storm day or emergency,
employees absent from work for a previously approved
leave of absence, paid or unpaid, shall remain in such
status. These may include vacation leave, personal
leave, sick leave, workers’ compensation leave,
FMLA/FLA leave, disciplinary leave. In the event that
an essential employee with a previously approved leave
of absence is available to report for work, is called
out by their Department/Division head and does report
for work, such employee shall be paid as described in
this Agreement and the previously approved leave time
shall be credited to the employee’s leave time
balances.

 

Leave Approval: Modify Article 11, Section 9 by
replacing the words “department head” with “supervisor” in

the second and third sentences.

 

Vacancy Postings: Add the following new provision to

Article 22, at Section 5:

 

All vacancies and filling of vacancies shall be posted
by the Administration.

 

All proposals previously agreed upon by the parties as
recited above, shall be incorporated into the successor
agreement. All proposals by the County and the FOP not
awarded herein are denied and dismissed. All provisions of

the existing agreements shall be carried forward except

 

for those which have been modified by the terms of this

Award and/or agreed to by the parties as reflected herein.
7

Pursuant to N.J.S.A. 34:13A-16(f£), I certify that I have

 

taken the statutory limitation imposed on the local tax levy
cap into account in making the award. My Award also explains

how the statutory criteria factored into my

 

nal

determination.
