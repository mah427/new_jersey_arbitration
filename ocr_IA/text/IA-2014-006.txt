On November 25, 2013, the Borough filed a Petition to Initiate Compulsory
Interest Arbitration. On December 11, 2013, | was appointed through random
selection from PERC's Special Panel of Interest Arbitrators to serve as interest
arbitrator. The law requires that | issue an Award within 45 days of my

appointment.

On December 11, 2013, | notified the parties that a mediation sessions was
scheduled for December 18, 2013 and an interest arbitration hearing was

scheduled for December 23, 2013.

Final offers and settlement offers were exchanged during the mediation
session of December 18'". The parties requested additional time to consider the
settlement offers and, therefore, the hearing scheduled for December 234 was
postponed to January 6, 2014. In the end, mediation did not produce a

settlement.

The interest arbitration hearing was held at the Borough's temporary
offices located in Brick, New Jersey at which time the parties argued orally,
examined and cross-examined witnesses and submitted documentary evidence
into the record. Testimony was received from Borough Councilman Stanley

Witkowski, Patrolman Jon Meyer, Detective Sergeant Stacy Ferris, and Borough
Consultant Raymond A. Cassetta. The parties provided post-hearing briefs on

January 8, 2014, whereupon the record was declared closed.

BACKGROUND

The Borough is a residential, seaside community located in Ocean
County. It is comprised of approximately 0.643 square miles (0.385 square miles
of land) and a population of 296 residents. Recent statistics indicate that the
Borough had a median household income of $151,667, and a median family

income of $200,833.

PBA Local No. 347 represents the Department's Patrol Officers, Sergeants
and Lieutenants. The Chief is excluded from the bargaining unit. The parties’
prior Agreement was effective from January 1, 2009 through December 31,

2012. Ex. J-1].

The Borough's final salary offer indicates that there were six (6) bargaining
unit members in 2012 - 4 Patrol Officers, 1 Sergeant, and 1 Lieutenant. One of
those officers, Stacy Ferris, was placed on assignment as the Operations Chief of
Emergency Management as the result of the devastation of Hurricane Sandy.
Although Ferris was promoted to Sergeant in 2013, her salary and benefits have
been reimbursed by the federal government going back to October 29, 2012.
Ferris retains a police title and police powers, but she does not serve as a
Borough police officer. Her assignment as the Operations Chief is currently for

an indefinite period of time.
The parties submitted substantial evidence in support of their respective
positions. | thoroughly reviewed that information. Given the strict time
constraints under the statute | have extracted significant portions of the legal
arguments from the parties’ briefs rather than providing a general summary

herein.
The Borough's Position?

The first negotiation meeting between the parties occurred on October
10, 2012. Fifteen months later the parties are still at the bargaining table. Thus
the duration of the salary settlement is inseparable from the salary itself. The PBA
has proposed a two year contract and salary settlement beginning on January
1, 2013, and ending on December 31, 2014. A settlement limited to these dates
would return the parties to the bargaining table immediately after the interest
arbitration award is issued. This creates a very undesirable situation. The parties

need a period of labor peace and harmonious working relations.

During the arbitration hearing neither party disputed the composition and
cost of the bargaining unit. Therefore, the arbitrator is released from the
obligation set forth in Borough of New Milford, 2012-53, 38NJPER340, to define
the bargaining unit and determine the base year salary. The bargaining unit is
composed of Officers Dryburgh, Ferris, Meyer and Shewan plus Sergeant
Saccone and Lieutenant Barcus. The 2012 base year salary cost of this
bargaining unit is set forth in the Borough's submission at Tab 2, Exhibit C, in the
column entitled “2012 Total Base Pay." This bargaining unit conforms to the
Borough's Appendix B Police Manuel, adopted July 20, 1998. Portions of the

Manuel have been submitted as Tab 1, Exhibit A of the Borough's proposal.

? The Borough's position was taken from pages 2-7 of its Brief.

THE MERITS OF THE BOROUGH'S TWO TIER SALARY PROPOSAL

Each of the six bargaining unit member has worked for the four years of
the most recently expired contract plus the one year since the contract's
expiration under the terms and conditions of a seven (7) step salary guide with
step and longevity movement occurring on the officer's anniversary date of
employment. The Borough's position is that the arbitrator should not disrupt this
term and condition of employment for current bargaining unit members. These
bargaining unit members initially accepted employment with the Borough with
the expectation that they would (1) achieve a maximum salary as a patrol
officer on the seventh anniversary of their employment, (2) achieve a four
percent (4%) longevity adjustment on the eighth anniversary of their
employment, and thereafter receive a two percent (2%) or a one percent (1%)
longevity adjustment every three years. The incumbent bargaining unit

members should not be denied this expectation.

Unfortunately, the existing salary structure results in the automatic salary

increases set forth below.

STEP AMOUNT INCREMENT INCREMENT
2012 DOLLARS PERCENT

1 $56,345 oe ---

2 $62,465 $6,120 10.86%

3 $68,584 $6,119 9.80%

4 $74,706 $6,122 8.93%

7
5 $80,541 $5,835 781%

6 $86,947 $6,406 7.95%

7 $93,065 $6,118 7.04%

Dollar and percentage increases of this magnitude are exactly what the
State legislature intended to eliminate when the legislature modified the Public
Employer-Employee Relations Act, N.J.S.A. 34:13A-16, in 2011, to limit the size of

salary settlements.

By awarding a four (4) year salary settlement the arbitrator will honor both
the Borough's commitment to the current bargaining unit members and the

State legislature's intent when the State modified the aforementioned statute.

Strict adherence to the current salary structure, without modification,
results in the four year increases shown in Tab 2, Exhibit C, of the Borough's
submission to the arbitrator. This will result in Officer Shewan, Sgt. Saccone and

Lt. Barcus receiving the following increases.

Shewan $2,616 2.56%
Saccone $1,483 1.31%
Barcus $1,123 0.09%

The arbitrator, within the statutory limitations, could award the full 2% per year
salary increase by awarding each of the three officers listed above an
additional $1,540 or some variation of that amount.

8
By the expiration of a four year agreement all of the incumbents will have
passed through the large step or longevity advancements set forth above and
the Borough will have a sustainable salary structure for these employees. To
issue an award that is anything less than four years forces the parties to deal with
the 4% longevity increment and the 7% to 10% step increments in the collective
bargaining agreement following the agreement being discussed herein. The
Borough requests that the arbitrator end the agony of disparit pay increases in

one four year contract instead of two three year agreements.

This raises the question of a sustainable salary structure for future
employees. The Borough's proposal in Tab 2, Exhibit E, is not ideal but it is
sustainable. An ideal structure would initially have both less steps and smaller
step increases. However, the Borough acknowledges that interest arbitrators in
general have been reluctant to create sustainable salary guides with small

increments.

The Borough's proposal of a $50,000 starting salary exceeds either the
starting salary or the second fier salary in the exhibits submitted by the PBA. In
fact, the Borough's proposed starting salary exceeds the starting salary listed in
alll of the agreements placed before the arbitrator. The Borough is will to offer

this higher starting salary to attract the best candidates and reward them
accordingly. The higher starting salary offsets any perceived lost income

through a lower salary later in an officer's career.

The PBA submitted the collective bargaining agreements from six
comparable municipalities for the arbitrator's consideration. A review of these
agreement reveals the following.

‘Agreements with a second tier

Exhibit 11A © Manasquan $35,000 Effective 10/1/13 to 12/31/16

Exhibit 10 Point Pleasant Beach $45,596 Effective 9/16/11 to 12/31/14

Exhibit 6 Point Pleasant $36,356 Effective 4/1/13

Agreements without a second tier

Exhibit 9 Bay Head no 24 tier$41,000 in 2013 to $43,076 in 2015

Exhibit 8 Seaside Park no 2% tier $40,150 in 2013 and $40,752 in 2015

Exhibit 7 Seaside Heights no 2" tier. Agreement negotiated prior to the

change in the statute. The starting salary is $32,500 in 2013.

In addition, the Ship Bottom interest arbitration award submitted by the

Borough, see Tab 2-2 contains a second tier starting of $36,490.

Four out of the six agreements or awards in evidence that were
negotiated under the revised statute contain a second tier of wages for new

hires. The arbitrator cannot ignore this fact.

The Borough acknowledges that the proposed second tier maximum
salary is below the maximum salary of the other municipalities. However, the

objective is to reduce the cost of the built in increment and thereby create a

10
sustainable salary structure for the future. Time and future negotiations will

adjust the maximum salary.

THE COST OF THE PBA'S SALARY PROPOSAL

The PBA presented a salary proposal as follows.

“1) 2 year contract 2013 / 2014”
“2) 1.5% 07-01-13"

“3) Step increase: 10/1/13 & 7/1/14"

This proposal does not make any reference to when longevity increases occur.
In the absence of any specific statement, and based on prior PBA proposals, the
Borough must assume that longevity increases will continue to occur on the

anniversary date.

Addressing the officers in the order they are listed on the Borough's

exhibits the PBA’s proposal results in the following during 2013.

Dryburgh's step increase from 5 to 6 is delayed from August 1s to October

18. He does benefit from the 1.5% salary guide increase on July 1, 2013.

1
Ferris receives her 4% longevity increase on her anniversary date of April
17, 2013. The 4% is applied to her 2012 base until July 1 when the base
increases by 1.5%. Ferris spends the period from July 1, 2013, to December 31,

2013, on the increased step 7.

Meyer is paid at the 2012 step 7 rate from January 1 to June 30. From July
1 until his anniversary date on December 19 he is paid at the new step 7 rate.

Thereafter Meyer is paid at the new step 7 rate plus 4% longevity.

Shewan, Saccone and Barcus only receive the 1.5% salary adjustment on
July 1. None of these three officers are eligible for a longevity adjustment in

2013.

The salary adjustments described above are shown in Appendix A of this
brief and increase salaries by $22,975 and 3.795%. If the above interpretation of
when longevity increases occur is incorrect and Ferris must wait until October 1st
and Meyer must wait until the following year to receive the longevity increase

the savings is only $1,397 and the percentage of increase drops to 3.564%.

The same analysis for 2014 results in the figures that are included in

Appendix A of this brief with a dollar increase of $24,088 and 3.833%.

12
Even if the end of year salary for the police officers instead of the
statutorily required “aggregate amount expended by the public employer on
base salary items for the members of the affected employee organization in the
twelve months immediately preceding the expiration of the collective
negotiations agreement ....” The PBA's proposal far exceeds the arbitrator's

authority.

CONCLUSION

The Borough requests that the arbitrator review both his own prior analysis
of the 2% hard CAP set forth in N.J.S.A. 34:13A-16.7 and the analysis provided by
interest arbitrator Susan Osborn in Tab 3-2, (pages 37-40) of the Borough's

submission during the hearing.

When this requested review is completed the arbitrator will be fully aware
of the need for a four year collective bargaining agreement covering the
period from January 1, 2012, through December 31, 2015. Further, the arbitrator
must acknowledge the fact that the PBA’s proposal exceeds the limits of his

authority when considering an award.
In the event the arbitrator considers a three year award, the Borough
respectfully requests that the arbitrator fashion an award that does not have

significant carry-over cost to the succeeding agreement.

Since ability to pay is not an issue the Borough requests that the arbitrator

utilize the full 2% that is available each year.

14
The PBA's Position?

The public employer submitted a multipage Proposal providing for
certain adjustments and seeking revisions of the entire compensation plan for all

persons hired after January 1, 2013.

The PBA has maintained throughout the process and its specific position
taken at hearing that significant parts of the Employer's Last Offer Position are
not awardable as a matter of law. Specifically referenced are the significant
compensation modifications for Employees hired after January 1, 2013. It was
stipulated at hearing that there are no new Employees currently on staff who
were hired after January 1, 2013. The Employer's position with respect to new
wage rates, a second and totally disparate wage progression Guide leading to
a different Top Step, different supervisory rates, and the taking of longevity, from
hypothetical Employees to be hired at some point in the future is not awardable.
The Employer represented at hearing freely acknowledged that there were no
persons covered by this Proposal and they did not have any idea as to the
whether or when a future hire might be brought into the Borough's employ who

might then be affected by such position.

* The PBA's position was taken from pages 2-33 of its Brief.

15,
The Employer representative acknowledged on numerous occasions that
virtually every element of its Proposal as to new hires, after January 1, 2013, was
“speculative”. It was acknowledged in questioning by PBA counsel that the
Employer's Position was “speculative” as to who might be impacted. It was
acknowledged as being “speculative” as to when a person might be hired and
whether said hypothetical new person would be able to go through the various
stages of Police Academy completion, certification, completion of probationary
training, etc.. How much money might be spent or saved by virtue of the
Employer's Position as to new hires after January 1, 2013 was at every point
acknowledged to be "speculative". It is this speculative acknowledgement by
the Employer and its position on same that renders any award with respect to

new hires after January 1, 2013 as unawardable.

The Commission has consistently held that an Arbitrator has an obligation
under law to analyze the positions of the parties and calculate the impact of

the various modifications proposed. The Commission has held

Since an arbitrator, under the new law, is required to project
costs for the entirety of the duration of the award, calculation
of purported savings resulting from anticipated retirements,
and for that matter added costs due to replacement by hiring
new staff or promoting existing staff are all too speculative to
be calculated at the time of the award. In the Matter of

Borough of New Milford and PBA Local 83, P.ER.C. No. 2012-53
(Issued April 9, 2012), p. 15.

16
In that case an Interest Arbitrator's Award was vacated for its failure to provide

an appropriate and statutorily mandated cost analysis. The Commission stated:

Further, the arbitrator does not provide a cost analysis of each
year of the award that includes at a minimum step increments
and_ longevity. These calculations are a mandatory
requirement under the new law. We therefore vacate and
remand the award to the arbitrator to provide a new award
that explains which figures were taken into his accounting of
base salary and the costs of each year of the award. In the
Matter of Borough of New Milford and PBA Local 83, ibid., p.
15.

 

In the Borough of Union Beach case (Borough of Union Beach and PBA Local

291, P.ER.C. No. 2014-004, August 8, 2013) a like result occurred with an award
being vacated and remanded to the arbitrator based upon a failure to analyze
the subsections of N.J.S.A. 34:13A-16g. Here, the employer's representative
readily acknowledges that the modifications proposed by the employer cannot
be costed out. Further, in the PERC decision with respect to the Borough of Point
Pleasant case (P.E.R.C. No. 2013-28) the Commission reversed and remanded
the decision of the interest arbitrator because there was no detailed analysis as
to how the items which he awarded would be calculated in any of the four (4)
years which he awarded. The Commission cited New Milford as authority for its
decision. In the Borough of Point Pleasant case there was no costing out of the
changes and modifications of existing contract provisions, primarily with respect
to employees hired after a certain date because such new provisions were

completely speculative inasmuch as the Borough had no_ information

17
whatsoever with respect to the number of officers who might be hired or any
other personnel changes that could occur. The entire presentation was

speculative.

In sum, the elements of the public employer's position set forth in the last
page of Tab 2 of its exhibit (T-1) are not awardable as a matter of law. The
significant modifications therein are nothing more than a speculative
hypothetical overture at dismantling longstanding benefits without any cost
analysis or basis whatsoever. In the Employer's own words frequently expressed

at hearing, the entire set of changes on that page are “speculative”.

INTEREST AND WELFARE OF THE PUBLIC

The sworn personnel of the Mantoloking Police Department are a unique
group of dedicated individuals. They have traditionally and historically provided

@ very high of service to the public and following a cataclysmic event in

destruction created by the storm and the hazards to human safety were all

20

The sworn staff of the Department

The incredible
matters handled in a most professional and efficient manner. The challenges
were of such magnitude that even the New Jersey State Police, as described by
PBA witness Detective Jon Meyer, more than doubled the size of the sworn
Mantoloking Police Department by sending in fifteen (15) State Troopers. The
force thus augmented was able to meet the needs of the public without
exception. Detective Meyer testified as to the nature of police service and the
high level of said service which is provided to all who reside in the municipality or

Pass through the town.

While the Borough may be small in size, the activity levels are significant in
measurable law enforcement matters and said were the subject of both
documentary evidence and testimonial presentation. Exhibit P-5 is a chart
identifying certain measurable areas of law enforcement activities.
Comparisons are made between 2013 and 2012. It should be noted that a
significant part of 2013 was a timeframe in which the Borough was closed. Even
residents were not let back to their homes after the storm in early 2013. Specifics
of the dates and changes were provided through testimony. Notwithstanding
the significant part of 2013 where virtually no residents were permitted, the total
activity levels in 2013 show significant increase. Detective Meyer explained the
unique form of law enforcement, the property crimes that were visited upon the
municipality following the storm and even traffic levels caused by people who

wanted to come down to get a look at the tragedy. Notwithstanding these

21
challenges the work was done by the Department and with great efficiency. At
all times, as described by Detective Meyer, the Police Department staff worked
well together in a cooperative and productive effort to provide the highest level
of services. This group of Officers has truly gone above and beyond what is
normally expected or encountered by law enforcement personnel generally.

This is a special group.

COMPARISON OF WAGES AND TERMS AND CONDITIONS:
QFEMPLOYMENT

Notwithstanding the exceptional level of performance and service
provided to the public by the Mantoloking Police personnel, the Mantoloking
Police Officer is not highly paid among said Officers’ peers. Chart No. 1 below
compares 2012 base pay rates. The rates are for towns' contracts placed into
evidence by the PBA whose relevance was supported by testimony in the
record. The PBA made a specific effort to establish a valid “universe of
comparison” for a valid assessment. The 2012 base rate was used as it is the last

known base rate for Employees in the bargaining unit at issue in this case.

Comparison of Mantoloking to| ($5,348)
Average (5.75%)

 

 

 

 

Clearly identified on Chart No. 1 is the significant lagging below average of the
Mantoloking Top Step Non-Supervisory Pay Rates. The Mantoloking Police
Officer is over Five Thousand Three Hundred Dollars (2 $5,300.00) less
compensated than said Officers' peers. It would take an increase of 5.75% on
the 2012 base rate alone just to catch average. While Chart No. 1 above only
focuses on base rate, it may be noted that numerous other benefits in other
towns are far superior to those available to the Mantoloking Police Officer. For

example, in the only town with a lower base pay rate than is found in

23
Mantoloking on Chart No. 1, Bay Head, there is a far superior longevity program.
In Bay Head longevity starts at year one. In other words, it is virtually impossible
to earn the pay rate set forth on the Salary Guide as all Officers in Bay Head
receive longevity starting at year one of their career. The guide for longevity
maxes out at twelve percent (12%) of base salary whereas the longevity guide
in Mantoloking maxes at ten percent (10%). The key point of course is that the
first longevity benefit available in Mantoloking is at eight (8) years of service
whereas two percent (2%) of annual base is available at one (1) year of service
in Bay Head followed by four percent (4%) at six (6) years and so on. (See Bay
Head Contract, P-9, Article 7, p. 10). Bay Head provides more compensation for

its Officers in the first eight (8) years of said Officer's career.

A key consideration is that the numbers reflected in Chart No. 1 supra. are
not static numbers. The other Departments are reaching resolution for contract
years following 2012, the term at issue here, with regularity and apparent
commonality of the types of settlements experienced. Chart No. 2 on the
following page references and compares base pay rate increases among the

municipalities set forth in PBA exhibits introduced at hearing.

Again, one finds that the average increase, chiefly by voluntary settlements,
achieved among these Officers’ peers in other municipalities exceed the PBA
Position in this case. It is almost a situation of arbitral recognition that virtually
every Department in steps. Virtually every Department has somebody moving
along the longevity guide. The total value, if one includes both step movement
and longevity movement costs would undoubtedly exceed the base rate
numbers reflected in Chart No. 2 above. In short, the averages exceed the

position set forth by the PBA in this case.

Reading both Chart No. 1 and Chart No. 2 together provides an
unfortunate circumstance for the Mantoloking Police Officer. Not only is the
Mantoloking Police Officer paid less than said Officers’ peers in 2012, it appears

@ certainty that said shortfall will increase in subsequent years represented by

25
this Interest Arbitration proceeding. The averages already established in peer
groups exceed the Last Offer Position of the PBA in this case. The across-the-
board increases will eventually increase by 1.5% in each year of the Salary
Guide for Mantoloking Police Officers under the PBA Proposal. Clearly those
1.5% increases in 2013 and 2014 are significantly less to the already established
averages. An award of the PBA Position in this case will virtually guarantee not
only a maintenance of a significantly below average position but in fact will

exacerbate relative standing and position.

At hearing the public employer introduced data on the Consumer Price
Index. The Consumer Price Index as presented is essentially a private sector
presentation for all Employees, only a small percentage of who are employed in
the public sector. The PBA submits that the best comparisons are those made

with the other law enforcement agencies placed in evidence.

Due to the unique statutory obligation and treatment of Police Officers
under New Jersey Law, any comparison of said law as it applies to private sector
employees as compared to Police Officers must result in a strong justification for
significantly higher compensation to be paid to Police Officers. In a decision,
well known Interest Arbitrator Carl Kurtzman considered this subject of private

sector comparisons and wrote as follows:

26
As other arbitrators have noted, it is difficult to compare
the working conditions of public sector police officers
with the working conditions of private sector employees
performing the same or similar services because of the
lack of specific private sector occupational categories
with whom a meaningful comparison may be made.
The standards for recruiting public sector police officers,
the requisite physical qualifications for public sector
police and their training and the unique responsibilities
which require public sector police to be available and
competent to protect the public in different emergent
circumstances sets public sector police officers apart
from private sector employees doing somewhat similar
work. Accordingly, this Comparison merits minimal
weight. (Borough of River Edge and PBA Local 201,
PERC IA-97-20, pg. 30)

   

 

The PBA respectfully asserts that private sector comparisons should not be
considered controlling in this case. In the first instance, there is no comparable
private sector job compared to that of a police officer. A Police Officer has
obligations both on and off duty. This is most unusual in the private sector. A
Police Officer must be prepared to act and, under law, may be armed at all
times while anywhere in the State of New Jersey. Certainly this is not seen in the
private sector. The Police Officer operates under a statutorily created public
franchise of law enforcement with on and off duty law enforcement hours.
Once again such public franchise and unique provision of statutory authority is
not found in the private sector. There is no portability of Pension in the law
enforcement community after age thirty-five (35). Police Officers may not take
their skills and market them in other states as one may market one's own

personal skills in the private sector. A machinist or an engineer may travel

27
anywhere in the county to relocate and market their skills. This is not possible for
a Police Officer. The certification is valid locally only. The nature of Police work
is inherently one of hazard and risk. This is not frequently seen in the private

sector,

The following represents certain statutory and other precedential laws
controlling the relationship of Police Officers to their employers. Specifically

distinguished is the private sector employee from said employee's employer.

1. The Federal Fair Labor Standards Act, 29 U.S.C.A. §201, ef seq.
applies different standards to private sector employees and
police officers. Whereas private sector employees have the
protection of the 40 hour work week and the 7 day work
cycle, police officers are treated to much less protection.
Police officers have only relatively recently been covered by
the Act by virtue of the 7k amendment.

2: The New Jersey State Wage & Hour Law, N.J.S.A. 34:11-56a, et
seq. does not apply to the employment relationship between
a police officer and the officer's Public Employer. Private
sector employees are covered under New Jersey Wage and
Hour Laws. Such protections as are therein available are not

available to the police, Pemy v. Borough of Swedesboro, 214
N.J. Super. 488 (1986).

3. The very creation of a police department and its regulation is
controlled by specific statutory provisions allowing for a strict
chain of command and control. Included are statutory
provisions for rules and regulations, specifying of powers and
duties, specifics for assignments of subordinate personnel,
and delegation of authority. N.J.S.A. 40A:14-118. There is no
such statute covering private employment in New Jersey.

28
N.J.S.A, 40A:14-122 provides for specific qualifications which
are statutorily mandated for police officer employment. Such
Tequirements as US Citizenship, physical health, moral
character, a record free of conviction, and numerous other
requirements are set forth therein. No such requirement exists
by statute for private employment in this state.

If an employee in a police department is absent from duty
without just cause or leave of absence for a continuous
period of five days said person, by statute, may be deemed
to cease fo be a member of such police department or
force, N.J.S.A. 40A:14-122, No such provision exists as to
private employment.

Statutorily controlled promotional examinations exist for
certain classes of police officers in New Jersey under fitle 11
and other specific statutory provisions exist under 40A:14-
122.2. There are no such private sector limitations on
promotion.

A police officer in New Jersey must be resident of the State of
New Jersey, N.J.5.A. 40A:14-122.8. No such restriction exists for
private sector employees.

 

Hiring criteria and order of preference is set by statute 40A:14-
123.1a. No such provision exists for private employees in New
Jersey.

There are age minimums and age maximums for initial hire as
a police officer in New Jersey. No such maximum age
Frequirements exist for private employment in this state. Even if
an employee in a police department who has left service
seeks to be rehired there are statutory restrictions on such
rehire with respect to age, 40A:14-127.1. No such provision
exists for private employees in this state.

As a condition for employment in a police department in the
State of New Jersey there must be acceptance into the
applicable Police Retirement System, N.J.S.A. 40A:14-127.3.
No such requirement exists in private sector. The actual
statutorily created minimum salary for policemen in New
Jersey is set at below minimum wage N.J.S.A. 40A:14-131.
Private employees are protected under the Fair Labor
Standards Act. Days of employment and days off, with

 

 

29
Perhaps

or not.

particular reference to emergency requirements are unique
to police work. A police officer's work shall not exceed 6
days in any one week, “except in cases of emergency”.
NJS.A. 40A:14-133. The Fair Labor Standards Act gives
superior protection to private sector employees.

N.J.S.A. 40A:14-134 permits extra duty work to be paid not in
excess of time and one-half. This prohibits the higher
pyramided wage rates which may be negotiated in private
sector. There is no such prohibition in the law applying to
private sector employees.

The maximum age of employment of a police officer is 65
years. No such 65 year maximum applies to private sector
employees.

Police Officer pensions are not covered by the federal ERISA
Pension Protection Act. Private sector employees’ pensions
are covered under ERISA.

Police officers are subject to unique statutorily created
hearing procedures and complaint procedures regarding
departmental charges. Appeals are only available fo the
court after exhaustion of these unique internal proceedings,
NJ.S.A. 40A4:14-147 to 40A:14-151. No such restrictions to due
process protections for private employees exist. Private
employees, through collective bargaining agreements, may
also negotiate and enforce broad disciplinary review
procedures. The scope is much different with police
personnel.

the greatest differentiation between Police Officers and private
employees generally is the obligation to act as a law enforcement officer at all
times of the day, without regard to whether one is on duty status within the state
Police Officers are statutorily conferred with specific authority and
“..have full power of arrest for any crime committed in said Officer's presence

and committed anywhere within the territorial limits of the State of New Jersey."

30
N.J.S.A. 40A:14-152.1. A Police Officer is specially exempted from the fire arms
law of the State of New Jersey and may carry a weapon off duty. Such carrying
of deadly force and around the clock obligation at all times within the State is

not found in the private sector.

Police Officers are trained in the basic Police Academy and regularly
retrain in such specialties as fire arms qualifications. This basic and follow up
training schedule is a matter of New Jersey Statutory law and is controlled by the
Police Training Commission, a New Jersey Statutorily created agency. Such
initial and follow up training is not generally found in the private sector. Failure
to maintain certain required training can lead to a loss of Police Officer

certification and the Police Officer's job. This is rarely found in the private sector.

Mobility of private sector employees is certainly a factor in the setting of
wages and terms and conditions generally for private sector employees. Where
@ company may move from one state to another, there is more of a global
competition to be considered. The New Jersey private sector employee must
consider the possibility that his industrial Employer might move that plant to a
state or even another country. This creates a depressing factor on wages. This is
not possible in the public sector. The Employees must work locally and must be
available to respond promptly to local emergencies. The residency restriction

has been above mentioned. In a private sector labor market one might

341
compare the price of production of an item in New Jersey with the price of

production of that item in other states, even in Mexico.

Local comparisons are more relevant with Police wages. These types of
issues were considered in the recent decision issued by the well known Arbitrator

William Weinberg in the Village of Ridgewood case.

Second of the comparison factors is comparable
private employment. This is troublesome when applied
fo police. The police function is almost entirely
allocated to the public sector whether to the
municipality, county, state or to the national armed
forces. Some private sector entities may have guards,
but they rarely construct a police function. There is a
vast difference between guards, private or public, and
police. This difference is apparent in standards for
recruiting, physical qualifications, training, and in their
responsibilities. The difficulties in attempting to
construct direct comparisons with the private sector
may be seen in the testimony of the Employer's expert
witness who used job evaluation techniques to identify
engineers and computer programmers as occupations
most closely resembling the police. They may be close
in some general characteristics and in "Hay Associates
points", but in broad daylight they do seem quite
different to most observers.

The weight given to the standard of comparable
private employment is slight, primarily because of the
lack of specific and obvious occupational categories
that would enable comparison to be made without
forcing the data.

Third, the greatest weight is allocated to the
comparison of the employees in this dispute with other
employees performing the same or similar services and
with other employees generally in public employment
in the same or similar comparable jurisdictions (Section

32
support by such comparisons.

little or no mobility.

g. 2(a) of the mandatory standards.) This is one of the
more important factors to be considered. Wage
determination does not take place without a major
consideration of comparison. In fact, rational setting of
wages cannot take place without comparison with like
entitles. Therefore, very great weight must be
allocated to this factor. For purposes of clarity, the
comparison subsection g,(2), (a) of the statute may be
divided into (1) comparison within the same jurisdiction,
the direct Employer, in this case the Village, and (2)
comparison with comparable jurisdictions, primarily
other municipalities with a major emphasis on other
police departments.

Police are a local labor market occupation. Engineers
may be recruited nationally; secretaries, in contrast, are
generally recruited within a convenient commute. The
nearby market looms large in police comparisons. The
farther from the locality, the weaker the validity of the
comparison. Police comparisons are strongest when in
the local area, such as contiguous towns, a county, an
obvious geographic area such as the shore or a
metropolitan area. Except for border areas, specific
comparisons are non-existent between _ states.
(Ridgewood Arbitration Award, Docket No.: 1A-94-141,
pages 29 - 31)

For the reasons noted above it is respectfully argued that any time there is
@ comparison made between a Police Officer and a private employee

generally, Police Officer's position must gain weight and be given greater

narrowly structured statutorily created environment in a paramilitary setting with

unparalleled in employment generally. The Police Officer carries deadly force

and is licensed to use said force within a great discretionary area. A Police

Officer is charged with access to the most personal and private information of
individuals and citizens generally. His highly specialized and highly trained
environment puts great stress and demand on the individual. Private
employment generally is an overly generalized category that includes virtually
every type of employment. To be sure in such a wide array of titles as the nearly
infinite number covered in the general category of “private employment” there
are highly specialized and unique situations. The majority, however, must by
definition be more generalized and less demanding. Specialized skills and
standards are not generally as high as in police work. A Police Officer is a
career committed twenty-five (25) year statutorily oriented specialist who is
given by law the highest authority and most important public franchise. The
Police Officer should be considered on a higher wage plane than private

employment generally.

‘STIPULATIONS OF THE PARTIES

At hearing the public employer stipulated that the “ability to pay” issue
was not challenged and it was in fact stipulated. The Employer has stipulated
that it has the ability to pay the amounts at issue in this proceeding. The only
other issues were procedural in nature and not relevant to the ultimate

resolution of this dispute.

34
LAWFUL AUTHORITY PLOYER

A review of criteria g5, under the Act consistent with the testimony and
evidence introduced in this case provides absolutely no prohibition to an award
of the Last Offer Position presented by the PBA. In the first instance, and most
importantly, the public employer stipulated that it had the full “ability to pay” of
the positions in this proceeding. That stipulation being entered into the record
would obviate any detailed analysis of the financial evidence which was also

placed in the record.

Notwithstanding the Employer's stipulation of ability to pay the PBA will
address criteria g5 and offer comments on the “Levy CAP” and “Appropriation
CAP". With respect to the “Levy CAP" is was acknowledged by Employer
witness on cross-examination that the Levy CAP in itself only applied to thirty-
nine percent (39%) of the revenue received by the Borough. The 2013 Budget
(P-2) at sheet 3, line 4 identified Total General Revenues received by the
municipality at Five Million Six Hundred Seventy-One Thousand Three Hundred
Four Dollars ($5,671,304.00). Line 6 of the same page identifies the amount to be
raised by taxes for support of the Municipal Budget as Two Million Two Hundred
Fifty-Nine Thousand Six Hundred Seventy-Eight Dollars ($2,259,678.00). Thus the
amount fo be raised by taxes is only thirty-nine percent (39%) of the revenue.

The balance of the revenue comes from uncapped sources. In the same

35
Budget document at sheet 3B(1) on the right hand side of the page is the full
computation of the property tax levy CAP. The calculations show that the Levy
CAP presented absolutely no prohibition to funding in this Budget. In fact the
amount utilized in the adoption of the Budget was Eight Hundred Fifty-Six
Thousand Three Hundred Sixty-Nine Dollars ($856,369.00) below the Levy CAP
limitation. Clearly, the Levy CAP did not negatively impact the budget
preparation. This amount, Eight Hundred Fifty-Six Thousand Three Hundred Sixty-
Nine Dollars ($856,369.00) does not simply go away at the end of the budget
year. Rather this amount of money goes forward into future years as part of
“CAP Banking". On the lower right hand comer of the page the statement is
identifying the CAP Bank available as Eight Hundred Fifty-Six Thousand Three
Hundred Sixty-Nine Dollars ($856,369.00). In the next year's budget this is the
amount that will be added to the CAP formula at the commencement of
calculations, Finally, with respect to CAP Banking the history of the last two (2)
years CAP Banking is identified. From the 2011 Budget there was Fifty-Two
Thousand Three Hundred Seventy-Nine Dollars ($52,379.00) in CAP Bank going
forward. In the 2012 Budget there was One Hundred Four Thousand Five
Hundred Ninety Dollars ($104,590.00) banked for forward utilization. In the 2013
Budget, as noted above, there was over Eight Hundred Fifty Thousand Dollars
($850,000.00) banked for future use. The trend is clear. There is no Levy CAP

problem in this town. On the same page to the right there is also a calculation

36
of the Appropriation CAP which also did not prohibit the adoption of a budget

for 2013.

The municipality in this case is not a poor town. This is an enclave of multi-
milion dollar homes, largely second homes to persons living elsewhere. The
ratable base in the most recent document certifying same (Annual Financial
Statement, P-4 in evidence) shows a net valuation taxable of just over $1.6 Billion
Dollars ($1,600,000,000.00). That $1.6 Billion Dollar ($1,600,000,000.00) ratable
base is essentially all made up of five hundred twenty-one (521) homes. Were
there any doubt that most of these homes are multi-million dollar secondary
residences, one need only to consider the testimony of the Employer witness
who acknowledged that only forty (40) homes presently have garbage picked
up. On cross-examination it was acknowledged by the same witness that of the
five hundred twenty-one (521) homes there are only two (2) school students and
they are sent to another town for education. One would be hard pressed to
make a case for any sort of pressure on taxpayers in this circumstance. Further,
the Employer witness acknowledged that the current cash collection rate of
taxes (97.26%) was very high and well above the State average (See Exhibit P-4,
Sheet 22, Line 13). High tax collection rates, extremely high ratable base all are
elements that would indicate a wealthy municipality far removed from any

taxpayer pressure.

37
The Employer essentially based its entire case on the so-called “Two
Percent Hard CAP" stating that since the Arbitrator could not award more than
two percent (2%) the PBA's case was in excess of that amount and the
Employer's case was more awardable. The PBA takes issue with this position and
in fact finds fault with the calculations of the Employer which were presented at

hearing in book form.

The PBA bargaining unit is made up of six (6) persons, one (1) Lieutenant,
one (1) Sergeant, and four (4) Police Officers per the stipulation and proofs
introduced by both parties at hearing. The PBA will identify each member of the
bargaining unit and the asserted cost of the contract maintenance (J-1) as in

some cases incorrectly calculated by the Employer.

Lieutenant Barcus is a Police Officer in the rank of Lieutenant and has
served the Department since his hire on January 1, 1995. As a Lieutenant of
Police there is a singular pay rate and due to his years of service he has reached
Top Step Longevity. The cost of contract maintenance does not therefore alter
with respect to said member's compensation from 2012 to 2014. As calculated
on Employer Exhibit C, the cost of Lieutenant Barcus both in 2012 and 2013,
absent adjustment is One Hundred Twenty-One Thousand Two Hundred Eighty-

Eight Dollars ($121,288.00).

38
Sergeant Saccone was hired by the Department June 1, 1996. The
Sergeant's pay rate is fixed and not subject to any step change. The longevity
rate together with base rate was calculated by the Employer to be One
Hundred Thirteen Thousand Three Hundred Fifty-Three Dollars ($113,353.00). This
amount should have been applicable fo both 2012 and 2013 as there was no
change from 2012 to 2013 and both longevity columns show an eight percent
(8%) longevity rate on Employer Exhibit C. The proper number therefore should
be One Hundred Thirteen Thousand Three Hundred Fifty-Three Dollars
($113,353.00). There is no increase in cost of contract maintenance for Sergeant
Saccone from 2012 to 2013. Likewise in 2014 there is no increase in longevity nor

provision for increase step value at the Sergeant's rank.

Next in seniority is Police Officer Shewan who was hired February 1, 2002.
The Employer Exhibit C incorrectly lists his hire date as November 1, 2002. This is
important because for eleven (11) months of 2012 Officer Shewan was at the six
percent (6%) rate of pay, not two (2) months of 2012. The Employer calculated
2013 number is accurate at One Hundred Three Thousand Nine Hundred

Seventy-Six Dollars ($103,976.00).

Next in seniority is Officer Ferris who was hired April 1, 2006. Officer Ferris
commenced Top Step Pay upon completion of six (4) years and going into the

seventh (7')) year which took place April 1, 2012. The change from 2012 to 2013,

39
referencing contract maintenance cost, is only the change in the longevity
value attributable to member Ferris. Four percent (4%) longevity to an Officer at
top pay rate is four percent (4%), or in dollars, Three Thousand Seven Hundred
Twenty-Two Dollars ($3,722.00). Since that amount was only paid for three-
quarters of the year, the amount attributable in contract maintenance is an
increase of Two Thousand Seven Hundred Ninety-One Dollars ($2,791.00) to
Ferris. Thus the cost of maintenance of contract rights for Officer Ferris in 2014
should only increase by said amount for a total of Ninety-five Thousand Eight
Hundred Fifty-Six Dollars ($95,856.00). The Employer's calculations for Ferris
overstate contract maintenance cost by Two Thousand Three Hundred Seventy-

Three Dollars ($2,373.00) for 2013.

Police Officer Meyer was hired December 18, 2006. Officer Meyer
completed his sixth (6) year and began his seventh (7!) year as of the
beginning of 2013. The cost of the step which was effective as of the end of
December 2012, beginning of 2013, is Six Thousand One Hundred Eighteen
Dollars ($6,118.00) (Step 6 to Step 7 pay rate) which when added to the amount
actually paid to Officer Meyer (See Employer Exhibit C) in 2012 of Ninety-One
Thousand Six Hundred Forty-Two Dollars ($91,642.00) gives a total of Ninety-Seven
Thousand Seven Hundred Sixty Dollars ($97,760.00) in 2013. Incorrectly stated on
Exhibit C of the Employer's presentation is the fact that Officer Meyer received

four percent (4%) longevity in 2013. This Police Officer had not completed seven

40
(7) years of service and be eligible in the eighth (8'") year for a longevity benefit
until the very end of the year which would be payable in 2014 not 2013. The
Employer's calculation therefore overstates compensation to Officer Meyer

attributable to contract maintenance in 2013.

Police Officer Dryburgh was hired August 1, 2008. The only change in
compensation is the calculated 2013 step increase for a total of Eighty-Seven

Thousand Seven Hundred Twenty Dollars ($87,720.00).

The above calculations when totaled showed that the Employer has
significantly overstated the 2013 contract costs in its calculations. In addition to
the inaccuracies and understatements with respect to 2012, the 2013 costs are
totaled on Chart No. 3 below.

CHART NO. 3
CONTRACT MAINTENANCE COSTS FOR 2013

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

lieutenant Barcus $121,288
Sergeant Saccone $113,353

Police Officer Shewan $103,976

Police Officer Dryburgh $87,720

Total Contract Maintenance Cost in 2013 $619,923

 

 

41

 
The key consideration in this calculation is the fact that Officer Ferris should not
be included in the calculation. Officer Ferris is not a paid member of the
Department. While the Officer is a sworn member, one hundred percent (100%)
of Ferris’ compensation and benefits are paid through a FEMA reimbursement to
the Borough. Details were supplied at the hearing in detail explaining how the
reimbursement works, that it is for an indefinite period of time, and that all costs,
without exception, are paid by outside source money. As a result the
compensation of Officer Ferris should be removed from the Employer cost
column in 2013. This would result in a reduction in the calculation set forth at the
bottom of Chart No. 3 by Ninety-Five Thousand Eight Hundred Fifty-Six Dollars
($95,856.00). The actual cost of payment of Police Officers in 2013 is Five
Hundred Twenty-Four Thousand Sixty-Seven Dollars ($524,067.00). Thus in 2013
the cost of policing in Mantoloking, with respect to taxpayer obligation, actually
dropped significantly. It cost significantly less to patrol the Borough in 2013, with
all step and longevity adjustments included, than it did in 2012. Even if one uses
the above referenced incorrect calculation for the Employer in its own exhibit
[Exhibit C) of the total cost of Six Hundred Five Thousand Four Hundred Sixty-
Seven Dollars ($605,467.00) and compares it to the true cost of actual taxpayer
dollars in 2013 of Five Hundred Twenty-Four Thousand Sixty-Seven Dollars
($524,067.00) the result is a reduction in cost of Eighty-One Thousand Four

Hundred Dollats ($81,400.00).

42
In a true base cost of Five Hundred Twenty-Four Thousand Sixty-Seven
Dollars ($524,067.00) the PBA has proposed a wage increase on the Guide of
1.5% across-the-board effective July 1 of 2013. This amount, 1.5% of the total
cost, is Seven Thousand Eight Hundred Sixty-One Dollars ($7,861.00). Since that
Cost is only implemented at mid-year the true net cost in 2013 is Three Thousand
Nine Hundred Thirty Dollars ($3,930.00). For the second year the base of Five
Hundred Twenty-Four Thousand Sixty-Seven Dollars ($524,067.00) was increased
effective in the first year to Five Hundred Thirly-One Thousand Nine Hundred
Twenty-Eight Dollars ($531,928.00). The additional 1.5% on that sum is Seven
Thousand Nine Hundred Seventy-Eight Dollars ($7,978.00), again effective mid-
year 2014. The net increase attributable in 2014 is Three Thousand Nine Hundred
Eighty-Nine Dollars ($3,989.00). The only other cost impact is the change in step
as indicated in earlier calculations. The total impact of the wage increase on
an across-the-board basis is Seven Thousand Nine Hundred Nineteen Dollars
($7,919.00) which one may add the additional cost of a step, Six Thousand One
Hundred Eleven Dollars ($6,111.00) for a total cost over two (2) years of Fourteen
Thousand Thirty Dollars ($14,030.00). This is under the two percent (2%) allocated
using the Hard CAP. One may note that at hearing the Employer
acknowledged that there could be a two percent (2%) increase in each of two
(2) years. The cost of two percent (2%) increase in each of two (2) years is a net
implementation cost of six percent (6%). The first two percent (2%) is paid twice

and the second two percent (2%) is paid once. The six percent (6%), so

43
calculated in net cost of implementation, even if it was just a two percent (2%)
increase each year, is Thirty-One Thousand Four Hundred Forty-Four Dollars

($31,444.00). Clearly the position of the PBA is well inside of the CAP number.

Ferris has been in this reimbursed position for 2013 and will be in said
Position for an indefinite period likely for several years into the future. The PBA's
Package should not be charged for a non-cost item to the Borough of
Mantoloking. Whatever occurs to Ferris in the future will be paid one hundred
percent (100%) by the federal agency. It is incorrect to include said Officer in
these calculations. The FEMA regulations covering emergency work were
introduced into evidence at hearing (P-17). Regulation 95.25.7 “Labor Cost -
Emergency Work" provides at page 3 provisions for contract employees regular
and overtime costs. The PBA will not interpret these regulations as they appear
clear and applicable in this case. It is the position of the PBA that a proper
calculation of Employer cost in 2013 and beyond should not include any cost for
base compensation or benefits attributable to Officer Ferris. In fact, said Officer
has not performed police service during this period and is acting wholly
administratively dealing with various Federal and State agencies as described in

her testimony,
IMPACT ON THE TAXPAYERS AND RESIDENTS

The impact Police costs as covered by this Interest Arbitration proceeding
are nominal with respect to impact on the local taxpayer. The total Tax Levy is
set forth at the bottom of the Annual Financial Statement (P-4), and should be
shown to be Eight Million Nine Hundred One Thousand One Hundred Twenty-
Nine Dollars ($8,901,129.00). The cost of these bargaining unit services, as
caried into 2013 under the contract represents 6.6% of this total Tax Levy.
Therefore on a hypothetical tax rate of Fifteen Thousand Dollars ($15,000.00) per
year the portion attributable to bargaining unit compensation costs is Nine
Hundred Ninety Dollars [$990.00]. That would represent Eighty-Two Dollars and
Fifty Cents ($82.50) a month with a one percent (1%) cost of Eighty-Two Cents
($0.82) per month on a house with a Fifteen Thousand Dollar ($15,000.00) tax
rate. Each percentage point of increase is another 82.5¢ per month. These are
de minimis figures. Even if one were in a house paying Thirty Thousand Dollars
($30,000.00) a year in taxes the impact of a point is still only One Dollar and Sixty-
Five Cents ($1.65) on a Thirty Thousand Dollar ($30,000.00) tax bill on a multi-

million dollar summer home.

Not only did the Employer not assert any form of tax burden for residential

taxpayer problem, it actually acknowledged the circumstances by stipulating

the “ability to pay” was not an issue in this case.

45
Even the several points raised by Employer witnesses regarding
replacement cost for certain public properties damaged in the storm, all of
these assertions were met and explained by FEMA assigned witness Ferris who
described the reimbursement proceeding, pending applications, and available

applications to be filed. The net impact is very smalll, if any.

In this case the public employer has sought to basically revise the entire

legally prohibited from being awarded and statutorily violative under the Act,
there is no even asserted savings. The Employer just wants a new class of
Officers paid at a different schedule over many more years reaching top pays
for supervisors less than Patrolmen make today. Not only is this unawardable
legally, it is illogical and cannot work to the benefit of the citizens and taxpayers
in this municipality. Having two (2) classes of Officers defined by substantially
different levels of compensation cannot be said to create unity in this most

critical area of public endeavor, public safety. In the future a public employer,

46
as was explained and detailed at hearing, would have the opportunity to
promote a supervisor from the second level or second tier of Employees hired
after January of 2013 instead of an existing Employee and in that process save
Twenty-Nine Thousand Dollars ($29,000.00) per year in the transaction. Current
Employees would be essentially ineligible for promotion because they would be
competing with a much lesser cost Employee. A Lieutenant in the future would
make less than a Step Four Officer today. In short, the Employer's Proposal, in

addition to all else, is a career killer for all people on staff.

The Employer in its presentation at hearing acknowledged repeatedly
and itself used the word repeatedly,”speculative". So characterized, in the

Employer's own words, its own Proposal is unawardable.

One should not overlook the fact that the provisions of the Agreement are
the end result of years of collective bargaining and bilateral Agreements. Each
element of the contract has attached to it a quid pro quo. Now, it appears that
the Employer wants the other end of those bargains previously made and paid

for by the bargaining unit.

In conclusion one must only refer to the Arbitrator's most comprehensive
and well-reasoned statement in the Award regarding the Employer's attempts

to cut in many areas without justification.

47
It must also be noted, particularly in considering the
array of cuts in economic benefits the Township
proposes, that the salary and benefits earned by these
police officers is a result of years of collective
negotiations. It is generally an axiom of negotiations,
especially in the last few years where concessions are
being proposed, that you give something up in
exchange for something else. Here, the employer asks
for an array of give-backs on benefits, but at the same
time, proposes to give virtually nothing in increases. |
intend to take a more balanced approach in this
award. (Township of Byram and PBA Local 138 (Byram
Township Unit), PERC Docket No. 1A-2013-012 (2013)
Award, p.42).

The cost of the PBA Position for 2013 is one-half (14) of the 1.5% across-the-board

wage increase and a like amount for the second year.

Each are mid-year

increases and the total cost of the PBA Position is less than an average of two

percent (2%) over the two (2) years proposed.

48
!'am required to make a reasonable determination of the issues, giving
due weight to the statutory criteria set forth in NuJS.A. 34:13A-16(g). The

statutory criteria are as follows:

1. The interests and welfare of the public. Among the items
the arbitrator or panel of arbitrators shall assess when
considering this factor are the limitations imposed upon
the employer by P.L. 1976, c. 68 (C. 40A:4-45.1 et seq,).

2. Comparison of the wages, salaries, hours, and conditions
of employment of the employees involved in the
arbitration proceedings with the wages, hours, and
conditions of employment of other employees performing
the same or similar services and with other employees
generally:

 

a. In private employment in general; provided,
however, each party shall have the right to
submit additional evidence for the arbitrator's
consideration.

b. In public employment in general; provided,
however, each party shall have the right to
submit additional evidence for the arbitrator's
consideration.

¢. In public employment in the same or similar
comparable jurisdictions, as determined in
accordance with section 5 of P.L. 1995.,c. 425
(C. 34:13A-16.2); provided, however that each
party shall have the right to submit additional
evidence concerning the comparability of
Jurisdictions for the arbitrator's consideration.

3. The overall compensation presently received by the
employees, inclusive of direct wages, salary, vacations,

49
holidays, excused leaves, insurance and_ pensions,
medical and hospitalization benefits, and all other
economic benefits received.

. Stipulations of the parties.

. The lawful authority of the employer. Among the items the
arbitrator or panel of arbitrators shall assess when
considering this factor are the limitations imposed upon
the employer by the P.L. 1976 c. 68 (C.40A:4-45 et seq.)

. The financial impact on the governing unit, its residents,
the limitations imposed upon the local unit’s property tax
levy pursuant to section 10 of P.L. 2007, ¢.62 (C.40A:4-
45.45), and taxpayers. When considering this factor in a
dispute in which the public employer is a county or a
municipality, the arbitrator or panel of arbitrators shall take
into account, to the extent that evidence is introduced,
how the award will affect the municipal or county
purposes element, as the case may be, of the local
property tax; a comparison of the percentage of the
municipal purposes element, or in the case of a county,
the county purposes element, required to fund the
employees’ contract in the preceding local budget year
with that required under the award for the current local
budget year; the impact of the award for each income
sector of the property taxpayers on the local unit; the
impact of the award on the ability of the governing body
to (a) maintain existing local programs and services, (b)
expand existing local programs and services for which
public moneys have been designated by the governing
body in a proposed local budget, or (c) initiate any new
Programs and services for which public moneys have
been designated by the governing body in a proposed
local budget.

. The cost of living.

. The continuity and stability of employment including
seniority rights and such other factors not confined to the
foregoing which are ordinarily or traditionally considered in
the determination of wages, hours and conditions of
employment through collective negotiations and

50
collective bargaining between the parties in the public
service and in private employment.

9. Statutory restrictions imposed on the employer. Among
the items the arbitrator or panel of arbitrators shall assess
when considering this factor are the limitations imposed

upon the employer by section 10 of P.L.2007, c.62
(C.40A:4-45.45).

All of the statutory factors are relevant, but they are not necessarily
entitled to equal weight. The party seeking a change to an existing term or
condition of employment bears the burden of justifying the proposed change. |
considered my decision to award or deny the individual issues in dispute as part

of a total package for the terms of the entire award.

Base Salary & Base Salary Cap Calculation

This Award is subject to the 2% base salary cap ["Hard Cap"] imposed by

P.L. 2010, c. 105. In Borough of New Milford and PBA Local 83, P.E.R.C. No. 2012-

 

53, 38 NJPER 380 ({ 116 2012), PERC cited standards as they relate to interest
arbitration awards having to meet the 2% base salary cap requirements of
NJS.A. 34:13A-16,7:
P.L. 2010, c. 105 amended the interest arbitration law N.J.S.A.
34:13a-16.7 provides:

a. As used in this section:
“Base salary" means the salary provided pursuant to a
salary guide or table and any amount provided

51
pursuant to a salary increment, including any amount
provided for longevity or length of service. It also shall
include any other item agreed to by the parties, or any
other item that was included in the base salary as
understood by the parties in the prior contract. Base
salary shall not include non-salary economic issues,
pension and health and medical insurance costs.

"Non-salary economic issues" means any economic
issue that is not included in the definition of base salary.

b. An arbitrator shall not render any award pursuant to
section 3 of P.L. 1977, c. 85 (C.34:13A-16) which, on an
annual basis, increases base salary items by more than
2.0 percent of the aggregate amount expended by
the public employer on base salary items for the
members of the affected employee organization in the
twelve months immediately preceding the expiration of
the collective negotiation agreement subject to
arbitration; provided, however, the parties may agree,
or the arbitrator may decide, to distribute the
aggregate monetary value of the award over the term
of the collective negotiation agreement in unequal
annual percentages. An award of an arbitrator shall
not include base salary items and non-salary economic
issues which were not included in the prior collective
negotiations agreement.

 

This is the first interest arbitration award that we review under
the new 2% limitation on adjustments to base salary.
Accordingly, we modify our review standard to include that
we must determine whether the arbitrator established that
the award will not increase base salary by more than 2% per
contract year or 6% in the aggregate for a three-year
contract award. In order for us to make that determination,
the arbitrator must state what the total base salary was for
the last year of the expired contract and show the
methodology as to how base salary was calculated. We
understand that the parties may dispute the actual base
salary amount and the arbitrator must make the
determination and explain what was included based on the
evidence submitted by the parties. Next, the arbitrator must
calculate the costs of the award to establish that the award
will not increase the employer's base salary costs in excess of

52
6% in the aggregate. The statutory definition of base salary
includes the costs of the salary increments of unit members as
they move through the steps of the salary guide. Accordingly,
the arbitrator must review the scattergram of the employees’
placement on the guide to determine the incremental costs
in addition to the across-the-board raises awarded. The
arbitrator must then determine the costs of any other
economic benefit to the employees that was included in
base salary, but at a minimum this calculation must include a
determination of the employer's cost of longevity. Once these
calculations are made, the arbitrator must make a final
calculation that the total economic award does not increase
the employer's costs for base salary by more than 2% per
contract year or 6% in the aggregate.

PERC continued its discussion of base salary:

Since an arbitrator, under the new law, is required to project
costs for the entirety of the duration of the award, calculation
of purported savings resulting from anticipated retirements,
and for that matter added costs due to replacement by
hiring new staff or promoting existing staff are all too
speculative to be calculated a the time of the award. The
Commission believes that the better model to achieve
compliance with P.L. 2010 c. 105 is to utilize the scattergram
demonstrating the placement on the guide of all of the
employees in the bargaining unit as of the end of the year
preceding the initiation of the new contract, and to simply
move those employees forward through the newly awarded
salary scales and longevity entitlements. Thus, both
reductions in costs resulting from retirements or otherwise, as
well as any increases in costs stemming from promotions or
additional new hires would not effect the costing out of the
award required by the new amendments to the Interest
Arbitration Reform Act.

We note that the cap on salary awards in the new
legislation does not provide for the PBA to be credited with

53
savings that the Borough receives from retirements or any
other legislation that may reduce the employer's costs.

In the consolidated case of Point Pleasant Borough & PBA Local 158/SOA,

 

PERC Dkt. Nos. 1A-2012-018 & IA-2012-019 (December 2012), the Arbitrator
concluded that he was compelled to apply PERC’s standards to the facts of
that case. | reached the same conclusion in Camden County Sheriff & PBA
Local 277/SOA, PERC Dkt. No. IA-2013-010 (March 2013), Borough of Tenafly &

PBA Local 376, PERC Dkt. No. IA-2013-018 (May 2013), Township of Mahwah &
PBA Local 143, PERC Dkt. No. IA-2013-022 (May 2013), and continue to do so with

respect to this matter.

PERC clarified New Milford in City of Atlantic City & PBA Local 24, PERC

 

Dkt. No. IA-2013-016, P.E.R.C. No. 2013-82:

In New Milford, we acknowledged that parties may not
always agree on base salary information and calculations. In
those circumstances, the arbitrator must make a
determination based on the evidence presented. * * *

 

Thus, we ... direct ... all public employers in interest
arbitration, to provide arbitrators with the required base salary
information and calculation. Such information must include,
at a minimum, in an acceptable and legible format, the
following information:

 

1. A list of all unit members, their base salary step
in the last year of the expired agreement, and
their anniversary date of hire;

54
2. Costs of increments and the specific date on
which they are paid;

3. Costs of any other base salary items
(longevity, educational costs etc.) and the
specific date on which they are paid; and

4, The total cost of all base salary items for the

last year of the expired agreement. {footnote
omitted].

We further clarify that the above information must be
included for officers who retire in the last year of the expired
agreement. For such officers, the information should be
prorated for what was actually paid for the base salary items.
Our guide in New Milford for avoiding speculation for
retirements was applicable to future retirements only.

The Borough indicates that the base salary for 2012 consisted of salary,
longevity and holiday pay. [See Ex. T-2(C)]. The Borough calculated base salary
in 2012 to be $605,467. Based upon the Borough's figure, the annual 2% Hard
Cap under the statute is $12,108. The PBA did not provide an alternative to the
Borough's method of calculation prior to or during the arbitration hearing, but it
disputed the inclusion of Ferris as an active member of the Department for the
duration of the successor agreement. The PBA contends that Ferris’ base salary
must be excluded when determining how the total allowable increases
permitted by statute are allocated to the bargaining unit. My calculations differ
from the Borough's based in large part upon the application of PERC's

standards set forth in New Milford and Atlantic City. | conclude that Ferris’ base

55
salary shall only be considered for the period of time that the Borough paid her
salary without reimbursement from the federal government. To summarize, the
total base salary for 2012 that will be used for the purposes of calculating the
annual Hard Cap is $588,756.87. Based upon my application of PERC's
standards, the base salary as of December 31, 2012 can be increased by an

average annual amount of $11,775.14.

Interests and Welfare of the Public

As | expressed in recent interest arbitration awards, Arbitrators have
recognized that “[t]he interests and welfare of the public [N.J.S.A. NJ.S.A.
34:13A-16g(1)] is paramount because it is a criterion that embraces many of the
other factors and recognizes their relationships.” Township of Mahwah & PBA
Local 143, PERC Dkt. No. |A-2013-022 (May 2013), Borough of Tenafly & PBA Local
376, PERC Dkt. No. IA-2013-018 (May 2013) and Ocean Cty. Sheriff & PBA Local
379A (Superiors), IA-2013-002 (October 2012) citing Washington Tp. & PBA Local

301, 1A-2009-053 (Mastriani 2012); see Borough of Roselle Park & PBA Local

 

27H[SOA), 1A-2012-024, IA-2012-026 (Osborn 2012). Having considered the entire
record, and given the parties’ stipulation, the Borough's ability to pay, the lack
of adverse impact, the interests and welfare of the public, and the Hard Cap

were given greater weight than other factors such as the cost of living and

56
comparability. | now review the interests and welfare criterion through the other

statutory factors addressed below.

Lawful Authority of the Employer/Financial Impact on the Governing Unit, Its
Residents and Taxpayers/Statutory Restrictions Imposed on the Employer

N.JS.A. 34:12A-16g(1), (5), (6) and (9) refer to the lawful authority of the
employer, the financial impact of the award, and the statutory restrictions
imposed on the employer. The Borough does not claim an inability to pay. In
fact, the Borough proposed increases above the amount it calculated to be
allowable under the Hard Cap. The increases | award herein do not exceed the
maximum allowable amount permitted over a period of three (3) years. |
conclude that this Award will not have an adverse impact upon the Borough, its
taxpayers and residents, and it will not prohibit the Borough from meeting its
statutory obligations or cause it to exceed its lawful authority. Further, this Award
serves the interests and welfare of the public through a thorough weighing of

the statutory criteria after due consideration to the Hard Cap.

Comparability

Private Employment

57
Given the unique nature of law enforcement jobs, the comparison to
private employment has not been allotted significant weight in previous interest
arbitration awards. As | concluded in previous Awards, | continue to find no
evidence to support a deviation from giving greater weight to public sector and

internal comparisons.

Public Employment in General/In the Same or Similar Jurisdictions

With respect to public employment, the PBA and the Borough presented
comparisons of this bargaining unit to the law enforcement units in other
jurisdictions in close proximity to the Borough and the New Jersey coastline. The
PBA also included the State Troopers who assisted in the Borough's protection
after Hurricane Sandy. The Borough presented a comparison of police salaries

to those for its non-union employees. [Ex. T-2].

The most recent salary increase analysis for interest arbitration on PERC's
website shows that the average increase for awards was 2.05% from January 1,
2011 through December 31, 2011, 1.86% from January 1, 2012 through
December 31, 2012, and 1.66% from January 1, 2013 through August 20, 2013.
Over the same time periods, reported voluntary settlements averaged 1.87%,
1.77%, and 2.01%. PERC indicates that the average 2012 settlement for the 19

filings that would have been subject to the 2% cap is 1.84%, the average 2012

58
award for 7 filings that were subject to the 2% cap is 1.85%, and the average
2013 award for 7 filings that were subject to the 2% cap is 1.4%. | considered this

information in rendering the final award.

| have reviewed the parties’ comparisons and conclude that this
bargaining unit enjoys a host of competitive economic benefits that fall within
the range of those received in other law enforcement units. These comparisons
were considered but, as stated above, were given less weight than some of the

other statutory factors.

Overall Compensation

The evidence in this matter, as demonstrated by the parties’ exhibits and
the comparisons outlined above, shows that the overall compensation received
by the Borough's officers is fair, reasonable and competitive. | conclude that
the evidence does not establish that the Borough's proposal to implement a
deflated salary structure and to eliminate longevity for new hires would serve the
interests and welfare of the public given that (1) the Borough's ability to pay
officers under the current salary structure is a non-factor in this proceeding, (2)
this Award will not add additional monies to the existing salary guide, and (3) it

has not been demonstrated that the current salary structure is unsustainable.

59
Stipulations of the Parties

The Borough's ability to pay is not a factor in this matter.

The Cost of Living

The most recent statistics from the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics’ website

show the following CPI for All Urban Consumers:

| considered this criterion but give it little weight as it does not have an impact

on the increases awarded herein that will not exceed the Hard Cap over a

period of three (3) years.

60
Continuity and Stability of Employment

This criterion was considered in my review of the evidence. | conclude
that the modifications awarded herein are reasonable under the circumstances
presented and will maintain the continuity and stability of employment. |
conclude that this Award will have less of a negative impact upon the
Department than the Borough's proposal fo eliminate longevity for new hires
and to implement a new salary guide for new hires that not only increases the
number of steps required to reach the top patrol officer step but reduces the
top step by over $13,000, the Sergeant's step by over $14,500, and the

Lieutenant's step by over $16,500.

Having addressed all of the statutory criteria | now turn to the

modifications/proposals that | award.

Award: jodificati Proposals

Term of Agreement

The Borough proposes a term of four (4) years - January 1, 2013 through

December 31, 2016. The Union proposes a term of two (2) years - January 1,

2013 through December 31, 2014. | award a term of three (3) years - January 1,

61
2013 through December 31, 2015 in order to provide labor-management stability
over that period of time. The extension through 2015 is more than one and one-

half years beyond the sunset date for the Hard Cap.

Salary/Salary Guide/Cost Analysis

There were 6 bargaining unit members in 2012 - Lieutenant John Barcus,
Sergeant Eugene Saccone, Patrol Officer William Shewan, Patrol Officer Jon
Meyer, Patrol Officer Stacy Ferris and Patrol Officer Scott Dryburgh. | calculated
the total base salary for 2012 as including salary, longevity and holiday pay to
be $588,756.87. My calculations are based upon the Borough's representations
that all step and longevity movement take place on the anniversary of an
employee's date of full-time hire. The PBA indicated in its post-hearing brief that
Patrol Officer William Shewan's date of hire was February 1, 2002 rather than
November 1, 2002. In its brief the PBA also challenged when Patrol Officer
Meyer will receive his first level longevity. These discrepancies were not raised
by the PBA during the interest arbitration hearing. Under the circumstances, and
given the strict statutory time limitations in this matter, | am inclined to rely upon

the Borough's representations.

62
Article IV of the expired Agreement includes annual base wages for Patrol
Officers, Sergeants and Lieutenants. Set forth below are the annual base wages

for 2012:

YEAR

$56,345
$62,465
$68,584
$74,706
$80,541
$86,947
$93,065
Sergeant $99,579
lieutenant $106,550

NaORwWN—

Article IV also includes a longevity pay schedule and the method of calculating

holiday pay.

The annual Hard Cap is $11,775.14. Applying the Hard Cap to this case,
and having considered all of the statutory criteria, | award the following. The
salary guide as structured in 2012 shall be frozen for the duration of the 2013-
2015 Agreement. Advancement on steps and longevity shall continue in
accordance with Article IV. Given Ferris’ assignment as Operations Chief, there
were only 5 bargaining unit members as of December 31, 2012. Out of the 5,
Patrol Officer Dryburgh is the only officer moving through the salary guide in
2013 and 2014. Dryburgh will reach the top step for Patrol Officer as of August 1,
2014. As to longevity, Meyer receives his first longevity payment effective as of

63
December 19, 2013, Lieutenant Barcus’ longevity increases to 9% effective
January 1, 2014, Shewan’'s longevity increases to 7% effective November 1, 2015,

and Dryburgh receives his first longevity payment effective August 1, 2015.

In accordance with PERC's standards, by utilizing the same complement
of officers employed by the Borough as of December 31, 2012 over a term of
three (3) years, and assuming for the purposes of comparison there are no
resignations, retirements, promotions or additional hires, the increases to base
salary awarded herein increase the total base salary including annual base

wage, longevity, and holiday pay:

Base Salary as of 12/31/12: $509,738.47
2013: $524,567.43 (increase of $14,828.96)
2014: $536,099.03 (increase of $11,531.59)
2015: $542,268.37 (increase of $6,169.34)

All compensation is effective and retroactive to January 1, 2013.

Other Modifications/Proposals not Awarded

As to the remainder of the parties' modifications and proposals |
thoroughly reviewed and considered their respective positions. Having

examined these items in conjunction with the supporting evidentiary submissions
| do not find sufficient justification to award them in whole or in part at this time.

The remaining modifications and proposals are therefore rejected.

CONCLUSION

| conclude that the terms of this Award represent a reasonable
determination of the issues after applying the statutory criteria. | have given
greater weight to the Borough's ability to pay, the lack of adverse impact, the
interests and welfare of the public, and the Hard Cap. | have also considered
all of the other factors and conclude there is nothing in the record that compels

a different result than | have determined in this proceeding.
