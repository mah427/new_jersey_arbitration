This decision arises out of an impasse to be resolved by an interest
arbilration proceeding between the Franklin Lakes PBA Local 150 [the “PBA’ or
“Union’] and the Borough of Franklin Lakes [the ‘Employer’ or “Borough”]. Prior
to this proceeding, the parties conducted mediation sessions with a jointly
selected mediator but were unable to reach an agreement. On July 21, 2015, |
was randomly selected by the New Jersey Public Employment Relations
Commission ["PERC’] to serve as interest arbitrator in accordance with N.J.S.A.

34:13A-16e(1).

The legal requirements for this case are those set forth in NJ.S.A

34:13A-16 through N.J.S.A. 34:134-16.9 as amended on June 24, 2014 by P.L.

 

2014, ¢. 11, These provisions took effect immediately and were retroactive to
April 2, 2014. The existing contract has a termination date of December 31,
2014. Because the petition was filed on June 18, 2015, PERC processed the

interest arbitration petition under the amended statute. N.J.S.A. 34:13A-16b(3)

 

Tequires that the arbitrator hold an initial meeting with the parties for the purpose
of conducting a mediation. That session was held on August 20, 2015. It was
determined that the impasse could not be resolved voluntarily at that time and

the matter then proceeded to formal interest arbitration

Final offers from each party were received on September 4, 2015. A
formal interest arbitration hearing was held on September 11, 2015. An

additional attempt to mediate the impasse prior to the hearing was not
successful. The parties were aware that the flexibility to resolve the impasse
without having to be subject to the statutory salary cap would no longer be
present if the impasse proceeded to an award. At hearing, substantial
documentary evidence was submitted into the record on all aspects of the
statutory criteria, as well as on salary cap calculations. Post-hearing briefs were
due and filed on September 28, 2015. They were transmitted to each party on
that day. On October 14, 2016, the PBA filed a motion to strike certain exhibits
filed by the Borough with its post-hearing brief. On October 15, 2015, the
Borough filed a statement in opposition to the motion.’ Pursuant to P.L, 2014, ¢.
11, the arbitrator has 90 days from appointment, or by October 19, 2015, in

which to render an award.

In accordance with the statute, each party submitted a last and final offer.

These offers are as follows:

BACKGROUND

The municipality of the Borough of Franklin Lakes is located in Bergen
County in an area commonly defined geographically as Northwest Bergen. Other
municipalities considered to be included in northwest Bergen County are
Allendale, Glenlock, HoHoKus, Midland Park, Oakland, Saddle River, Ramsey,
Ridgewood, Waldwick and Wyckoff. The bargaining unit consists of patrol
officers and sergeants. In total there are eighteen (18) employees in the

bargaining unit but there were nineteen (19) as of December 31, 2014

The existing collective negotiations agreement contains complex salary
schedules containing three tiers based upon date of hire. In addition, the “steps”
on the salary schedules in many instances are based upon a grouping of years of
service rather than on an annual basis. | refer to these types of groupings as
bands. Further, the parties, at a prior point of time, eliminated a longevity
Schedule and folded longevity payments into certain steps on the salary
schedule. This has resulted in an elongated salary schedule based upon the
number of years of service. The Agreement also provides that eligibility for
advancement to the next higher patrolman’s grade is based upon their
anniversary date of employment. An exception is for those who attain the rank of
Patrolman Year 18 who receive the appropriate negotiated salary on the first day
of January of each succeeding year. In addition, assignments to the Detective
Bureau/Juvenile Bureau and Traffic Bureau yield an increase of 1.5%. The

respective proposais of the parties reflect that the PBA seeks to maintain the
existing salary schedules while the Borough seeks to amend the step schedule to
add nine (9) steps to members hired between January 1, 1999 and March 27,

2012 and to add 8 steps for members hired on or after March 27, 2012.

The record reflects that the residents of the Borough employs a higher
than normal income. It has over 10,000 residents and its median household
income of $153,681 ranks thirteenth (13°) in New Jersey. The Borough points
out that its budgeting process requires that it adhere to the 2% tax levy cap, as
well as the statutory cap on salary increases that can be awarded in arbitration,
However, it does not assert that it has an inability to pay increases that fall within

the statutory limitations or that adverse financial impact would result from same.

The parties are in substantial dispute over the method upon which salary
increases can be calculated pursuant to the statutory cap on the amount that an
interest arbitrator can award under the amended statute. Their respective
positions on this will be evaluated during the analysis on the salary portion of this
award. In addition, the disputed issues are extensive, including the PBA's
proposal to reduce employee medical contributions, to increase the clothing
allowance and to provide that mandatory training be conducted on an overtime
rate basis. The parties disagree on the term of the Agreement and also the
Borough's proposal to award increases in the number of steps to the existing
salary schedules, to reduce the amount of clothing allowance, to reduce the

annual sick leave allowance, to replace the existing medical insurance plan with
a new plan, to limit retiree medical coverage for new hires until they reach 65
years of age and to require retirees to receive the same level of retiree benefits
as those provided to current employees effective December 31, 2019. Because
of the extremely limited period of time between receipt of post-hearing briefs and
the due date of an award, the issues must be decided without engaging in an
exhaustive summary of the parties’ arguments and evidence. Each issue will be
considered individually, followed by an award setting forth all of the issues

awarded representing changes to the existing collective negotiations agreement

DISCUSSION

The statute requires the arbitrator to make a reasonable determination of
the disputed issues giving due weight to those factors set forth in NJS.A
34:13A-16g(1) through (8) that are relevant to the resolution of the issues. These

factors, commonly called the statutory criteria, are as follows:

(1) The interests and welfare of the public. Among the items the
arbitrator or panel of arbitrators shall assess when
considering this factor are the limitations imposed upon the
employer by (P.L. 1976, c. 68 (C. 40A:4-45.1 et seq}

(2) Comparison of the wages, salaries, hours, and conditions of
employment of the employees involved in the arbitration
proceedings with the wages, hours, and conditions of
employment of other employees performing the same or
similar services and with other employees generally:

(a) In private employment in generat; provided,
however, each party shall have the right to
submit additional evidence for the arbitrator's
consideration.
(5)

6)

{o) In. public employment in general; provided,
however, each party shall have the right to
submit additional evidence for the arbitrator's
consideration.

(c) In public employment in the same or similar
comparable jurisdictions, as determined in
accordance with section 5 of P.L. 1995. c. 425
(C.34:13A-16 2) provided, however, each party
shall have the right to submit additional
evidence conceming the comparability of
jurisdictions for the arbitrator's consideration.

The overall compensation presently received by the
employees, inclusive of direct wages, salary, vacations,
holidays, excused leaves, insurance and pensions, medical
and hespitalization benefits, and all other economic benefits
received

Stipulations of the parties

The lawful authority of the employer. Among the items the
arbitrator or panel of arbitrators shall assess when
considering this factor are the limitations imposed upon the
employer by the P.L. 1976 c. 68 (C.40A;4-45 et seq )

The financial impact on the governing unit, its residents and
taxpayers. When considering this factor in a dispute in
which the public employer is a county or a municipality, the
arbitrator or panel of arbitrators shall take into account to the
extent that evidence is introduced, how the award will affect
the municipal or county purposes element, as the case may
be, of the local property tax; a comparison of the percentage
of the municipal purposes element, or in the case of a
county, the county purposes element, required to fund the
employees’ contract in the preceding local budget year with
that required under the award for the current local budget
year; the impact of the award for each income sector of the
property taxpayers on the local unit; the Impact of the award
on the ability of the governing body to (a) maintain existing
local programs and services, (b) expand existing local
programs and services for which public moneys have been
designated by the governing body in a proposed local
budget, or (c) initiate any new programs and services for
which public moneys have been designated by the
governing body in its proposed local budget.
(7) The cost of living.

(8) The continuity and stability of employment including seniority
rights and such other factors not confined to the foregoing
which are ordinarily or traditionally considered in the
determination of wages, hours and conditions of employment
through collective negotiations and collective bargaining
between the parties in the public service and in private
employment

(9) Statutory restrictions imposed on the employer. Among the

items the arbitrator or panel of arbitrators shall assess when
considering this factor are the limitations imposed upon the
employer by section 10 of P.L. 2007, c. 62 (C.40A:4-45.45).

My review of the criteria must be accomplished based upon the evidence
presented as well as the application of well established standards in collective
negotiations and interest arbitration. The party seeking to modify existing terms
and conditions of employment has a burden to prove that there is basis for its
proposed change. The burden to be met must be at a level beyond a party
seeking additional benefits or concessions to existing terms and conditions of
employment without sufficient evidentiary support. No proposed issue by either
party will be deemed to be presumptively valid in the absence of justification that
is supported by credible evidence. | also observe that a proposal may not be
viewed in isolation to all other proposals. Any decision to award or deny any
individual issue in dispute will include consideration as to the reasonableness of
that individual issue in relation to the terms of the entire award, In other words,
there may be merit to awarding or denying a single issue if it were to stand alone,

but a different conclusion may be reached after assessing its merits within the

context of all of the changes that are included in the overall award.
DURATION

The PBA proposes a three year agreement, effective January 1, 2015
through December 31, 2017. The Borough proposes a five year agreement,
effective January 1, 2015 through December 31, 2019. Almost a full year has
passed since contract expiration. Regardless of the contract duration awarded,
the parties are subject to the statutory salary cap on the amount of salary that
can be awarded. in addition, the record reflects stability in the Borough's
finances and a continuity and stability of employment that serve as a proper

basis for a contract duration of January 1, 2015 through December 31, 2018.

ARTICLE IX - CLOTHING ALLOWANCE

 

Both parties have proposals to change the amount of clothing allowance

currently paid under Article IX(B). The existing benefit provides:

Each Police Officer shall receive an annual clothing allowance.
The amount of clothing allowance is $650.00. Said amount shall be
paid in a lump sum amount on the first day in January, provided
that a newly hired officer shall not be entitled to such allowance
during the same year that he has been provided with an initial issue
of clothing and equipment in accordance with Paragraph A above.

The Borough proposes to reduce the allowance to $150, effective January

1, 2016. It submits:

Officers currently receive a $650 annual clothing allowance plus a
$350 annual uniform maintenance allowance, or a total clothing
allowance benefit of $1,000 per year. Assuming that this decrease
is effective on January 1, 2016, the clothing allowance decrease
will save the Borough $850 per officer times nineteen (19) officers
or $16,150 per year. As a percentage of 2014 total base salaries,
this proposal will reduce the Borough’s costs by 0.87%
(816,160/$1 852,333 x 100) in 2016. The savings will continue in
2017, 2018 and 2019 and beyond.

The PBA proposes to increase the clothing allowance by $250 annually

and urges rejection of the Borough's proposal, It argues:

The PBA proposes an increase to the clothing allowance. The
amount of the clothing allowance has been stagnant over the past
several years. An adjustment for the increase in the cost of living is.
appropriate in this case by way of an increase to the clothing
allowance. The members of the PBA have been subjected to
increased payments over the last five years including healthcare
contributions, increased pension contributions, higher healthcare
costs, among others.

There is a [Borough] proposal to reduce the clothing allowance
from $650 annually to $150 annually. While this will save the
employer a few dollars the impact will be larger on the individual
members. Over a three year contract each employee will lose
$1500. This would negate any increase for the members at top pay
and significantly reduce step increases for the lowest paid
members. The employer cannot provide any basis for such a
drastic reduction. In fact, the employer's own chart shows that the
PBA is gets less than the average of the other towns cited by the
employer. As the PBA proposal requests, the amount for the
clothing allowance should be increased just based upon the
increased cost of living. Cost for purchasing uniforms increases
each year, it does not go down. Taking the huge chunk out of the
clothing allowance that the employer is seeking does nothing more
than further harm the members.

Award

After review of the parties’ proposals, | do not find merit to any alteration of

the status quo. The existing level of clothing allowance is reasonable based
upon alll relevant comparisons and no persuasive justification has been offered
by either party for an increase or decrease in the existing level of benefit

Accordingly, both proposals are denied

GRIEVANCE SETTLEMENT

The parties have a pending unresolved grievance concerning prescription
co-pays for retirees. The Borough proposes that a settlement of the grievance

be awarded. Its proposal is as follows:

The Borough proposes to resolve a grievance arbitration over
prescription co-pays. The grievance arbitration is pending before
Arbitrator Martin Scheinman; the parties have agreed to stay the
grievance arbitration pending the conclusion of this interest
arbitration matter, Like SHBP, the Borough implemented higher
prescription co-pays for ts retirees than its active employees. The
PBA filed a grievance, asserting that the Borough violated the
requirement that it provide “the same level of such benefits
received at the time of retirement” to its retirees. In other words,
the PBA asserted that the retirees should pay the same prescription
co-pays in effect at the time they retired. ‘The Borough proposes to
resolve the grievance by amending coverage for existing retirees
prospectively, effective as of the date of the award, to provide co-
insurance at the same level as provided on the date of retirement.
The Borough, however, declines to provide co-insurance at the
same level as provided on date of retirement for claims based on
coverage prior to the date of the award

The PBA seeks rejection of the Borough's proposal:

The employer has included the settlement of a grievance in its final
proposal that is currently pending grievance arbitration. The parties
had agreed to put off the hearing while they were attempting to
reach a settlement on the contract. However, now that this matter
has proceeded to arbitration, there is no authority for this matter to
be resolved in an interest arbitration award. This is especially so

13
since there is no evidence in the record regarding the underlying
dispute. This proposal should be denied on its face.

Award

| decline to award the Borough's proposal. This matter arose under the
prior labor agreement and is a matter of contract interpretation before an
arbitrator who has been appointed under the parties’ selection procedure. An
imposition of settlement terms would infringe on the PBA’s right to a
determination on the grievance it filed in accordance with the contractual

grievance procedure

ARTICLE X

 

ICK LEAVE

 

Article X sets forth a comprehensive scheme for sick leave. The Borough
proposes to reduce the number of annual sick days from twelve (12) sick days to

ten (10) sick days per year effective January 1, 2016. It asserts:

Currently, all officers receive twelve (12) sick days per year
Employees who do not use all of their accrued sick time are entitled
to one-half a day's pay for each unused sick day per calendar year.
Although the savings cannot be calculated with certainty, the
teduction of sick time from twelve (12) sick days to ten (10) sick
days per year results in a savings to the Borough of about one (1)
day's pay for each officer. In accordance with traditional labor
principals, one day of pay equals about 0.33%. As a result, the
Borough will attribute a 0.33% savings to this proposal in 2016

The PBA submits that there is no basis or evidentiary support to award the

Borough's proposal. It argues:

14
There is no evidence in the record of sick time abuse. Twelve sick
days per year can hardly be said to be excessive. While there may
be some municipalities with ten sick days, there are probably twice
as many that have fifteen sick days. For example, the agreement
between Glen Rock and the PBA (U-18) provides for twenty sick
days annually, Paramus and Ridgewood provide for fifteen days
per year. (U-20; U-22), There is no basis for a reduction in sick
days in this case.

Award

Beyond the Borough's attribution of approximately 0.33% in savings that it
would receive if its proposal were awarded, there is insufficient evidence to
support this concessionary proposal. The number of sick days received is not
beyond the norm, and there is no data reflecting that there has been an

excessive use of sick leave. Accordingly, the Borough's proposal is denied

ARTICLE XVill — ATTENDANCE AT TRAINING COURSES

 

The parties have negotiated a provision governing compensation for

required attendance at in-service training courses. It states:

In the event the Chief of Police shall require any officer or
patrolman to attend a specific in-service training course for the
development of a skill not otherwise available to the Police
Department through any of its members, such officer or patrolman
shall receive compensation at a pro-rated hourly rate based upon
the appropriate salary schedule or compensatory time off equal to
the time spent in attendance at the training course, with a minimum
of 3 hours. The method of compensation shall be determined by
the Chief of Police. Nothing contained herein shall be construed as
to permit to any officer or patrolman for attendance at an in-service
course which is not specifically required to be taken as required
above.

15
The PBA seeks to modify the compensation component of Article XVIII to.

require that its members receive their overtime rate for training

The Borough urges denial of the PBA's proposal. {t submits the following

statement in opposition:

The PBA proposes that members receive their overtime rate for
training. Article XVIII, Attendance at Training Courses, provides
that officers receive compensation at a pro-rated hourly rate or
compensatory time off equal to the time spent in attendance at the
training course, subject to a minimum of three (3) hours for training.
The Chief presently determines the method of compensation. The
PBA‘s proposal will result in increased costs during the contract
term, but these costs are too speculative to calculate because the
Borough does not know the number of heurs its police officers will
spend attending training during the successor contract term.

The 2010 Amendments also bar an award of the PBA’s training
compensation proposal, NJ.S.A. § 34:13A-16.7(b) precludes the
arbitrator from rendering an award that includes non-salary
economic issues which were not included in the predecessor
agreement. Because the PBA’s training compensation proposal
has economic ramifications, it constitutes a “non-salary economic
issue" within the meaning of the 2010 Amendments. The 2010
Amendments therefore preclude an award of the PBA's training
compensation proposal

Award

| need not address the Borough's argument that N.J.S.A, § 34:13A-16.7(b)
precludes the awarding of this non-salary economic issue. The PBA has not
sustained its burden of establishing sufficient merit upon which to award the

proposal to require overtime for required training. The existing provision appears

16
to have been negotiated with proper balance given to the competing interests
involved, including the requirement that a minimum of three hours be paid for any

participation in required training. Accordingly, the PBA’s proposal is denied

PRIVATE DUTY RATE

 

The Agreement does not specify the amount of payment to be received by
an officer for off-duty or private duty authorized work to be performed. The
Borough has proposed to increase the private duty rate from $70 to $86 per hour

and has already implemented its proposal. It notes that:

Because the Borough is compensated by the outside contractor for
private duty costs, this proposal does not increase the Borough's
costs. The increase in the private duty rate, however, is a
substantial benefit for PBA members.

The PBA observes:

The employer passed an ordinance making the change and the
PBA did not oppose it. It was not part of the negotiations process.
Even if the employer argues that it was part of negotiations, it must
be determined that the increase was stipulated between the parties
as it has already gone into effect. If the employer were to
untlaterally lower this rate it would be subject to challenge by the
PBA. The PBA has no issue with the arbitrator finding this point
moot or stipulated between the parties.

Award

Given the parties’ mutual acknowledgement that there is no dispute as to

the increase in the private duty rate, | will award the Borough's proposal in a
fashion similar to having received a stipulation as authorized by NJS.A. §

34:13A-169(4).

HEALTH INSURANCE

Both parties have advanced proposals that deal with health insurance:

They will be reviewed individually.

Health Insurance Employee Contributions
(PBA Proposal)

 

Asticle VIIKB) obligates employees to contribute towards payment of
medical prescription and dental insurance in accordance with the provisions of
state law. The PBA has proposed to reduce employee contributions for medical
insurance by 50% commencing January 1, 2016. It supports its proposal as

follows:

The PBA proposes 4 fifty percent (50%) reduction in the medical
contributions that members make to their healthcare starting in
2016. All of the members of the PBA are contributing the full
amount of the medical care contribution as stated in Chapter 78
Chapter 78 states:

‘Once those employees are subjected to the contribution
requirements set forth in subsection a. of this section,
the public employers and public employees shall be
bound by this act . . . to apply the contribution levels set
forth in section 39 of this act until ail affected employees
are contributing the full amount of the contribution, as
determined by the implementation schedule set forth in
subsection a. of this section, Notwithstanding the
expiration date set forth in section 83 of this act . . . or
the expiration of any successor agreements, parties

18
shall _be hound to apply the requirements of this
paragraph _until_they have reached the full

implementation of the schedule set_forth_in
Subsection a, of this section.

 

 

Specifically, N.J.S.A. 40A:10-21.2 states:

After full implementation, those contribution levels shall
become part of the parties’ collective negotiations and
shall then be subject to collective negotiations in a
manner similar to other negotiable items between the
parties.

Section 83 of Chapter 78, P.L. 2041 states:

This act shall take effect immediately, and sections 39

through 44, inclusive, shall expire four years after the
effective date

The effective date of the statute, N.J.S.A. 40A:10-21.2 was June
28, 2011. It is now expired. The contribution amounts are
negotiable. While there is a cap on salary increases, there is no
reason why an adjustment cannot be made to the healthcare
contribution in order to balance out the financial impact of the two
percent cap. As a result of the salary cap the members will not be
receiving their full step increases and those at the top step will be
getting a very small increase. A reduction in the contribution would
at least allow the members to have more money at their disposal,
although not part of salary with all of the benefits associated with
that.

As a result of the salary cap combined with the health care
contributions, the officers, especially those at top pay, have seen a
reduction in actual money they take home. Officers at top pay may
not get a raise over the course of a contract, yet they have been
paying approximately $10,000 for a family plan. The contribution is
Negotiable and it is appropriate to make an adjustment to the
contribution tevels in this case. The parties jointly developed a
salary guide which led to a couple bubble steps which have the
result of using up most of the available money for any monetary
raise. This was not just the fault of the PBA, yet the PBA members
bear the brunt of its harsh results. There is no doudt that at some
point in the past, the employer benefitted from pushing off raises
which led to the bubble steps. Now, is attempting ta get another
benefit by essentially blaming the large increases in those bubble
steps on the PBA. The employer wants 2 new salary scale forever

19
delaying the contractual salaries while maintaining the inordinately
high medical contribution levels.

While it Is understood that the PBA can only propose salary
adjustments in accordance with the cap statute, it is within the
Powers of the arbitrator to adjust the medical contribution, Such an
adjustment would be an equitable adjustment to the stagnant
salaries and regressive legislation which the members of the PBA
have been subject to for the past several years.

The medical contribution is an ever rising cost to both the PBA
members and the employer. However, the PBA members have no
means to obtain more money to pay for their contribution other than
money available through negotiations and arbitration The
employer, on the other hand, can obtain more money, if necessary.

The Borough objects to the PBA’s proposal and submits that the proposal
the PBA has presented is pre-empted by law. It offers the following arguments in

support of its position:

Because the PBA's collective bargaining agreement expired on
December 31, 2011, after Chapter 78 took effect, the contribution,
subject to a 4-year phase in at 25% per year, took effect in January
2012, Employees contributed at first year percentages in 2012,
second year percentages in 2013, and third year percentages in
2014. Employees contribute at fourth year percentages in 2015,
the first year of the successor contract determined by this interest
arbitration,

The Interest Arbitrator cannot implement the PBA’s health
insurance proposal to reduce employee contributions by 50%
effective January 1, 2016 because the PBA's proposal is
preempted by N.J.S.A. § 40A:10-21.2; the PBA cannot negotiate a
change in employee contribution amounts until the contract after full
implementation of the fourth year. NuJ.S.A. § 40A:10-21.2
provides, in relevant part,

A_public_employer_and employees _who_are_in
negotiations for _the next collective negotiation
agreement to be executed after the employees in that
unit have reached full implementation of the premium
share set forth in section 39 of PL. 2011, ¢. 78
(G.52:14-17,28c) shall conduct negotiations conceming

 

 

20
contributions for health care benefits as if the full
premium share was included in the prior contract,

After full implementation, those contribution levels shail
become part of the parties’ collective negotiations and
shall then be subject to collective negotiations in a
manner similar to other negotiable items between the
parties.

Id. (emphasis added). Negotiations conceming contribution to
premiums therefore cannot occur until the collective negotiations
agreement after full implementation.

Local Finance Notice 2011-20R supports this interpretation. It
provides,

The law provides directive language that affects the
negotiations of CNA’s ater full implementation of health
benefits contribution ‘Once the fourth year has
been completed (100% of the required contribution has
been paid for a year), the law provides that

a. Negotiations for the next contract shall be
conducted as if the full contribution was part of the
previous contract.
Once... [there is] full implementation, the
contribution structure is negotiable, starting from the
point of full implementation.

Exhibit 7 at 11-12. Therefore, the Local Finance Notice provides
further support that the law bars negotiation of a reduction in
contribution to premiums until the collective bargaining agreement
after full implementation of four years of contributions,

Moreover, in Clementon Board of Education and Clementon
Education Association, PERC. No. 2016-10, 42 NJPER (ff

2018), attached as Exhibit 8, PERC held that a proposal
made in negotiations for a successor collective bargaining
agreement to reduce employee health insurance premium
contributions was preempted by N..S.A. § 18A:16-17.2. This
statutory section contains identical language to N.J.S.A. § 40A:10-
21.2. the statute applicable to municipal police officers, among
other public employees

 

 

In Clementon, the parties had a three year collective bargaining
agreement with a term from July 1, 2011 through June 30, 2014

241
Chapter 78 became effective on June 28, 2011. Unit employees
began their required four years of contributions upon the expiration
of the predecessor contract at the first level on July 1, 2011. On
July 1, 2014, the first year of the successor collective bargaining
agreement under negotiations, the employees began their fourth
year of contributions. The union proposed that employee
contribution to premiums should be reduced to 1.5% of base salary
after full implementation of Chapter 78. In quoting NUSA. §
18A:16-17.2, which contains identical language to NJSA. §
40A:10-21.2, the statute applicable to municipal police officers,
PERC held that the health insurance reduction proposal was
preempted until negotiations for the agreement that followed full
implementation. The parties could, therefore, negotiate regarding a
reduction in health insurance contributions in the next contract
negotiations. See Exhibit 8. As in Clementon, the parties are in
negotiations with one year remaining to achieve full implementation
of Chapter 78, This fourth year will occur under the successor
agreement presently under negotiations. Therefore, NSA. §
40A:10-21.2 preempts negotiation of a reduction of premium
contribution rates until after full implementation of Chapter 78: i.e.,
upon the expiration of the successor contract, depending on the
duration of the successor contract awarded, The Interest Arbitrator
should therefore decline to award the PBA's proposal to reduce
employee health insurance contributions by 50% effective January
1, 2016

Award

The PBA forcefully argues that the legislative imposition of health
insurance contributions is “fegressive” and that relief is necessary through
negotiated reductions in contribution levels. The statute preempts negotiations
but provides language that lifts the preemption in favor of negotiations with the
statutory levels serving as the status quo. The parties dispute the point in time in

which the issue will become negotiable

22
NuJS.A. § 34:13A-16g(5) requires the arbitrator to apply the lawlul

 

authority of the employer and NJS.A. § 34:13A-169(9) requires application of

 

statutory restrictions on the employer. Given this, | am required to adhere to the
statute and existing case law that governs when the issue of health insurance
contributions becomes negotiable. The Borough's contention is persuasive that,
given the relevant facts of this case, the PERC decision in Clementon Board of

Education and Clementon Education Association, PE.R.C. No. 2016-10, 42

 

NUPER __ (f 2015), governs this issue and, therefore, the PBA's
proposal is preempted by law and cannot be awarded. Accordingly, the proposal

is denied.

Health Insurance Plans
(Borough Proposal)

Article VIII(A) obligates the Borough to provide medical and hospitalization
coverage in accordance with the “BMED" (Bergen Municipal Employees Benefit
Fund). It proposes to switch this coverage to the Aetna PPO 20/35 Plan. It

offers the following explanation in support of its proposal

The Borough proposes to amend Ariicle Xill, Medical, Dental and
Life Insurance with respect to health insurance benefits for active
employees and for retirees. Specifically, for active employees, the
Borough wants to provide that BMED 20/36 Plan will be the highest
cost plan offered effective on January 1, 2016. The Borough does
not provide health insurance through the State Health Benefits Plan
(‘SHBP’). Instead. the Borough participates in the Bergen
Municipal Employees Benefit Fund (‘BMED"), a Health Insurance
Fund (‘HIF"). The plans. they offer are designed to “match” the
plans offered under SHBP, giving rise to the plan names.
Presently, the Borough provides employees and their dependents

23
with a choice of nine plans. All PBA members who have not
waived medical insurance coverage selected medical and
hospitalization coverage under the BMED Direct 10 Match Plan, the
highest cost plan the Borough offers. To contain the spiraling costs
of health insurance, the Borough proposes to offer the Aetna PPO.
20/35 Plan as its highest cost plan, In 2016, using an estimated
increase in insurance premiums, the Borough would save about
$29,447 from the plan change. See Cost Comparison, Direct 10
Match vs. Aetna PPO 20/35 Plan at E-1, Section 5. This
represents a savings of 1.58% ($29,447/$1,852,333 x 100) in 2016.
Using estimates based on an 8% annual increase in premium costs
and assuming no changes in selected plan coverage (ie., single,
family, etc.) the Borough would save $132,691 over the remaining
four years of the contract. See E-1, Section 5. Employees would
save $37,426 over the remaining four years of the contract term in
premium contributions. See E-1, Section 5. Because cost savings
are speculative, the Borough cannot definitively calculate the
savings this proposal would bring to the Borough.

The PBA objects to the Borough's proposal. It argues:

The change proposed by the employer for medical coverage has
been somewhat addressed above, It is clear from the submissions
that the employer is solely concemed with keeping the premiums
down in anticipation of the Cadillac Tax. As stated above, a three
year contract will give the parties the opportunity to negotiate over
health care benefits when itis better known If this tax is going to. go
into effect. A change to the BMED 20/35 plan is not warranted and
not supported by the evidence. The employer has only provided
the fact that the plan is cheaper. Cheaper does not, on its face,
establish that the plan is equal to the benefits currently in effect
Without a thorough and detailed presentation on the intricacies of
the plan, there is no way to measure the financial effect of changing
plans. While the premiums may be lower, there most certainly will
be other increased costs which allowed the premium to be lowered.
Co-pay costs, deductible amounts, out-of-network costs etc., must
all be considered when evaluating a health care plan. The mere
assertion that the premiums are less does not suffice to make a
drastic change to the benefits.

24
Award

The Borough has presented a proposal supported by the cost savings to
be achieved. The amounts stated in the Borough's arguments are consistent
with representations made at hearing. It points out that employees would also
save due to decreased premium costs upon which their contribution levels are
based. These savings are actual in contrast with speculative savings that could
arise from the projected imposition of the “Cadillac tax.” Although the PBA
alleges an absence of evidence as to the detailed nature of plan design change,
the record does not support this argument. The proposed plan has, without
objection, been presented as one that provides comprehensive health care
coverage that patterns the New Jersey State Health Benefits Plan. The interests
and welfare of the public are not furthered by the Borough having to continue to
bear the burdensome costs of health care coverage under the existing plan

Accordingly. | award the Borough's proposal.

Retire Health Benefits
(Borough Proposals)

The Agreement, at Article VIII(D) provides for retiree health insurance. It

states:

For employees who retire after twenty (20) years of service to the
Borough and twenty-five (25) years in the pension system, the
Borough will provide full (100%) medical insurance, dental,
prescription, and family or spousal coverage, at the same level of
such benefits received at the time of retirement. Insurance
coverage for fully relied (25 years of service) employees, as

25
authorized herein, is secondary to any coverage or benefits
available or which may become available from Medicare or any
other sources of insurance, governmental or — otherwise.
Additionally, such coverage as may be provided by the Borough,
will be discontinued for any period when insurance coverage is
obtained as a result of other employment, but will be reinstated
upon the termination of such employment.

The Borough seeks to modify the above provision as follows:

The Borough proposes two modifications to retiree health benefits.
First, the Borough proposes, effective on the date of the award,
new hires receive medical coverage from their retirement until they
reach age 65. Presently, officers receive medical coverage upon
their retirement for life, secondary to any coverage which becomes
available from Medicare or any other source. An award of this
proposal will result in significant savings to the Borough, but those
savings are too speculative to calculate.

Second, the Borough proposes to amend the contract language in
Paragraph D to provide that employees retiring on or after
December 31, 2019 will receive the same level of benefits as
provided to then-current employees. Presently, Paragraph D
provides, “For employees who retire after twenty (20) years of
service to the Borough and twenty-five years in the pension system,
the Borough will provide full (100%) medical insurance, dental,
prescription, and family or spousal coverage, at the same level of
such benefits received at the time of retirement.” (emphasis added)
The PBA interprets this language to mean that the Borough must
provide an employee who, by way of example, retired in 1985 with
the same health insurance benefits today as the employee received
in 1985 at the time he retired. The Borough finds this obligation
unworkable given the realities of today’s medical insurance market.
Not only is the level of benefits provided years ago cost prohibitive,
but pians providing such benefits may no longer exist. The
Borough's proposal will enable retirees to receive health insurance
benefits in tune with today’s insurance market by tying the level of
benefits provided to retirees to the level of benefits provided to
then-current employees. An award of this proposal wil! result in
significant savings to the Borough, but those savings are too
speculative to calculate.

The PBA objects to the Borough's proposals. It submits:

26
The employer is seeking to amend the contract to limit retiree
benefits for those members retiring afler December 31, 2019 to the
level of benefits provided to current employees. Again, there has
been no evidence submitted in support of such a drastic change to
benefits. Health benefits are extremely valuable. There is no way
to tell what the future will bring with regard to these benefits. When
discussing retiree benefits we are discussing health care twenty or
thirty years from now. That would be completely unpredictable. In
the future employees may give up employer health care for some
other benefit. Where would that leave retirees? With no benefits?
Such an open ended, speculative proposal must be denied

This is also true for the proposal to end medical coverage at sixty-
five for new hires. There is still a cost associated with health care
after sixty-five. Members will have to purchase additional health
care plans such as Medicare Part B, to get complete coverage.
The employer is simply trying to ay that cost off on the employee
without any basis for doing so.

Award

I do not award either aspect of the Borough's proposals. Retiree health
insurance is an issue that can be revisited without prejudice to the Borough in
future negotiations after presenting a detailed review of the costs associated with
having to provide individual retiree health benefit plans for all retirees who are
subject to heaith insurance coverage. It is noted that the Borough's proposal, if
awarded, would not be effective until December 31, 2019. Thus, the December
31, 2018 contract duration awarded permits sufficient time for the renewal of

negotiations on this issue.

27
SALARY

The Borough and the PBA have widely divergent positions on salary.
These include the amount of salary that can be awarded under the statutory cap.
the proper method for calculating those amounts and the structure of the salary

schedules to be awarded.

The first point of analysis is the structure of the existing salary schedules.
They are divided into three (3) separate schedules depending upon date of hire.

Year 3 $64,148
Year 2 $57,976

Police Academy Basic Training $41,752

In order to place the parties’ proposals in their proper perspective, certain
observations are required to be made. First, each of the three salary schedules
covers two classes of officers, Patrolman and Sergeants. Second, each of the
Schedules provides for a salary or a step at a distinct year or years of experience
level, such as “Year 8.” It also includes bands based upon years of experience
level, such as "Years 20-24.” The two schedules involving employees hired on or
after March 28, 2012 and employees hired between January 1, 1999 and March
27, 2012 each have a Police Academy Basic Training step at $41,752 and a
Year One step of $51,804. The Year One step follows the six months that a

trainee successfully serves the Police Academy.

The salary steps, including the single salary steps and the salary bands,
suggest that an employee would advance to the next step upon achieving the
years of experience required to advance. However, in the prior contract, officers
moved only two steps in three years. Thus, as the PBA points out, “Year 8”

really was “Year 9." Article ill{A) provides language describing this structure and

30
modification to prior practice in the prior agreement, including temporary changes

in anniversary dates that normally would trigger step movement:

Except as follows, patrolmen shall become eligible for
advancement to the next higher patrolman's grade at their
anniversary date of employment as an officer with the Borough of
Franklin Lakes, During the life of this contract only, step movement
below Year 8 shall be every 18 months. For example, an employee
‘on step for Year 2 with a current anniversary date of October 15”
shall receive his next increment on April 15, 2013. The next
subsequent increment shall be on October 15, 2014, returning the
employee to the ariginal anniversary date. Upon the 2014 return to
the original anniversary date, the next subsequent increment shall
return to the twelve months interval. Upon attaining the rank of
Patrolman year 18, an officer shall be entitled to the appropriate
negotiated salary for that year, on the first day of January of each
succeeding year.

An additional factor that provides some complexity to the existing salary
schedules is the fact that in the past the parties negotiated and included a
longevity provision into the Agreement that was separate and distinct from the
salary schedules. In the last Agreement, the parties voluntarily negotiated a
process that commonly referred to as a fold-in of longevity payments into the
steps of the salary schedule. It is for this reason that the salary guides in
Appendix A provide for steps and bands that exceed the level of twenty years of
experience, including steps defined as “Years 25+" and ‘Years 28+" and bands
such as “Years 23-27." The Borough explains this transition in its post-hearing
submission:

The salary guides in the collective bargaining agreement that

expired on December 31, 2014 require explanation. See J-1 at 14-

16. Franklin Lakes appears to have a lot of steps on its salary
guide bevause lhe salary guides preserved the once separate

3M
longevity steps and incorporated them into the salary guide. The
sixteen (16) step guide for patrol officers hired after January 1,
1999 bul on of before March 27, 2012, and the nineteen (19) step.
guide for patrol officers hired on or after March 28, 2012 resulted
from the direct folding in of longevity benefits into base salary. The
steps in the salary guide that reflect folded in longevity benefits
provide significantly smaller increases than the steps that reflect
original step increases. With respect to sergeants and patrol
officers hired prior to January 1, 1999, all steps on the salary guide
reflect former longevily increases, For sergeants and patrol officers
hired between January 1, 1999 and March 27, 2012, all steps
above Year 8 reflect former longevity increases. Police Academy
Basic Training through Year 8 are true step increases, with officers
reaching maximum step at Year 8, after the completion of seven
years of service. The salary guide therefore has nine (9) steps
(Inclusive of two steps during the first year). For sergeants and
patrol officers hired on or after March 28, 2012, all steps above
Year 11 reflect former longevity increases. Police Academy Basic
Training through Year 11 are true step increases. Officers reach
maximum step after the completion of ten (10) years of service
The salary guide therefore has twelve (12) steps (inclusive of two
steps during the first year). See J-1 at 14-16.

The overview above is essential to understanding the rationale for the
parties’ respective final offers on salary and, to some extent, the basis for their
disagreements on future salary structure, including the number of steps and the
calculation of salary expenditures. Significantly, despite challenging each others’
method of calculation under the statutory salary cap, they have stipulated to the
first necessary step required for such calculation under the statute and applicable
case law. That is, that the 2014 expenditures by the Borough on 2014 base
salaries was $1,852,333 and that the cap amount of 2% that can be allotted
towards salary increases amounted to $37,047 in 2046. It is noted that that
amount is now allowed to be compounded annually so the total amount for a four

year agreement, by way of example, is $37,047, $37,789, $38,543 and $39,315

32
or a total of $152,694. The statute also authorizes the arbitrator to apportion
yearly amounts in a manner that equals this sum but permits its distribution in

varying annual amounts

The extent to which the parties have disagreement over salaries despite
their concurrence on the applicability of the statutory salary cap, the gross
amounts paid out in salary for 2014 and the amounts that equate to 2%, is
evident in three major respects. The first disagreement is what the number of
steps should be on the new salary guides. The PBA proposes no change in the
number of steps. It instead focuses on the amounts of salary that it believes
each officer should be individually awarded in order to stay within the 2% cap. In
contrast, the Borough proposes to add nine steps to the salary guide for
members hired between January 1, 1999 and March 27, 2012 and to add eight
steps to the salary guide for members hired on or after March 28, 2012. The
added steps are said to be necessary in order to advance an officer to a higher

‘step but to render that step smaller in order to stay within the cap.

The second disagreement is over what individual officer salaries or
amounts should be included or excluded from salary cap calculations. By way of
example, there are sharp disagreements over salary calculations that concern
two police officers. These officers are Patroiman Pelligrino and former Patrolman
Albert. The parties have addressed these disputes in their written post-hearing

submissions. The PBA argues the following

33
With regard to the calculations on either the PBA proposed salary
guide or the employer's propesed guide, there are fundamental
disagreements. The first disagreement is with Officer Pelligrino.
The employer has included him in their calculations for the two
percent cap and, more importantly, against the cap for his
movement through the salary guide. On December 31, 2014
Officer Pelligrino was in the police academy. He was not a police
officer or patrolman, nor was he a member of the PBA until after he
graduated the academy. While it is true that there was a salary
step for the Academy, he was not covered under the collective
bargaining agreement until after he had graduated the Academy.
Article |, Covered Personnel, states:

This Agreement shall apply to all full time Officers and
Patrolmen of the Department employed by the Borough,
and the exception of the ranks of Chief, Captain, and
Lieutenant.

NJ.S.A. 34:134-16.7 states in relevant part:

b. An arbitrator shall not render any award pursuant to
section 3 of P.L.1977, c. 85(C.34:13A-16) which, in the
first year of the collective negotiation agreement
awarded by the arbitrator, increases base salary items
oy more than 2.0 percent of the aggregate amount
expended by the public employer on base salary items
for_the members of the affected employee
organization_in the twelve months immediately
Preceding the expiration of the _ collective
negotiation agreement subject to arbitration.

 

 

 

 

There is no question that Pellegrino was not a “member of the
affected employee organization” on December 31, 2014
Additionally, on the effective date of the new agreement, January 1,
2015, he was not a police officer, patrolman, or member of the
PBA, Finally, Pellegrino was treated differently than all of the
members of the PBA. When he was finally sworn in as a police
officer and became a member of the bargaining unit, he was placed
on the first step of the salary guide. It was also at that time, April 1,
2015, that he was enrolled in the Police and Firemen’s Retirement
System (‘PFRS”). (U-25). Alll police officers are required to be
enrolled in the PFRS. Pellegrino was not, under the law, permitted
to be enrolled in the PERS because he was not a police officer until
he completed the Academy. If he was a member of the bargaining
unit why did the employer change his salary. yet freeze everyone
else? The answer is simple. When he was sworn in as a police

34
officer, the Borough had to put him at the starting salary for police
officers. Pellegrino’s salary increases should not be part of the
money available under (he lwo percent salary cap.

The second issue concems the status of Officer Albert who has left
the police department and is no longer employed by the Borough
Albert only worked for a few months in the beginning of 2015 and
then left to go work for another department. It is acknowledged that
the Commission has addressed this Issue, however, the facts of
this case are different from the cases addressed by PERC
previously, In Borough of New Milford and PBA Local 83, 38
NJPER 71116 (2012), the Commission wrote

 

Since an arbitrator, under the new law, is required to
project costs for the entirety of the duration of the award,
calculation of purported savings resulting from
anticipated retirements, and for that matter added costs
due to replacement by hiting new staff or promoting
existing staff are ail too speculative to be calculated at
the time of the award. The Commission believes that the
better model to achieve compliance with P.L. 2010 c
105 is to utilize the scattergram demonstrating the
placement on the guide of all of the employees in the
bargaining unit as of the end of the year preceding the
initiation of the new contract, and to simply move those
employees forward through the newly awarded salary
scales and longevity entitlements.

In this case, Albert leaving the department is not speculative. It has
already occurred. He is no longer an employee of the Borough.
The arbitrator is mandated to project costs for the duration of the
award. Using a salary for a person who is not an employee does
not further that mandate. In fact, it would automatically create a
false projection. tt would add approximately $180,000 of spending
that does not exist. In a relatively small unit, like this one, that
would completely change the projected costs. Finally, since the
PBA’s proposal is done by providing salaries for the individual
officers, if it is necessary to put Albert on the list of officers, the PBA
proposes he gets no increases for the duration of the contract.

The Borough disagrees with the PBA’s method of calculation concerning

Officers Pelligrino and Albert and contends that its own method of calculation is

35
more consistent with the statute and the PERC case law in regard to the proper

method of calculation. The Borough submits:

The PBA does not calculate the cost of its demands in accordance
with applicable law. First, the PBA’s calculations are fiawed
because the PBA failed to include Officer Albert's salary costs in
the successor contract term. See Exhibit 2. Officer Albert resigned
on July 13, 2015, six and one-half months into the successor
contract term. In accordance with New Milford, 38 NJPER at 340
and Borough of Ramsey, 39 NJPER 17, discussed above, which
directs that separations, retirements, and promotions that occur
during the successor contract term do not affect calculations,
Officer Albert's salary costs must be carried through the successor
contract term as if he remained employed. The PBA's decision to
omit Officer Albert's salary costs illegally frees up $51,804 for
salary increases for other officers.

Moreover, as discussed above, the PBA erred in failing to include
Officer Pellegrino in its calculations. See Exhibit 2. In contrast to
the PBA’s contention, the cost of Officer Pellegrino's base salary
must be included in the calculations for the successor contract term
because he was employed by the Borough as of December 31,
2014. The PBA offers no authority in support of its position that
Officer Pellegrino should not be included because he was in the
academy for his first six months of hire and thus not a “swom”
officer as of December 31, 2014. To the contrary, Officer
Pellegrino is a member of the PBA unit. His salary at the first step
of the salary guide, “Police Academy Basic Training,” was governed
by the salary guide in the PBA collective bargaining agreement and
his salary was paid by the Borough. It is irrelevant to the analysis
that Officer Pellegrino had not yet been swom in as a police officer
as of December 31, 2014. Officer Pellegrino, the most junior
officer, receives the largest increases throughout the successor
contract term, His increases total 40.50% over three years (using
Borough figures with applicable mid-year salary increases) or
38.86% (using PBA figures). Omitting Officer Pellegrino frees up
$16,224 (using PBA figures) which falls within the 2.0% cap,
illegally making $16,224 available to increase the base salaries for
the other officers, See Exhibit 3

The third main area of disagreement is over the amounts of salary that

each has attributed lo the olher party's proposal. The Borough calculates the

36
costs of the PBA’s proposal for 2015, 2018 and 2017 as 3.53%, 5.51% and
1.01% respectively, amounts that il alleges far exceed the cap. The PBA rejects
the Borough's calculations and submits that its own calculations, according to its
methodology, fall within the 2% statutory cap. As previously stated, the PBA also
ejects the manner in which the Borough has calculated its own proposals
because it views the Borough as having charged to the cap certain rollovers from

one year to the next, especially with regard to the first year.

Because | do not award either party's salary proposal, it is unnecessary to
engage in a detailed analysis as to the merits of each party's arguments that
center on disagreeing with the other parly's method of caloulation. | am duty
bound to render an award that does not exceed the 2% salary cap based upon
$1,852,333 on 2014 base salaries that yields a cap amount of $37,047 over the
course of the new contract plus a compounded amount for each successive
contract year after the initial contract year and to make those calculations based
upon the required methodology established by PERC. As | have previously
found, these amounts are $37,047 and $37,789 and $38,543 and $39,315 or a

total of $152,694. N.J.S.A. 34:134-16,7 permits the distribution of the aggregate

 

Monetary value of the award in unequal annual percentages to be not greater

than the compounded value of a 2% increase per year.

In deciding the application of these amounts, | am bound by PERC case

law as set forth in Borough of New Milford, P.E.R.C. No. 2012-53, 38 NUPER 340

State_of New Jersey and FOP Lodge 91, P.E.R.C. NO. 2016-11 (2016).

 

pertinent part, it stated the following

P.L.2010, ¢.105 amended the interest arbitration law, imposing a
2% “Hard Cap” on annual base salary increases for afbitration
awards where the preceding collective negotiations agreement
(CNA) or award expired after December 31, 2010 through April 1,
2014. P.L.2014, ¢.11, signed June 24, 2044 and retroactive to April
2, 2014, amended the interest arbitration law and extended the 2%
salary cap, along with other changes, to December 31, 2017.
NULS.A, 34:134-16.7 provides:

Definitions relative to police and fire arbitration;
limitation on awards.

a. As used in this section:

“Base salary" means the salary provided pursuant to
a salary guide or table and any amount provided
pursuant to a salary increment, including any amount
provided for longevity or length of service, It also shall
include any other item agreed to by the parties, or any
other item that was included in the base salary as
understood by the parties in the prior contract. Base
salary shall not include non-salary economic issues,
pension and health and medical insurance costs

“Non-salary economic issues” means any economic
issue that is not included in the definition of base
salary.

b, An arbitrator shall not render any award pursuant to
section 3 of P.L.1977, 6.85 (C.34:13A-16) which, in
the first year of the collective negotiation agreement
awarded by the arbitrator, increases base salary
items by more than 2.0 percent of the aggregate
amount expended by the public employer on base
salary items for the members of the affected
employee organization in the twelve months
immediately preceding the expiration of the collective

38

In
negotiation agreement subject to arbitration. In each
subsequent year of the agreement awarded by the
arbitrator, base salary items shall nol be incteased by
more than 2.0 percent of the aggregate amount
expended by the public employer on base salary
items for the members of the affected employee
organization in the immediately preceding year of the
agreement awarded by the arbitrator

The parties may agree, or the arbitrator may decide,
to distribute the aggregate monetary value of the
award over the term of the collective negotiation
agreement in unequal annual percentage increases,
which shall not be greater than the compounded
value of a 2.0 percent increase per year over the
corresponding length of the collective negotiation
agreement. An award of an arbitrator shall not include
base salary items and non-salary economic issues
which were not included in the prior collective
negotiations agreement,

In Borough of New Milford, P.E.R.C. No. 2012-53, 38 NJPER 340
{1116 2012), we modified our review standard to include a
determination of whether the arbitrator established that the award
would not exceed the Hard Cap. ... [T]he Commission has
consistently authorized the arbitrator's approach to calculating
increases in base salary items for those unit members remaining in
the unit after the base year. In New Milford, the Commission
endorsed the following method for “costing out’ an_ interest
arbitration award within the parameters of the 2% Hard Cap:

Since an arbitrator, under the new law, is required to
project costs for the entirety of the duration of the
award, calculation of purported savings resulting from
anticipated retirements, and for that matter added
costs due to replacement by hiring new staff or
promoting existing staff are all too speculative to be
calculated at the time of the award. The Commission
believes that the better model to achieve compliance
with P.L. 2010 ¢. 105 is to_ulilize the scatterqram
demonstrating the placement on the guide of all of the
employees in the bargaining unit as of the end of the
year preceding the initiation of the new contract_and
lo simply move those employees forward through the
newly awarded salary scales and longevity
entitlements. Thus, both reductions in costs resulting

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

39
from retirements or otherwise, as well _as any
increases _in_costs_ stemming from promotions or
additional new hires would not effegt tbe costing out
of the award required by the new amendments to the
Interest Arbitration Reform Act.

 

 

 

 

(New Milford at 344, emphasis added]

In Borough of Ramsey, P.E.R.C. No. 2012-60, 39 NUPER 17 (3
2012), we rejected the union's assertion that the arbitrator should
have taken into account a recent retirement and recent promotions
when projecting salary costs in the award, finding:

In New Milford, we determined that reductions in
costs resulting from retirements or otherwise, or
increases in costs stemming from promotions or
additional new hires, should not affect the costing out
of the award. N.J.S.A_ 34:13a-16.7(b} speaks only to
establishing a baseline for the aggregate amount
expended by the public employer on base salary
items for the twelve_months immediately preceding
the expiration of the collective negotiation agreement
subject to arbitration. The statute does not provide for
a majority representative to be credited with savings
that_a public employer receives from any reduction in
sosts. nor does it provide for the _maiority
fepresentative to be debited for any increased costs
the public employer assumes for promotions or other
costs associated with maintaining its workforce.

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

[Ramsey at 20, emphasis added)

| am bound by the methodology set forth in the above case law and will
apply it to the salary award. | next apply the evidence of this case to the
statutory criteria and the statutory salary cap. Initially, | note that the salary cap
does not in every case automatically determine what the salary result should be.
lis relevance and applicability in an arbitration proceeding is dependent on
whether the evidence points to the probability that, in the absence of the cap, an

amount that could exceed the cap could potentially be justified. In the instant

40
case, the PBA has produced credible evidence that supports an award that could
excced the cap. | need not proceed beyond the fact that normal movernent on
the salary guide in accordance with its own terms, even without any increase to
the salary guides, would require funds that exceed the cap. Moreover, the
Borough does not contend that an award that expends funds up to the cap
limitation would compel it to exceed the tax cap levy or create adverse financial
impact on the Borough, The percentages that represent the cap is generally
consistent with the cost of living data. Even if such data exceeded the cap, the
data would be irrelevant because it could not support an award that exceeds the
cap. In short, an award less than what could lawfully be awarded would not
represent a reasonable determination of the salary issue. Further, comparability
evidence reflects interest arbitration awards in the County have resulted in salary
increases that are at the level of the statutory salary cap. Voluntary settlements
can exceed the cap but are of no evidentiary value given the requirements that
awarded salary increases cannot exceed the statutory salary cap. The most
compelling criteria are the interests and welfare of the public (N.J.S.A. 34:13A-
16g(1)), the lawful authority of the employer (N.J.S.A. 34:13A-16g(5)) and the
statutory restriction on the employer (N.JLS.A. 34:13A-16g(9)). These criteria
lead to the conclusion that salary increases are warranted but only to the extent
allowable by law. Accordingly, the salary award will be the maximum of what can
lawfully be awarded and thus, compel expenditures up to, but not in excess of,

the statutory salary cap.

41
Due to the requirements of the statutory salary cap, unit employees
cannot be moved through the salary guides even after they have met contractual
eligibility standards to do so, even if all of the steps on the salary guides were to
temain frozen for four years. The obvious reason, as is known to the parties, is
that the costs of step movement alone exceed the amounts of funds that can be
awarded. Simply put, the large number of existing steps on the salary guide that
would require greater monies than what can be awarded to fund incremental

movements toward the maximum step. | next turn to the parties’ proposals.

| decline to award the Borough's proposal due to the significant increase in
the number of steps that the Borough would add to the salary guides that already
have a higher than average number of steps. The additional 9 and 8 steps to be
added to two of the existing salary schedules cannot be justified and would stand
in stark contrast to the number of steps contained in comparable salary
schedules, | also decline to award the PBA’s proposal because, as it is
calculated, the amounts necessary to fund the proposal would require this award
to exceed the statutory salary cap pursuant to the mandates set forth in
applicable case law. In particular, the PBA does not include Officer Peligrino in
its cost projections. It removes the costs of Officer Albert who separated from

employment during the 2016 contract year.

Officer Pelligrino’s salary of $41,752 for 2014 was determined by his

placement on the third salary schedule (Employees hired on or after March 28,

42
2012) at the Police Academy Basic Training step upon his September 25, 2014
date of hire. This salary schedule has a Year 1 step of $51,804 that Officer
Pelligrino moved to on March 25, 2014. Applicable case law requires that Officer
Pelligrino’s salary increases in 2015 beyond where he was placed on the
December 31. 2014 scattergram must be charged to the 2% cap. The PBA's
contention that he was not in the bargaining unit on January 1, 2018 is
understandable because it would avoid his 2015 increase to be charged to the
cap. However, this contention is inconsistent with the fact that his original
placement on the Police Academy Basic Training step was the result of the
negotiated salary schedule. it also runs counter to the applicable case law cited
above:

[Jo utllize the scattergram demonstrating the placement on the

guide of all of the employees in the bargaining unit as of the end of

the year preceding the initiation of the new contract, and to simply

move those employees forward through the newly awarded salary

scales and longevity entitlements.

Borough of New Milford and PBA Local 83, 38 NJPER [116 (2012)

 

The PBA’s contention with respect to Officer Albert is also without merit. His
separation from employment during 2015 does not allow for a subtraction of his
$51,804 salary from the amounts the Borough was required to project to spend
due to his employment at $51,804 on the December 31, 2014 scattergram. As

stated in New Milford:

{BJoth reductions in costs resulting from retirements or otherwise,
as well as any increases in costs stemming from promotions or
additional new hires would net effect the costing out of the award

43
required by the new amendments to the Interest Arbitration Reform
Act.

See also, Borough of Ramsey:

The statute does not provide for a majority representative to be
credited with savings that a public employer receives from any
reduction in costs, nor does it provide for the majority
representative to be debited for any increased costs the public
employer assumes for promotions or other costs associated with
maintaining its workforce.

Borough of Ramsey, P.E.R.C. No. 2012-60, 39 NJPER 17 (13
2012)

This methodology, as required by PERG case law, was applied by this arbitrator

in State_of New Jersey and New Jersey Law Enforcement Supervisors

 

 

This matter was appealed and affirmed by PERC [P.E.R.C. No. 2014-60] on

March.

ion, PERC Dkt. No. IA-2014-003, decided January 21, 2014. That case

Significantly, the aggregate amount of what is the maximum
allowable amount must be placed on the scattergram, or number of
employees, who are employed as of the last date of the contract
year of contract expiration on June 30, 2011. PERC then requires
the aggregate amount to be distributed to that scattergram over the
entire contract period as if all of the employees continued to be
employed without any impact from new hires or retirements.

10, 2014. In that decision, PERC held:

We affirm the arbitrator's salary award and find that his selection of
the State’s scattergram is consistent with our direction in New
Milford. We reject NJLESA's argument that the savings realized by
the State in FY 12 and 13 are to be credited to the unit, As we
indicated in New Milford, the base salary calculation may nol
increase by more than 2% per year, or 6% in the aggregale for a
three year contract award, the amount expended by the employer
in the last year of the prior agreement. NJ.S.A. 34:13A-16.7(b)
Whether speculative or known, we again hold that any changes in
financial circumstances benefitting the employer or majority
fepresentative are not contemplated by the statute or to be
considered by the arbitrator. See Borough of Ramsey (Holding that
the interest arbitration statute does not provide for a majority
Tepresentative to be credited with savings that a public employer
receives from any reduction in costs in the new contract years)
We also note that we have recently reversed the dynamic status
que doctrine as a matter of Commission policy and no longer
require employers to pay salary increments upon contract
expiration. See Atlantic County, P.E.R.C. No. 2014-40, __ NJPER

— (L_ 2013), app. pending: and State-Operated School Dist._of
the City of Paterson, P.E.R.C. No. 2014-46, NJPER (712014)

 

Accordingly, for 2015, the cap amount of $37,047 shall be awarded and
applied to the salaries and personnel included in the December 21, 2014
scattergram that contained base salary costs of $1,762,514. Because Officer
Pelligrino was advanced to the Year 1 step at $51,804 on March 26, 2018, the
costs between his $41,752 salary on December 31, 2014 and his $51,804
prorated salary for 2015, the amount of $7,516 for year 2015 must be included
within the $37,047. | have apportioned the remainder of the amount that can be

awarded in 2015 ($29,531) in the following manner and for the following reasons.

' have concluded that a reasonable determination of the salary issue
should be one that does not expand the existing number of steps on the salary
schedules either in 2015 or in the remaining contract years and requires that

each unit employee remain on his or her step as of the December 31, 2014

® Omicer Pelligrino was the only officer to be moved on the salary schedule during 2018. All
others were frozen and there are no step cost increases associated with any other employee.

 

45
scattergram throughout the contract duration. Although unit officers cannot
receive their full amount of step increases, the maintenance of the existing salary
structure will contribute to facilitating the parties’ future salary negotiations with or
without the existence of a statutory cap on salary increases. Because the
amounts that can be awarded cannot cover what the normal step increases
would have required, | find that a common method of distribution for all unit
employees is the most reasonable and equitable approach towards the salary
increases. Accordingly, the remaining $29,531 shall be evenly distributed to the
steps occupied by employees on December 31, 2014 in equal dollar amounts to
each step on each of the three salary schedules by the addition of $1,555 to
each step effective January 1, 2015. To do othenwise could result in selective
and disproportionate increases being awarded to various unit employees to the

detriment of a majority of the others.

| award an identical method of distribution of salary cap monies for 2016,
2017 and 2018. This method of distribution would continue to award increases in
equal dollar amounts as the most reasonable and equitable method of
distribution. Each unit member, defined as all employees receiving a salary as
determined by their placement on a step set forth in any of the three existing
salary schedules as of December 31, 2014, shall receive $1,988 in 2016 by
adding this amount to the adjusted 2015 step, $2,028 in 2017 added to the
adjusted 2016 step and $2,069 in 2018 added to the adjusted 2017 step,

effective January 1 of each calendar year in 2016, 2017 and 2018. Each such

46
employee shall remain on his or her salary step that was occupied as of
December 31, 2014° throughout 2015, 2016, 2017 and 2018 and for future
purposes retain his or her anniversary date based upon date of hire pursuant to

Article III{A). Accordingly, the salary award is as follows:

1. Officer Pelligrino shall advance to the Year One Step in 2015
upen his advancement to that step upon completion of the
Police Academy.

2, In 2018, each step in each of the three salary schedules
shall be increased by $1,555 effective and retroactive to
January 1, 2015. In 2016, 2017 and 2018, each step of the
three salary schedules shall be increased by $1,988 in 2016,
$2,028 in 2017 and $2.069 in 2018. All current employees
who were employed on the December 31, 2014 scattergram
shall receive the increases.

3. Each unit employee shall remain on his or her step as of the
December 31, 2014 seattergram throughout the contract
duration, except for Officer Pelligrino who shall remain at the
Year One Step.

4, Any modification to staffing during this contract term shall
result in employees being placed on the appropriate salary
schedules as modified

Accordingly, and based upon all of the above, | respectfully enter the

terms of this Award.

 

AS stated, the one exception is Officer Pelligrino who shall remain on Step 1 after having been
moved from the Academy Step after six months.

Limsky Mitolo
This decision arises out of an impasse to be resolved by an interest
arbilration proceeding between the Franklin Lakes PBA Local 150 [the “PBA” or
“Union’] and the Borough of Franklin Lakes [the ‘Employer’ or “Borough”]. Prior
lo this proceeding, the parties conducted mediation sessions with a jointly
selected mediator but were unable to reach an agreement. On July 21, 2015, |
was randomly selected by the New Jersey Public Employment Relations
Commission ["PERC’] to serve as interest arbitrator in accordance with N.J.S.A,

34:13A-16e(1).

 

The legal requirements for this case are those set forth in N.

34:13A-16 through NuJ.S.A. 34:13A-16.9 as amended on June 24, 2014 by P.L.

 

2014, ¢ 11, These provisions took effect immediately and were retroactive to
April 2, 2014. The existing contract has a termination date of December 31,
2014. Because the petition was filed on June 18, 2015, PERC processed the

interest arbitration petition under the amended statute. N.J.S.A. 34:13A-16b(3)

 

Tequires that the arbitrator hold an initial meeting with the parties for the purpose
of conducting a mediation. That session was held on August 20, 2015. It was
determined that the impasse could not be resolved voluntarily at that time and

the matter then proceeded to formal interest arbitration.

Final offers from each party were received on September 4, 2015. A
formal interest arbitration hearing was held on September 11, 2015. An

additional attempt to mediate the impasse prior to the hearing was not
successful. The parties were aware that the flexibility to resolve the impasse
without having to be subject to the statutory salary cap would no longer be
present if the impasse proceeded to an award. At hearing, substantial
documentary evidence was submitted into the record on all aspects of the
statutory criteria, as well as on salary cap calculations. Post-hearing briefs were
due and filed on September 28, 2015. They were transmitted to each party on
that day. On October 14, 2015, the PBA filed a motion to strike certain exhibits
filed by the Borough with its post-hearing brief. On October 15, 2015, the
Borough filed a statement in opposition to the motion.’ Pursuant to P.L. 2014, ¢.
11, the arbitrator has 90 days from appointment, or by October 19, 2015, in

which to render an award.

In accordance with the statute, each party submitted a last and final offer.

These offers are as follows:

BACKGROUND

The municipality of the Borough of Franklin Lakes is located in Bergen
County in an area commonly defined geographically as Northwest Bergen. Other
municipalities considered to be included in northwest Bergen County are
Allendale, Gienlock, HoHoKus, Midland Park, Oakland, Saddle River, Ramsey,
Ridgewood, Waldwick and Wyckoff. The bargaining unit consists of patrol
officers and sergeants. In total there are eighteen (18) employees in the

bargaining unit but there were nineteen (19) as of December 31, 2014.

The existing collective negotiations agreement contains complex salary
schedules containing three tiers based upon date of hire. In addition, the “steps”
on the salary schedules in many instances are based upon a grouping of years of
service rather than on an annual basis. | refer to these types of groupings as
bands. Further, the parties, at a prior point of time, eliminated a longevity
Schedule and folded longevity payments into certain steps on the salary
schedule, This has resulted in an elongated salary schedule based upon the
number of years of service. The Agreement also provides that eligibility for
advancement to the next higher patroiman’s grade is based upon their
anniversary date of employment. An exception is for those who attain the rank of
Patroiman Year 18 who receive the appropriate negotiated salary on the first day
of January of each succeeding year. In addition, assignments to the Detective
Bureau/Juvenile Bureau and Traffic Bureau yield an increase of 1.5%. The

respective proposals of the parties reflect that the PBA seeks to maintain the
existing salary schedules while the Borough seeks to amend the step schedule to
add nine (9) steps to members hired between January 1, 1999 and March 27,

2012 and to add 8 steps for members hired on or after March 27, 2012.

The record reflects that the residents of the Borough employs a higher
than normal income. It has over 10,000 residents and its median household
income of $153,681 ranks thirteenth (13") in New Jersey. The Borough points
out that its budgeting process requires that it adhere to the 2% tax levy cap, as
well as the statutory cap on salary increases that can be awarded in arbitration
However, it does not assert that it has an inability to pay increases that fall within

the statutory limitations or that adverse financial impact would result from same.

The parties are in substantial dispute over the method upon which salary
increases can be calculated pursuant to the statutory cap on the amount that an
interest arbitrator can award under the amended statute. Their respective
positions on this will be evaluated during the analysis on the salary portion of this
award. In addition, the disputed issues are extensive, including the PBA's
proposal to reduce employee medical contributions, to increase the clothing
allowance and to provide that mandatory training be conducted on an overtime
rate basis. The parlies disagree on the term of the Agreement and also the
Borough's proposal to award increases in the number of steps to the existing
salary schedules, ta reduce the amount of clothing allowance, to reduce the

annual sick leave allowance, to replace the existing medical insurance plan with
a new plan, to limit retiree medical coverage for new hires until they reach 65
years of age and to require retirees to receive the same level of retiree benefits
as those provided to current employees effective December 31, 2019. Because
of the extremely limited period of time between receipt of post-hearing briefs and
the due date of an award, the issues must be decided without engaging in an
exhaustive summary of the parties’ arguments and evidence. Each issue will be
considered individually, followed by an award setting forth all of the issues

awarded representing changes to the existing collective negotiations agreement,

DISCUSSION

The statute requires the arbitrator to make a reasonable determination of
the disputed issues giving due weight to those factors set forth in NJS.A
34:13A-169(1) through (9) that are relevant to the resolution of the issues. These

factors, commonly called the statutory criteria, are as follows:

(1) The interests and welfare of the public. Among the items the
arbitrator or panel of arbitrators shall assess when
considering this factor are the limitations imposed upon the
employer by (P.L. 1976, c. 68 (C. 40A:4-45.1 et seq}.

(2) Comparison of the wages, salaries, hours, and conditions of
employment of the employees involved in the arbitration
proceedings with the wages, hours, and conditions of
employment of other employees performing the same or
similar services and with other employees generally:

(2) In private employment in general; provided,
however, each party shall have the right to
submit additional evidence for the arbitrator's
consideration.
3)

(4)

(8)

6)

{b) In public employment in general; provided,
however, each party shall have the right to
submit additional evidence for the arbitrator's
consideration.

(€) In public employment in the same or similar
comparable jurisdictions, as determined in
accordance with section 5 of P.L. 1995. c. 425
(C.34:13A-16.2) provided, however, each party
shall have the right to submit additional
evidence conceming the comparability of
jurisdictions for the arbitrator's consideration.

The overall compensation presently received by the
employees, inclusive of direct wages, salary, vacations,
holidays, excused leaves, insurance and pensions, medical
and hospitalization benefits, and all other economic benefits
received.

Stipulations of the parties.

The lawful authority of the employer. Among the items the
arbitrator or panel of arbitrators shall assess when
considering this factor are the limitations imposed upon the
employer by the P.L. 1976 c. 68 (C.40A:4-45 et sea )

The financial impact on the governing unit, its residents and
taxpayers. When considering this factor in a dispute in
which the public employer is a county or a municipality, the
arbitrator or panel of arbitrators shall take into account to the
extent that evidence is introduced, how the award will affect
the municipal or county purposes element, as the case may
be, of the local property tax; a comparison of the percentage
of the municipal purposes element, or in the case of a
county, the county purposes element, required to fund the
employees’ contract in the preceding local budget year with
that required under the award for the current local budget
year, the impact of the award for each income sector of the
property taxpayers on the local unit; the Impact of the award
on the ability of the governing body to (a) maintain existing
local programs and services, (b) expand existing local
programs and services for which public moneys have been
designated by the governing body in a proposed local
budget, or (c) initiate any new programs and services for
which public moneys have been designated by the
governing body in its proposed local budget.
(7) The cost of living.

(8) The continuity and stability of employment including seniority
tights and such other factors not confined te the foregoing
which are ordinarily or traditionally considered in the
determination of wages, hours and conditions of employment
through collective negotiations and collective bargaining
between the parties in the public service and in private
employment.

(8) Statutory restrictions imposed on the employer. Among the

items the arbitrator or panel of arbitrators shall assess when
considering this factor are the limitations imposed upon the
employer by section 10 of P.L. 2007, c. 62 (C.40A:4-45.45).

My review of the criteria must be accomplished based upon the evidence
presented as well as the application of well established standards in collective
negotiations and interest arbitration. The party seeking to modify existing terms
and conditions of employment has a burden to prove that there is basis for its
Proposed change. The burden to be met must be at a level beyond a party
seeking additional benefits or concessions to existing terms and conditions of
employment without sufficient evidentiary support. No proposed issue by either
party will be deemed to be presumptively valid in the absence of justification that
is supported by credible evidence. | also observe that a proposal may not be
viewed in isolation to all other proposals. Any decision to award or deny any
individual issue in dispute will include consideration as to the reasonableness of
that individual issue in relation to the terms of the entire award. In other words,
there may be merit to awarding or denying a single issue if it were to stand alone,

but a different conclusion may be reached after assessing its merits within the

context of all of the changes that are included in the overall award.
DURATION

The PBA proposes a three year agreement, effective January 1, 2015
through December 31, 2017, The Borough proposes a five year agreement,
effective January 1, 2015 through December 31, 2019. Almost a full year has
passed since contract expiration. Regardless of the contract duration awarded.
the parties are subject to the statutory salary cap on the amount of salary that
can be awarded. In addition, the record reflects stability in the Borough's
finances and a continuity and stability of employment that serve as a proper

basis for a contract duration of January 1, 2015 through December 31, 2018.

ARTICLE IX - CLOTHING ALLOWANCE

 

Both parties have proposals to change the amount of clothing allowance
currently paid under Article IX(8). The existing benefit provides

Each Police Officer shall receive an annual clothing allowance.

‘The amount of clothing allowance is $650.00. Said amount shall be

paid in a lump sum amount on the first day in January, provided

that a newly hired officer shall not be entitled t0 such allowance

during the same year that he has been provided with an initial issue

of clothing and equipment in accordance with Paragraph A above.

The Borough proposes to reduce the allowance to $150, effective January
1, 2016. It submits:

Officers currently receive a $650 annual clothing allowance plus a
$360 annual uniform maintenance allowance, or a total clothing

44
allowance benefit of $1,000 per year. Assuming that this decrease
is effective on January 1, 2016, the clothing allowance decrease
will save the Borough $850 per officer times nineteen (19) officers
or $16,150 per year. As a percentage of 2014 total base salaries,
this proposal will reduce the Borough's costs by 0.87%
($16, 150/$1,852,333 x 100) in 2016. The savings will continue in
2017, 2018 and 2019 and beyond.

The PBA proposes to increase the clothing allowance by $250 annually

and urges rejection of the Borough's proposal, It argues:

The PBA proposes an increase to the clothing allowance. The
amount of the clothing allowance has been stagnant over the past
several years. An adjustment for the increase in the cost of living is
appropriate in this case by way of an increase to the clothing
allowance. The members of the PBA have been subjected to
increased payments over the last five years including healthcare
contributions, increased pension contributions, higher healthcare
costs, among others.

There is a [Borough] proposal to reduce the clothing allowance
from $650 annually to $150 annually. While this will save the
employer a few dollars the impact will be larger on the individual
members. Over a three year contract each employee will lose
$1500. This would negate any increase for the members at top pay
and significantly reduce step increases for the lowest paid
members. The employer cannot provide any basis for such a
drastic reduction. In fact, the employer's own chart shows that the
PBA is gets less than the average of the ather towns cited by the
employer. As the PBA proposal requests, the amount for the
clothing allowance should be increased just based upon the
increased cost of living. Cost for purchasing uniforms increases
each year, it does not go down. Taking the huge chunk out of the
clothing allowance that the employer is seeking does nothing more
than further harm the members

Award

After review of the parties’ proposals, | do not find merit to any alteration of

the status quo. The existing level of clothing allowance is reasonable based

12
upon all relevant comparisons and no persuasive justification has been offered
by either party for an increase or decrease in the existing level of benefit.

Accordingly, both proposals are denied

GRIEVANCE SETTLEMENT

The parties have a pending unresolved grievance concerning prescription
co-pays for retirees. The Borough proposes that a settlement of the grievance

be awarded. Its proposal is as follows:

The Borough proposes to resolve a grievance arbitration over
prescription co-pays. The grievance arbitration is pending before
Arbitrator Martin Scheinman, the parties have agreed to stay the
grievance arbitration pending the conclusion of this interest
arbitration matter. Like SHBP, the Borough implemented higher
prescription co-pays for its retirees than its active employees. The
PBA filed a grievance, asserting that the Borough violated the
requirement that it provide "the same level of such benefits
received at the time of retirement” to its retirees. In other words,
the PBA asserted that the retirees should pay the same prescription
co-pays in effect at the fime they retired. The Borough proposes to
resolve the grievance by amending coverage for existing retirees
prospectively, effective as of the date of the award, to provide co-
insurance at the same level as provided on the date of retirement.
The Borough, however, declines to provide co-insurance at the
same level a8 provided on date of retirement for claims based on
coverage prior to the date of the award

The PBA seeks rejection of the Borough's proposal:

The employer has included the settlement of a grievance in its final
proposal that is currently pending grievance arbitration. The parties
had agreed to put off the hearing while they were attempting to
reach a settlement on the contract. However, now that this matter
has proceeded to arbitration, there is no authority for this matter to
be resolved in an interest arbitration award. This is especially so
since there is no evidence in the record regarding the underlying
dispute. This proposal should be denied on its face.

Award

| decline to award the Borough's proposal. This matter arose under the
prior labor agreement and is a matter of contract interpretation before an
arbitrator who has been appointed under the parties’ selection procedure. An
imposition of settlement terms would infringe on the PBA’s right to a
determination on the grievance it filed in accordance with the contractual

grievance procedure

ARTICLE X

 

ICK LEAVE

 

Article X sets forth a comprehensive scheme for sick leave. The Borough
proposes to reduce the number of annual sick days from twelve (12) sick days to

ten (10) sick days per year effective January 1, 2016. {t asserts:

Currently, all officers receive twelve (12) sick days per year
Employees who do not use all of their accrued sick time are entitled
to one-half a day's pay for each unused sick day per calendar year.
Although the savings cannot be calculated with certainty, the
reduction of sick time from twelve (12) sick days to ten (10) sick
days per year results in a savings to the Borough of about one (1)
day's pay for each officer. In accordance with traditional labor
principals, one day of pay equals about 0.33%, As a result, the
Borough will attribute a 0.33% savings to this proposal in 2016

The PBA submits that there is no basis or evidentiary support to award the

Borough's proposal. It argues:

4
There is no evidence in the record of sick time abuse. Twelve sick
days per year can hardly be said to be excessive. While there may
be some municipalities with ten sick days, there are probably twice
as many that have fifteen sick days. For example, the agreement
between Glen Rock and the PBA (U-18) provides for twenty sick
days annually, Paramus and Ridgewood provide for fifteen days
per year. (U-20; U-22), There is no basis for a reduction in sick
days in this case.

Award

Beyond the Borough's attribution of approximately 0.33% in savings that it
would receive if its proposal were awarded, there is insufficient evidence to
support this concessionary proposal. The number of sick days received is not
beyond the norm, and there is no data reflecting that there has been an

excessive use of sick leave. Accordingly, the Borough's proposal is denied

ARTICLE XvVill - ATTENDANCE AT TRAINING COURSES

 

The parties have negotiated a provision governing compensation for

required attendance at in-service training courses. It states:

In the event the Chief of Police shall require any officer or
patrolman to attend a specific in-service training course for the
development of a skill not otherwise available to the Police
Department through any of its members, such officer or patrolman
shall receive compensation at a pro-rated hourly rate based upon
the appropriate salary schedule or compensatory time off equal to
the time spent in attendance at the training course, with a minimum
of 3 hours. The method of compensation shall be determined by
the Chief of Police. Nothing contained herein shall be construed as
to permit to any officer or patrolman for attendance at an in-service
course which is not specifically required to be taken as required
above.
The PBA seeks to modify the compensation component of Article XVIII to

require that its members receive their overtime rate for training.

The Borough urges denial of the PBA's proposal. It submits the following

statement in opposition:

The PBA proposes that members receive theit overtime rate for
training. Article XVIll, Attendance at Training Courses, provides
that officers receive compensation at a pro-rated hourly rate or
compensatory time off equal to the time spent in attendance at the
training course, subject to a minimum of three (3) hours for training
The Chief presently determines the method of compensation. The
PBA’s proposal will result in increased costs during the contract
term, but these costs are too speculative to calculate because the
Borough does not know the number of hours its police officers will
spend attending training during the successor contract term.

The 2010 Amendments also bar an award of the PBA’s training
compensation proposal. N.J.S.A. § 34:13A-16.7(b) precludes the
arbitrator from rendering an award that includes non-salary
economic issues which were not included in the predecessor
agreement. Because the PBA’s training compensation proposal
has economic ramifications, it constitutes a “non-salary economic
issue” within the meaning of the 2010 Amendments. The 2010
Amendments therefore preclude an award of he PBA's training
compensation proposal

Award

| need not address the Borough's argument that N.J.S.A. § 34:13A-16.7(b)
precludes the awarding of this non-salary economic issue. The PBA has not
sustained its burden of establishing sufficient merit upon which to award the

proposal to require overtime for required training. The existing provision appears

16
to have been negotiated with proper balance given to the competing interests
involved, including the requirement that a minimum of three hours be paid for any

participation in required training. Accordingly, the PBA’s proposal is denied

PRIVATE DUTY RATE

 

The Agreement does not specify the amount of payment to be received by
an officer for off-duty or private duty authorized work to be performed. The
Borough has proposed to increase the private duty rate from $70 to $86 per hour

and has already imptemented its proposal. It notes that:

Because the Borough is compensated by the outside contractor for
private duty costs, this proposal does not increase the Borough's
costs. The increase in the private duty rate, however, is a
substantial benefit for PBA members.

The PBA observes:

The employer passed an ordinance making the change and the
PBA did not oppose it. It was not part of the negotiations process.
Even if the employer argues that it was part of negotiations, it must
be determined that the increase was stipulated between the parties
as it has already gone into effect. If the employer were to
unilaterally lower this rate it would be subject to challenge by the
PBA. The PBA has no issue with the arbitrator finding this point
moot or stipulated between the parties.

Award

Given the parties’ mutual acknowledgement that there is no dispute as to

the increase in the private duty rate, | will award the Borough's proposal in a
fashion similar to having received a stipulation as authorized by NUS.A. §

34:43A-169(4).

HEALTH INSURANCE

Both parties have advanced proposals that deal with health insurance:

They will be reviewed individually.

Health Insurance Employee Contributions
(PBA Proposal)

 

Arlicle VII(B) obligates employees to contribute towards payment of
medical prescription and dental insurance in accordance with the provisions of
state law, The PBA has proposed to reduce employee contributions for medical
insurance by 50% commencing January 1, 2016. It supports its proposal as

follows:

The PBA proposes a fifty percent (50%) reduction in the medical
contributions that members make to their healthcare starting in
2016. All of the members of the PBA are contributing the full
amount of the medical care contribution as stated in Chapter 78,
Chapter 78 states:

‘Once those employees are subjected to the contribution
requirements set forth in subsection a. of this section,
the public employers and public employees shall be
bound by this act . . . to apply the contribution levels set
forth in section 39 of this act until all affected employees
are contributing the full amount of the contribution, as
determined by the implementation schedule set forth in
subsection a. of this section. Notwithstanding the
expiration date set forth in section 83 of this act . . . or
the expiration of any successor agreements, parties

18
shali_be bound to apply the requirements of this
paragraph _until_they have reached the full
implementation of the schedule set forth _in

Subsection a. of this section.

 

Specifically, N.J-S.A. 40A:10-21.2 states:

After full implementation, those contribution levels shall
become part of the parties’ collective negotiations and
shall then be subject to collective negotiations in a
manner similar to other negotiable items between the
parties.

Section 83 of Chapter 78, P.L. 2011 states:

This act shall take effect immediately, and sections 39

through 44, inclusive, shall expire four years after the
effective date

The effective date of the statute, N.J.S.A, 40A:10-21.2 was June
28, 2011. It is now expired. The contribution amounts are
negotiable. While there is a cap on salary increases, there is no
reason why an adjustment cannot be made to the healthcare
contribution in order to balance out the financial impact of the two
percent cap. As a result of the salary cap the members will not be
receiving their full step increases and those at the top step will be
getting a very small increase. A reduction in the contribution would
at least allow the members to have more money at their disposal,
although not part of salary with all of the benefits associated with
that.

As a result of the salary cap combined with the health care
contributions, the officers, especially those at top pay, have seen a
reduction in actual money they take home. Officers at top pay may
not get a raise over the course of a contract, yet they have been
paying approximately $10,000 for a family plan. The contribution is
negotiable and it is appropriate to make an adjusiment to the
contribution levels in this case. The parties jointly developed a
salary guide which led to a couple bubble steps which have the
result of using up most of the available money for any monetary
raise. This was not just the fault of the PBA, yet the PBA members
bear the brunt of its harsh results. There is no doubt that at some
point in the past, the employer benefitted from pushing off raises
which led to the bubble steps. Now, is attempting to get another
benefit by essentially blaming the large increases in those bubble
steps on the PBA. The employer wants a new salary scale forever
delaying the contractual salaries while maintaining the inordinately
high medical contribution levels.

While it is understood that the PBA can only propose salary
adjustments in accordance with the cap statute, it is within the
Powers of the arbitrator to adjust the medical contribution. Such an
adjustment would be an equitable adjustment to the stagnant
salaries and regressive legislation which the members of the PBA
have been subject to for the past several years.

The medical contribution is an ever rising cost to both the PBA
members and the employer. However, the PBA members have no
means to obtain more money to pay for their contribution other than
money available through negotiations and arbitration The
employer, on the other hand, can obtain more money, if necessary.

The Borough objects to the PBA’s proposal and submits that the proposal
the PBA has presented is pre-empted by law. It offers the following arguments in

support of its position:

Because the PBA’s collective bargaining agreement expired on
December 31, 2011, after Chapter 78 took effect, the contribution,
subject to a 4-year phase in at 25% per year, took effect in January
2012. Employees contributed at first year percentages in 2012,
second year percentages in 2013, and third year percentages in
2014, Employees contribute at fourth year percentages in 2015,
the first year of the successor contract determined by this interest
arbitration,

The Interest Arbitrator cannot implement the PBA’s health
insurance proposal to reduce employee contributions by 50%
effective January 1, 2016 because the PBA's proposal is
preempted by N.J.S.A. § 40A:10-21.2; the PBA cannot negotiate a
change in employee contribution amounts until the contract after full
implementation of the fourth year. NJSA. § 40A:10-212
provides, in relevant part,

A_public_employer_and_employees who _are_in
negotiations forthe next collective negotiation
agreement to be executed after the employees in that
unit have reached full implementation of the premium
share set forth in section 39 of PL. 2011, c. 78
(G.52:14-17.28c) shall conduct negotiations conceming

 

 

 

20
contributions for health care benefits as if the full
Premium share was included in the prior contract.
After full implementation, those contribution levels shail
become part of the parties’ collective negotiations and
shalt then be subject to collective negotiations in a
manner similar fo other negotiable items between the
parties.

Id. (emphasis added). Negotiations conceming contribution to
premiums therefore cannot occur until the collective negotiations
agreement after full implementation.

Local Finance Notice 2011-20R supports this interpretation. It
provides,

The law provides directive language that affects the
negotiations of CNA’s after full implementation of health
benefits contribution. . Once the fourth year has
been completed (100% of the required contribution has
been paid for a year), the law provides that:

2. Negotiations for the next contract shall be
conducted as if the full contribution was part of the
previous contract.
¢._ Once... [there is] full implementation, the
contribution structure is negotiable, starting from the
point of full implementation

Exhibit 7 at 11-12. Therefore, the Local Finance Notice provides
further support that the law bars negotiation of a reduction in
contribution to premiums until the collective bargaining agreement
after full implementation of four years of contributions.

Moreover, in Clementon Board of Education and Clementon
Education Associati P.E.R.C. No, 2016-10, 42 NJPER ___ (fl

2015), attached as Exhibit 8, PERC held that a proposal
made in negotiations for a successor collective bargaining
agreement to reduce empioyee health insurance premium
contributions was preempted by NJS.A § 18A:16-17.2. This
statutory section contains identical language to N.JS.A. § 40A:10-
21.2, the statute applicable to municipal police officers, among
other public employees.

 

 

In Clementon, the parties had a three year collective bargaining
agreement with a term from July 1, 2011 through June 30, 2044

2i
Chapter 78 became effective on June 28, 2011. Unit employees
began their required four years of contributions upon the expiration
of the predecessor contract at the first level on July 1, 2011. On
July 1, 2014, the first year of the successor collective bargaining
agreement under negotiations, the employees began their fourth
year of contributions. The union proposed that employee
contribution to premiums should be reduced to 1.5% of base salary
after full implementation of Chapter 78. In quoting NUSA §
18A:16-17.2, which contains identical language to NJSA §
40A:10-21.2, the statute applicable to municipal police officers,
PERC held that the health insurance reduction proposal was
preempted until negotiations for the agreement that followed full
implementation. The parties could, therefore, negotiate regarding a
reduction in health insurance contributions in the next contract
negotiations. See Exhibit 8. As in Clementon, the parties are in
negotiations with one year remaining to achieve full implementation
of Chapter 78. This fourth year will occur under the successor
agreement presently under negotiations. Therefore, N.JS.A. §
40A:10-21.2 preempts negotiation of a reduction of premium
contribution rates until after full implementation of Chapter 78; Le.,
upon the expiration of the successor contract, depending on the
duration of the successor contract awarded. The Interest Arbitrator
should therefore decline to award the PBA's proposal to reduce
employee health insurance contributions by 50% effective January
1, 2016.

Award

The PBA forcefully argues that the legisiative imposition of health
insurance contributions is “regressive” and that relief is necessary through
Negotiated reductions in contribution levels. The statute preempts negotiations
but provides language that lifts the preemption in favor of negotiations with the
statutory levels serving as the status quo. The parties dispute the point in time in

which the issue will become negotiable.

22
Nu.

 

. § 34:13A-16g(5) requires the arbitrator to apply the lawful

 

authority of the employer and N.JS.A. § 34:134-16g(9) requires application of
statutory restrictions on the employer. Given this, | am required to adhere to the
statute and existing case law that governs when the issue of health insurance
contributions becomes negotiable. The Borough’s contention is persuasive that,
given the relevant facts of this case, the PERC decision in Clementon Board of

Education and Clementon Education Asscciation, P.E.R.C. No. 2016-10, 42

 

NJPER __ (ff 2015), governs this issue and, therefore, the PBA's
proposal is preempted by law and cannot be awarded. Accordingly, the proposal

is denied.

Health Insurance Plans
(Borough Proposal)

Article VIIA) obligates the Borough to provide medical and hospitalization
coverage in accordance with the “BMED" (Bergen Municipal Employees Benefit
Fund). It propases to switch this coverage to the Aetna PPO 20/35 Plan. It

offers the following explanation in support of its proposal

The Borough proposes to amend Article Xill, Medical, Dental and
Life Insurance with respect to health insurance benefits for active
employees and for retirees. Specifically, for active employees, the
Borough wants to provide that BMED 20/35 Plan will be the highest
cost plan offered effective on January 1, 2016. The Borough does
not provide health insurance through the State Health Benefits Plan
(SHBP"). Instead, the Borough participates in the Bergen
Municipal Employees Benefit Fund (‘BMED"), a Health insurance
Fund (HIF"). The plans. they offer are designed to “match” the
plans offered under SHBP, giving rise to the plan names.
Presently, the Borough provides employees and their dependents

23
with a choice of nine plans. All PBA members who have not
waived medical insurance coverage selected medical and
hospitalization coverage under the BMED Direct 10 Match Plan, the
highest cost plan the Borough offers. To contain the spiraling costs
of health insurance, the Borough proposes to offer the Aetna PPO
20/35 Plan as its highest cost plan. In 2016, using an estimated
increase in insurance premiums, the Borough would save about
$29,447 from the plan change. See Cost Comparison, Direct 10
Match vs. Aetna PPO 20/35 Plan at E-1, Section 5. This
represents a savings of 1.58% ($29,447/$1,852,333 x 100) in 2016.
Using estimates based on an 8% annual increase in premium costs
and assuming no changes in selected plan coverage (ie., single,
family, etc.) the Borough would save $132,691 over the remaining
four years of the contract. See E-1, Section 5. Employees would
save $37,426 over the remaining four years of the contract term in
premium contributions. See E-1, Section 5. Because cost savings
are speculative, the Borough cannot definitively calculate the
savings this proposal would bring to the Borough.

The PBA objects to the Borough's proposal. It argues:

The change proposed by the employer for medical coverage has
been somewhat addressed above. It is clear from the submissions
that the employer is solely concemed with keeping the premiums
down in anticipation of the Cadillac Tax. As stated above, a three
year contract will give the parties the opportunity to negotiate over
health care benefits when it is better known if this tax is going to go
into effect. A change to the BMED 20/35 plan is not warranted and
not supported by the evidence. The employer has only provided
the fact that the plan is cheaper. Cheaper does not, on its face,
establish that the plan is equal to the benefits currently in effect
Without a thorough and detailed presentation on the intricacies of
the plan, there is no way to measure the financial effect of changing
plans. While the premiums may be lower, there most certainly will
be other increased costs which allowed the premium to be lowered.
Co-pay costs, deductisle amounts, out-of-network casts etc., must
all be considered when evaluating a health care plan. The mere
assertion that the premiums are less does not suffice to make a
drastic change to the benefits.

24
Award

The Borough has presented a proposal supported by the cost savings to
be achieved. The amounts stated in the Borough's arguments are consistent
with representations made at hearing. It points out that employees would also
save due to decreased premium costs upon which their contribution levels are
based. These savings are actual in contrast with speculative savings that could
arise from the projected imposition of the “Cadillac tax." Although the PBA
alleges an absence of evidence as to the detailed nature of plan design change,
the record does not support this argument. The proposed plan has, without
objection, been presented as one that provides comprehensive health care
coverage that patterns the New Jersey State Health Benefits Plan. The interests
and welfare of the public are not furthered by the Borough having to continue to
bear the burdensome costs of health care coverage under the existing plan

Accordingly, | award the Borough's proposal.

Retiree Health Benefits
(Borough Proposals)

The Agreement, at Article VIII(D) provides for retiree health insurance. It

states:

For employees who retire after twenty (20) years of service to the
Borough and twenty-five (25) years in the pension system, the
Borough will provide full (100%) medical insurance, dental,
prescription, and family or spousal coverage, at the same level of
such benefits received at the time of retirement. Insurance
coverage for fully relied (25 years of service) employees, as

26
authorized herein, is secondary to any coverage or benefits
available or which may become available from Medicare or any
other sources of insurance, governmental or — otherwise.
Additionally, such coverage as may be provided by the Borough,
will be discontinued for any period when insurance coverage is
obtained as a result of other employment, but will be reinstated
upon the termination of such employment.

The Borough seeks to modify the above provision as follows:

The Borough proposes two modifications to retiree health benefits.
First, the Borough proposes, effective on the date of the award,
new hires receive medical coverage from their retirement until they
reach age 65. Presently, officers receive medical coverage upon
their retirement for life, secondary to any coverage which becomes
available from Medicare or any other source. An award of this
proposal will result in significant savings to the Borough, but those
savings are too speculative to calculate.

Second, the Borough proposes to amend the contract language in
Paragraph D to provide that employees retiing on or after
December 31, 2019 will receive the same level of benefits as
provided to then-current employees. Presently, Paragraph D
provides, “For employees who retire after twenty (20) years of
service to the Borough and twenty-five years in the pension system,
the Borough will provide full (100%) medical insurance, dental,
prescription, and family or spousal coverage, at the same level of
such benefits received at the time of retirement.” (emphasis added)
The PBA interprets this language to mean that the Borough must
provide an employee who, by way of example, retired in 1985 with
the same health insurance benefits today as the employee received
in 1985 at the time he retired. The Borough finds this obligation
unworkable given the realities of today’s medical insurance market.
Not only is the level of benefits provided years ago cost prohibitive,
but plans providing such benefits may no longer exist. The
Borough's proposal will enable retirees to receive health insurance
benefits in tune with today’s insurance market by tying the level of
benefits provided to retirees to the level of benefits provided to
then-current employees. An award of this proposal will result in
significant savings to the Borough, but those savings are too
speculative to calculate.

‘The PBA objects to the Borough's proposals. It submits:

26
The employer is seeking to amend the contract to limit retiree
benefits for those members retiring afle: December 31, 2019 to the
level of benefits provided to current employees. Again, there has
been no evidence submitted in support of such a drastic change to
benefits. Health benefits are extremely valuable. There is no way
to tell what the future will bring with regard to these benefits. When
discussing retiree benefits we are discussing health care twenty or
thirty years from now. That would be completely unpredictable. In
the future employees may give up employer health care for some
other benefit. Where would that leave retirees? With no benefits?
Such an open ended, speculative proposal must be denied. .

This is also true for the proposal to end medical coverage at sixty-
five for new hires. There is still a cost associated with health care
after sixty-five. Members will have to purchase additional health
care plans such as Medicare Part B, to get complete coverage.
The employer is simply trying to ‘ay that cost off on the employee
without any basis for doing so.

Award

1 do not award either aspect of the Borough's proposals. Retiree health
insurance is an issue that can be revisited without prejudice to the Borough in
future negotiations after presenting a detailed review of the costs associated with
having to provide individual retiree health benefit plans for all retirees who are
subject to health insurance coverage. t is noted that the Borough’s proposal, if
awarded, would not be effective until December 31, 2019. Thus, the December
31, 2018 contract duration awarded permits sufficient time for the renewal of

negotiations on this issue.

SALARY

The Borough and the PBA have widely divergent positions on salary.
These include the amount of salary that can be awarded under the statutory cap,
the proper method for calculating those amounts and the structure of the salary

schedules to be awarded.

The first point of analysis is the structure of the existing salary schedules.
They are divided into three (8) separate schedules depending upon date of hire.

They are as follows, as set forth in Appendix A — Wages of the Agreement:

In order to place the parties’ proposals in their proper perspective, certain
observations are required to be made. First, each of the three salary schedules
covers two classes of officers, Patrolman and Sergeants. Second, each of the
Schedules provides for a salary or a step at a distinct year or years of experience
level, such as “Year 8.” It also includes bands based upon years of experience
level, such as “Years 20-24.” The two schedules involving employees hired on or
after March 28, 2012 and employees hired between January 1, 1999 and March
27, 2012 each have a Police Academy Basic Training step at $41,752 and a
Year One step of $51,804. The Year One step follows the six months that a

trainee successfully serves the Police Academy.

‘The salary steps, including the single salary steps and the salary bands,
suggest that an employee would advance to the next step upon achieving the
years of experience required to advance. However, in the prior contract, officers
moved only two steps in three years. Thus, as the PBA points out, “Year 8”

really was “Year 9.” Article Ill{A) provides language describing this structure and

30
modification to prior practice in the priot agreement, including temporary changes

in anniversary dates that normally would trigger step movement:

Except as follows, patrolmen shall become eligible for
advancement to the next higher patrolman's grade at their
anniversary date of employment as an officer with the Borough of
Franklin Lakes, During the life of this contract only, step movement
below Year 8 shail be every 18 months. For example, an employee
‘on step for Year 2 with a current anniversary date of October 15”
shall receive his next increment on April 15, 2013. The next
subsequent increment shall be on October 15, 2014, returning the
employee to the original anniversary date. Upon the 2014 return to
the original anniversary date, the next subsequent increment shall
return to the twelve months interval. Upon attaining the rank of
Patrolman year 18, an officer shall be entitled to the appropriate
negotiated salary for that year, on the first day of January of each
succeeding year.

An additional factor that provides some complexity to the existing salary
schedules is the fact that in the past the parties negotiated and included a
longevity provision into the Agreement that was separate and distinct from the
salary schedules. In the last Agreement, the parties voluntarily negotiated a
process that commonly referred to as a fold-in of longevity payments into the
steps of the salary schedule. It is for this reason that the salary guides in
Appendix A provide for steps and bands that exceed the level of twenty years of
experience, including steps defined as “Years 25+” and “Years 28+" and bands
such as “Years 23-27." The Borough explains this transition in its post-hearing
submission:

The salary guides in the collective bargaining agreement that

expired on December 31, 2014 require explanation. See J-1 at 14-

16. Franklin Lakes appears to have a lot of steps on its salary
guide because lhe salary guides preserved the once separate

3
longevity steps and incorporated them into the salary guide. The
sixteen (16) step guide for patrol officers hired after January 1,
1999 but on or before March 27, 2012, and the nineteen (19) step
guide for patrol officers hired on or after March 28, 2012 resulted
from the direct folding in of longevity benefits into base salary. The
steps in the salary guide that reflect folded in longevity benefits
provide significantly smaller increases than the steps that reflect
original step increases. With respect to sergeants and patrol
officers hired prior to January 1, 1999, all steps on the salary guide
reflect former longevity increases, For sergeants and patrol officers
hired between January 1, 1999 and March 27, 2012, all steps
above Year 8 reflect former longevity increases. Police Academy
Basic Training through Year 8 are true step increases, with officers
reaching maximum step at Year 8, after the completion of seven
years of service. The salary guide therefore has nine (8) steps
{Inclusive of two steps during the first year). For sergeants and
patrol officers hired on or after March 28, 2012, all steps above
Year 11 reflect former longevity increases. Police Academy Basic
Training through Year 11 are true step increases. Officers reach
maximum step after the completion of ten (10) years of service
The salary guide therefore has twelve (12) steps (inclusive of two
steps during the first year). See J-1 at 14-16.

The overview above is essential to understanding the rationale for the
parties’ respective final offers on salary and, to some extent, the basis for their
disagreements on future salary structure, including the number of steps and the
calculation of salary expenditures. Significantly, despite challenging each others’
method of calculation under the statutory salary cap, they have stipulated to the
first necessary step required for such calculation under the statute and applicable
case law. That is, that the 2014 expenditures by the Borough on 2014 base
salaries was $1,852,333 and that the cap amount of 2% that can be allotted
towards salary increases amounted to $37,047 in 2015. It is noted that that
amount is now allowed to be compounded annually so the total amount for a four

year agreement, by way of example, is $37,047, $37,789, $38,543 and $39,315

32
or a total of $152,684. The statute also authorizes the arbitrator to apportion
yearly amounts in a manner that equals this sum but permits its distribution in

varying annual amounts.

The extent to which the parties have disagreement over salaries despite
their concurrence on the applicability of the statutory salary cap, the gross
amounts paid out in salary for 2014 and the amounts that equate to 2%, is
evident in three major respects. The first disagreement is what the number of
steps should be on the new salary guides. The PBA proposes no change in the
number of steps. It instead focuses on the amounts of salary that it believes
each officer should be individually awarded in order to stay within the 2% cap. In
contrast, the Borough proposes to add nine steps to the salary guide for
members hired between January 1, 1999 and March 27, 2012 and to add eight
steps to the salary guide for members hired on or after March 28, 2012. The
added steps are said to be necessary in order to advance an officer to a higher

‘step but to render that step smaller in order to stay within the cap.

The second disagreement is over what individual officer salaries or
amounts should be included or excluded from salary cap calculations. By way of
example, there are sharp disagreements over salary calculations that concem
two police officers. These officers are Patrolman Pelligrino and former Patrolman
Albert. The parties have addressed these disputes in their written post-hearing

submissions. The PBA argues the following

33
With regard to the calculations on either the PBA proposed salary
guide or the employer's propused guide, there are fundamental
disagreements. The first disagreement is with Officer Pelligrino.
The employer has included him in their calculations for the two
percent cap and, more importantly, against the cap for his
movement through the salary guide. On December 31, 2014
Officer Pelligrino was in the police academy. He was not a police
officer or patrolman, nor was he a member of the PBA until after he
graduated the academy. While it is true that there was a salary
step for the Academy, he was not covered under the collective
bargaining agreement until after he had graduated the Academy.
Article |, Covered Personnel, states:

This Agreement shall apply to all full time Officers and
Patralmen of the Department employed by the Borough,
and the exception of the ranks of Chief, Captain, and
Lieutenant.

NJ.S.A. 34:13A4-16.7 states in relevant part:

b. An arbitrator shall not render any award pursuant to
section 3 of P.L.1977, c. 85(C.34:13A-16) which, in the
first year of the collective negotiation agreement
awarded by the arbitrator, increases base salary items
by more than 2.0 percent of the aggregate amount
expended by the public employer on base salary items
for_the members of the affected employee
organization _in_the twelve months immediately
preceding the expiration of the collective
negotiation agreement subject fo arbitration.

 

 

 

 

There is no question that Pellegrino was not a “member of the
affected employee organization” on December 31, 2014
Additionally, on the effective date of the new agreement, January 1,
2015, he was not a police officer, patrolman, or member of the
PBA, Finally, Pellegrino was treated differently than all of the
members of the PBA. When he was finally swom in as a police
officer and became a member of the bargaining unit, he was placed
on the first step of the salary guide. It was also at that time, April 4,
2016, that he was enrolled in the Police and Firemen’s Retirement
System (‘PFRS"). (U-25). Alll police officers are required to be
enrolled in the PFRS. Pellegrino was not, under the law, permitted
to be enrolled in the PFRS because he was not a police officer until
he completed the Academy. If he was a member of the bargaining
unit why did the employer change his salary. yet freeze everyone
else? The answer is simple. When he was sworn in as a police

34
officer, the Borough had to put him at the starting salary for police
officers. Pellegrino’s salary increases should not be part of the
money available under the wu percent salary cap.

The second issue concems the status of Officer Albert who has left
the police department and is no longer employed by the Borough.
Albert onfy worked for a few months in the beginning of 2015 and
then left to go work for another department. It is acknowledged that
the Commission has addressed this Issue, however, the facts of
this case are different from the cases addressed by PERC
previously, In Borough of New Milford and PBA Local 83, 38
NJPER 91116 (2012), the Commission wrote

 

Since an arbitrator, under the new law, is required to
project costs for the entirety of the duration of the award,
caleviation of purported savings resulting from
anticipated retirements, and for that matter added costs
due to replacement by hiring new staff or promoting
existing staff are all too speculative to be calculated at
the time of the award. The Commission believes that the
better model to achieve compliance with P.L. 2010 o
105 is to utilize the scattergram demonstrating the
placement on the guide of all of the employees in the
bargaining unit as of the end of the year preceding the
initiation of the new cantract, and to simply move those
employees forward through the newly awarded salary
scales and longevity entitiements.

In this case, Albert leaving the department is not speculative. It has
already occurred. He is no longer an employee of the Borough.
The arbitrator is mandated to project costs for the duration of the
award. Using a salary for a person who is not an employee does
not further that mandate. In fact, it would automatically create a
false projection. It would add approximately $180,600 of spending
that does not exist. In a relatively small unit, like this one, that
would completely change the projected costs. Finally, since the
PBA's proposal is done by providing salaries for the individual
officers, if it is necessary to put Albert on the list of officers, the PBA
proposes he gets no increases for the duration of the contract.

The Borough disagrees with the PBA’s method of calculation cancering

Officers Pelligrino and Albert and contends that its own methad of calculation is

35
more consistent with the statute and the PERC case law in regard to the proper

methad of calculation. The Borough submits:

The PBA does not calculate the cost of its demands in accordance
with applicable law. First, the PBA’s calculations are flawed
because the PBA failed to include Officer Albert's salary costs in
the successor contract term. See Exhibit 2. Officer Albert resigned
on July 13, 2015, six and one-half months into the successor
contract term. In accordance with New Milford, 38 NJPER at 340
and Borough of Ramsey, 39 NJPER 17, discussed above, which
directs that separations, retirements, and promotions that occur
during the successor contract term do not affect calculations,
Officer Albert's salary costs must be carried through the successor
contract term as if he remained employed. The PBA's decision to
omit Officer Albert's salary costs illegally frees up $51,804 for
salary increases for other officers.

Moreover, as discussed above, the PBA erred in failing to include
Officer Pellegrino in its calculations. See Exhibit 2. In contrast to
the PBA’s contention, the cost of Officer Pellegrino's base salary
must be included in the calculations for the successor contract term
because he was employed by the Borough as of December 31,
2014. The PBA offers no authority in support of its position that
Officer Pellegrino should not be included because he was in the
academy for his first six months of hire and thus not a “swom”
officer as of December 31, 2014. To the contrary, Officer
Pellegrino is a member of the PBA unit. His salary at the first step
of the salary guide, “Police Academy Basic Training,” was governed
by the salary guide in the PBA collective bargaining agreement and
his salary was paid by the Borough. It is irrelevant to the analysis
that Officer Pellegrino had not yet been sworn in as a police officer
as of December 31, 2014. Officer Pellegrino, the most junior
officer, receives the largest increases throughout the successor
contract term, His increases total 40.50% over three years (using
Borough figures with applicable mid-year salary increases) or
38.86% (using PBA figures). Omitting Officer Pellegrino frees up
$16,224 (using PBA figures) which falls within the 2.0% cap,
illegally making $16,224 available to increase the base salaries for
the other officers. See Exhibit 3.

The third main area of disagreement is over the amounts of salary that

each has attributed to the other party's proposal. The Borough calculates the

36
costs of the PBA’s proposal for 2015, 2016 and 2017 as 3.53%, 5.51% and
1.01% respectively, amounts that il alleges far exceed the cap. The PBA rejects
the Borough's calculations and submits that its own calculations, according to its
methodology, fall within the 2% statutory cap. As previously stated, the PBA also
rejects the manner in which the Borough has calculated its own proposals
because it views the Borough as having charged to the cap certain rollovers from

one year to the next, especially with regard to the first year.

Because | do not award either party's salary proposal, it is unnecessary to
engage in a detailed analysis as to the merits of each party's arguments that
center on disagreeing with the other party's method of calculation. | am duty
bound to render an award that does not exceed the 2% salary cap based upon
$1,852,333 on 2014 base salaries that yields a cap amount of $37,047 over the
course of the new contract plus a compounded amount for each successive
contract year after the initial contract year and to make those calculations based
upon the required methodology established by PERC. As | have previously
found, these amounts are $37,047 and $37,789 and $38,543 and $39,315 or a

total of $152,694. N.J.S.A. 34:134-16.7 permits the distribution of the aggregate

 

monetary value of the award in unequal annual percentages to be not greater

than the compounded value of a 2% increase per year.

In deciding the application of these amounts, | am bound by PERC case

law as set forth in Borough of New Milford, P.E.R.C. No. 2012-53, 38 NUPER 340

37
(| 116 2012) and Borough of Ramsey, P.E.R.C. No. 2012-60, 39 NUPER 17 (413
2012) and their progeny. A summary of arbitral authority was recently set forth in

State_of New Jersey and FOP Lodge 91, P.E.R.C. NO. 2016-11 (2016). In

 

pertinent part, it stated the following

Definitions relative to police and fire arbitration;
limitation on awards.

a. As used in this section

“Base salary’ means the salary provided pursuant to
a salary guide or table and any amount provided
pursuant to a salary increment, including any amount
provided for longevity or length of service. It also shalt
include any other item agreed to by the parties, or any
other item that was included in the base salary as
understood by the parties in the prior contract. Base
salary shall not include non-salary economic issues,
pension and health and medical insurance costs

“Non-salary economic issues” means any economic
issue that is not included in the definition of base
salary.

». An arbitrator shall not render any award pursuant to
section 3 of P.L.1977, 6.85 (C.34:13A-16) which, in
the first year of the collective negotiation agreement
awarded by the arbitrator, increases base salary
items by more than 2.0 percent of the aggregate
amount expended by the public employer on base
salary items for the members of the affected
employee organization in the twelve months
immediatety preceding the expiration of the collective

38
negotiation agreement subject to arbitration. In each
subsequent year of the agreement awarded by the
arbitrator, base salary items shall nol be increased by
more than 2.0 percent of the aggregate amount
expended by the public employer on base salary
items for the members of the affected employee
organization in the immediately preceding year of the
agreement awarded by the arbitrator

The parties may agree, or the arbitrator may decide,
to distribute the aggregate monetary value of the
award over the term of the collective negotiation
agreement in unequal annual percentage increases,
which shall not be greater than the compounded
value of a 2.0 percent increase per year over the
corresponding length of the collective negotiation
agreement. An award of an arbitrator shall not include
base salary items and non-salary economic issues
which were not included in the prior collective
negotiations agreement.

In Borough of New Milford, P.E.R.C. No. 2012-53, 38 NJPER 340
(116 2012), we modified our review standard to include a
determination of whether the arbitrator established that the award
would not exceed the Hard Cap. ... [The Commission has
consistently authorized the arbitrator's approach to caloulating
increases in base salary items for those unit members remaining in
the unit after the base year. In New Milford, the Commission
endorsed the following method for “costing out’ an_ interest
arbitration award within the parameters of the 2% Hard Cap

Since an arbitrator, under the new law, is required to
project costs for the entirety of the duration of the
award, calculation of purported savings resulting from
anticipated retirements, and for that matter added
costs due to replacement by hiring new staff or
promoting existing staff are all too speculative to be
calculated at the time of the award. The Commission
believes that the better model to achieve compliance
with P.L. 2010 ¢ 105 is to utilize the scattergram
demonstrating the placement on the guide of all of the
employees ip the bargaining unit as of the end of the
year preceding the initiation of the new contract, and
io simply move those employees forward through the
newly awarded salary scales and __ longevity
entitlements. Thus, both reductions in costs resulting

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

39
from _retirements_or otherwise, as well_as any
increases in costs stemming from promotions or
additional new hires would not effect the costing out
of the award required by the new amendments to the

 

 

 

 

 

[New Milford at 344, emphasis added]

In Borough of Ramsey, P.E.R.C. No. 2012-60, 39 NJPER 17 (13
2012), we rejected the union's assertion that the arbitrator should
have taken into account a recent retirement and recent promotions
when projecting salary costs in the award, finding:

In New Milford, we determined that reductions in
costs resulting from retirements or otherwise, or
increases in costs stemming from promotions or
additional new hires, should not affect the costing out
of the award. N.J.S.A. 34:13a-16,7(b) speaks only to
establishing a baseline for the agaregate amount

expended by the public employer on base salary
items for the twelve months immediately preceding
the expiration of the collective negotiation agreement
subject to arbitration. The statute does not provide for
a majority representative to be credited with savings
that a public employer receives from any reduction in
costs, nor does it provide for the majority
fepresentative to be debited for any increased costs
the public employer assumes for promotions or other
costs associated with maintaining its workforce.

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

[Ramsey at 20, emphasis added]

| am bound by the methodology set forth in the above case law and will
apply it to the salary award. | next apply the evidence of this case to the
statutory criteria and the statutory salary cap. Initially, | note that the salary cap
does not in every case automatically determine what the salary result should be.
Its relevance and applicability in an arbitration proceeding is dependent on
whether the evidence points to the probability that, in the absence of the cap, an

amount that could exceed the cap could potentially be justified. In the instant

40
case, the PBA has produced credible evidence that supports an award that could
excced the cap. | need not proceed beyond the fact that normal movement on
the salary guide in accordance with its own terms, even without any increase to
the salary guides, would require funds that exceed the cap. Moreover, the
Borough does not contend that an award that expends funds up to the cap
limitation would compel it to exceed the tax cap levy of create adverse financial
impact on the Borough. The percentages that represent the cap is generally
consistent with the cost of living data. Even if such data exceeded the cap, the
data would be irrelevant because it could not support an award that exceeds the
cap. In short, an award less than what could lawfully be awarded would not
represent a reasonable determination of the salary issue. Further, comparability
evidence reflects interest arbitration awards in the County have resulted in salary
increases that are al the level of the statutory salary cap. Voluntary settlements
can exceed the cap but are of no evidentiary value given the requirements that
awarded salary increases cannot exceed the statutory salary cap. The most
compelling criteria are the interests and welfare of the public (N.J.S.A. 34:13A-

16g(1)), the lawful authority of the employer (N.J.S.A. 34:13A-16g(5)) and the

 

statutory restriction on the employer (N.J.S.A. 34:13A-16g(9)). These criteria
lead to the conclusion that salary increases are warranted but only to the extent
allowable by law. Accordingly, the salary award will be the maximum of what can
lawfully be awarded and thus, compel expenditures up to, but not in excess of,

the statutory salary cap.

at
Due to the requirements of the statutory salary cap, unit employees
cannot be moved through the salary guides even after they have met contractual
eligibility standards to do so, even if all of the steps on the salary guides were to
Temain frozen for four years. The obvious reason, as is known to the parties, is
that the costs of step movement alone exceed the amounts of funds that can be
awarded. Simply put, the large number of existing steps on the salary guide that
would require greater monies than what can be awarded to fund incremental

movements toward the maximum step. | next turn to the parties’ proposals.

| decline to award the Borough's proposal due to the significant increase in
the number of steps that the Borough would add to the salary guides that already
have a higher than average number of steps. The additional 9 and 8 steps to be
added to two of the existing salary schedules cannot be justified and would stand
in stark contrast to the number of steps contained in comparable salary
schedules, | also decline to award the PBA’s proposal because, as it is
calculated, the amounts necessary to fund the proposal would require this award
to exceed the statutory salary cap pursuant to the mandates set forth in
applicable case law, In particular, the PBA does not include Officer Peligrino in
its cost projections. It removes the costs of Officer Albert who separated from

employment during the 2016 contract year.

Officer Pelligrino’s salary of $41,752 for 2014 was determined by his

placement on the third salary schedule (Employees hired on or after March 28,

42
2012) at the Police Academy Basic Training step upon his September 25, 2014
date of hire. This salary schedule has a Year 1 step of $51,804 that Officer
Pelligrino moved to on March 25, 2014. Applicable case law requires that Officer
Pelligrino’s salary increases in 2015 beyond where he was placed on the
December 31, 2014 scattergram must be charged to the 2% cap. The PBA's
contention that he was net in the bargaining unit on January 1, 2016 is
understandable because it would avoid his 2015 increase to be charged to the
cap. However, this contention is inconsistent with the fact that his original
placement on the Police Academy Basic Training step was the result of the
negotiated salary schedule. it also runs counter to the applicable case law cited
above:

{To utilize the scattergram demonstrating the placement on the

guide of all of the employees in the bargaining unit as of the end of

the year preceding the initiation of the new contract, and to simply

move those employees forward through the newly awarded salary

scales and longevity entitlements.

Borough of New Milford and PBA Local 83, 38 NJPER [116 (2012)

 

The PBA’s contention with respect to Officer Albert Is also without merit. His
separation from employment during 2015 does not allow for a subtraction of his
$51,804 salary from the amounts the Borough was required to project to spend
due to his employment at $51,804 on the December 31, 2014 scattergram. As

stated in New Milford:

{Bloth reductions in costs resulting from retirements or otherwise,
as well as any increases in costs stemming from promotions or
additional new hires would not effect the costing out of the award

required by the new amendments to the Interest Arbitration Reform
Act.

Iso, Borough of Ramsey:

The statute does not provide for a majority representative to be
credited with savings that a public employer receives from any
reduction in costs, nor does it provide for the majority
representative to be debited for any increased costs the public
employer assumes for promotions or other costs associated with
maintaining its workforce.

Borough of Ramsey, P.E.R.C. No. 2012-60, 39 NJPER 17 (fi3
2012)

This methodology, as required by PERG case law, was applied by this arbitrator

in State_of New Jersey and New Jersey Law Enforcement Supervisors

 

 

This matter was appealed and affirmed by PERC [P.E.R.C. No. 2014-60] on

March

ion, PERC Dkt. No. 1A-2014-003, decided January 21, 2014. That case

Significantly, the aggregate amount of what is the maximum
allowable amount must be placed on the scattergram, or number of
employees, who are employed as of the last date of the contract
year of contract expiration on June 30, 2011. PERC then requires
the aggregate amount to be distributed to that scattergram over the
entire contract period as if all of the employees continued to be
employed without any impact from new hires or retirements.

10, 2014. In that decision, PERC held:

We affirm the arbitrator's salary award and find that his selection of
the State’s scattergram is consistent with our direction in New
Milford. We reject NJLESA's argument that the savings realized by
the State in FY 12 and 13 are to be credited to the unit. As we
indicated in New Milford, the base salary calculation may not
increase by more than 2% per year, or 6% in the aggregate for a
three year contract award, the amount expended by the employer
in the last year of the prior agreement, NJ.S.A. 34:13A-16.7(b)
Whether speculative or known, we again hold that any changes in
financial circumstances benefitting the employer or majority
representative are not contemplated by the statute or to be
considered by the arbitrator. See Borough of Ramsey (Holding that
the interest arbitration statute does not provide for a majority
Tepresentative to be credited with savings that a public employer
receives from any reduction in costs in the new contract years)
We also note that we have recently reversed the dynamic status
que doctrine as a matter of Commission policy and no longer
require employers to pay salary increments upon contract
expiration. See Atlantic County, P.E.R.C. No. 2014-40, __ NJPER

— (i 2013), app. pending: and State-Operated School Dist. of
the City of Paterson, P.E.R.C. No. 2014-48, NUPER (2014).

 

Accordingly, for 2015, the cap amount of $37,047 shall be awarded and
applied to the salaries and personnel included in the December 21, 2014
Scattergram that contained base salary costs of $1,762,514. Because Officer
Pelligrino was advanced to the Year 1 step at $51,804 on March 26, 2015, the
costs between his $41,752 salary on December 31, 2014 and his $51,804
prorated salary for 2015, the amount of $7,516 for year 2015 must be included
within the $37,047.? | have apportioned the remainder of the amount that can be

awarded in 2015 ($29,531) in the following manner and for the following reasons.

| have conciuded that a reasonable determination of the salary issue
should be one that does not expand the existing number of steps on the salary
schedules either in 2015 or in the remaining contract years and requires that

each unit employee remain on his or her step as of the December 31, 2014

 

* Omticer Pelligrino was the only officer to be moved on the salary schedule during 2015. All
others were frozen and there are no step cost increases associated with any other employee.

45
scatlergram throughout the contract duration. Although unit officers cannot
receive their full amount of step increases, the maintenance of the existing salary
structure will contribute to facilitating the parties’ future salary negotiations with or
without the existence of a statutory cap on salary increases. Because the
amounts that can be awarded cannot cover what the normal step increases
would have required, | find that a common method of distribution for ail unit
employees is the most reasonable and equitable approach towards the salary
increases. Accordingly, the remaining $29,531 shall be evenly distributed to the
steps occupied by employees on December 31, 2014 in equal dollar amounts to
each step on each of the three salary schedules by the addition of $1,555 to
each step effective January 1, 2015, To de othenwise could result in selective
and disproportionate increases being awarded to various unit employees to the

detriment of a majority of the others.

| award an identical method of distribution of salary cap monies for 2016,
2017 and 2018. This method of distribution would continue to award increases in
equal dollar amounts as the most reasonable and equitable method of
distribution. Each unit member, defined as all employees receiving a salary as
determined by their placement on a step set forth in any of the three existing
salary schedules as of December 31, 2014, shall receive $1,988 in 2016 by
adding this amount to the adjusted 2015 step, $2,028 in 2017 added to the
adjusted 2016 step and $2,069 in 2018 added to the adjusted 2017 step,

effective January 1 of each calendar year in 2016, 2017 and 2018. Each such

46
employee shall remain on his or her salary step that was occupied as of
December 31, 2014° throughout 2015, 2016, 2017 and 2018 and for future
Purposes retain his or her anniversary date based upon date of hire pursuant to

Articie IA). Accordingly, the salary award is as follows:

1. Officer Pelligrino shall advance to the Year One Step in 2015
upon his advancement to that step upon completion of the
Police Academy.

2. In 2015, each step in each of the three salary schedules
shall be increased by $1,555 effective and retroactive to
January 1, 2015. In 2016, 2017 and 2018, each step of the
three salary schedules shall be increased by $1,988 in 2016,
$2,028 in 2017 and $2,069 in 2018. All current employees
who were employed on the December 31, 2014 scattergram
shall receive the increases.

3. Each unit employee shall remain on his or her step as of the
December 31, 2014 scattergram throughout the contract
duration, except for Officer Pelligrino who shall remain at the
Year One Step.

4, Any modification to staffing during this contract term shall
result in employees being placed on the appropriate salary
schedules as modified.

Accordingly, and based upon ali of the above, | respectfully enter the

terms of this Award.

This decision arises out of an impasse to be resolved by an interest
arbilration proceeding between the Franklin Lakes PBA Local 150 [the “PBA” or
“Union’] and the Borough of Franklin Lakes [the ‘Employer’ or “Borough”]. Prior
lo this proceeding, the parties conducted mediation sessions with a jointly
selected mediator but were unable to reach an agreement. On July 21, 2015, |
was randomly selected by the New Jersey Public Employment Relations
Commission ["PERC’] to serve as interest arbitrator in accordance with N.J.S.A,

34:13A-16e(1).

 

The legal requirements for this case are those set forth in N.

34:13A-16 through NuJ.S.A. 34:13A-16.9 as amended on June 24, 2014 by P.L.

 

2014, ¢ 11, These provisions took effect immediately and were retroactive to
April 2, 2014. The existing contract has a termination date of December 31,
2014. Because the petition was filed on June 18, 2015, PERC processed the

interest arbitration petition under the amended statute. N.J.S.A. 34:13A-16b(3)

 

Tequires that the arbitrator hold an initial meeting with the parties for the purpose
of conducting a mediation. That session was held on August 20, 2015. It was
determined that the impasse could not be resolved voluntarily at that time and

the matter then proceeded to formal interest arbitration.

Final offers from each party were received on September 4, 2015. A
formal interest arbitration hearing was held on September 11, 2015. An

additional attempt to mediate the impasse prior to the hearing was not
successful. The parties were aware that the flexibility to resolve the impasse
without having to be subject to the statutory salary cap would no longer be
present if the impasse proceeded to an award. At hearing, substantial
documentary evidence was submitted into the record on all aspects of the
statutory criteria, as well as on salary cap calculations. Post-hearing briefs were
due and filed on September 28, 2015. They were transmitted to each party on
that day. On October 14, 2015, the PBA filed a motion to strike certain exhibits
filed by the Borough with its post-hearing brief. On October 15, 2015, the
Borough filed a statement in opposition to the motion.’ Pursuant to P.L. 2014, ¢.
11, the arbitrator has 90 days from appointment, or by October 19, 2015, in

which to render an award.

In accordance with the statute, each party submitted a last and final offer.

BACKGROUND

The municipality of the Borough of Franklin Lakes is located in Bergen
County in an area commonly defined geographically as Northwest Bergen. Other
municipalities considered to be included in northwest Bergen County are
Allendale, Gienlock, HoHoKus, Midland Park, Oakland, Saddle River, Ramsey,
Ridgewood, Waldwick and Wyckoff. The bargaining unit consists of patrol
officers and sergeants. In total there are eighteen (18) employees in the

bargaining unit but there were nineteen (19) as of December 31, 2014.

The existing collective negotiations agreement contains complex salary
schedules containing three tiers based upon date of hire. In addition, the “steps”
on the salary schedules in many instances are based upon a grouping of years of
service rather than on an annual basis. | refer to these types of groupings as
bands. Further, the parties, at a prior point of time, eliminated a longevity
Schedule and folded longevity payments into certain steps on the salary
schedule, This has resulted in an elongated salary schedule based upon the
number of years of service. The Agreement also provides that eligibility for
advancement to the next higher patroiman’s grade is based upon their
anniversary date of employment. An exception is for those who attain the rank of
Patroiman Year 18 who receive the appropriate negotiated salary on the first day
of January of each succeeding year. In addition, assignments to the Detective
Bureau/Juvenile Bureau and Traffic Bureau yield an increase of 1.5%. The

respective proposals of the parties reflect that the PBA seeks to maintain the
existing salary schedules while the Borough seeks to amend the step schedule to
add nine (9) steps to members hired between January 1, 1999 and March 27,

2012 and to add 8 steps for members hired on or after March 27, 2012.

The record reflects that the residents of the Borough employs a higher
than normal income. It has over 10,000 residents and its median household
income of $153,681 ranks thirteenth (13") in New Jersey. The Borough points
out that its budgeting process requires that it adhere to the 2% tax levy cap, as
well as the statutory cap on salary increases that can be awarded in arbitration
However, it does not assert that it has an inability to pay increases that fall within

the statutory limitations or that adverse financial impact would result from same.

The parties are in substantial dispute over the method upon which salary
increases can be calculated pursuant to the statutory cap on the amount that an
interest arbitrator can award under the amended statute. Their respective
positions on this will be evaluated during the analysis on the salary portion of this
award. In addition, the disputed issues are extensive, including the PBA's
proposal to reduce employee medical contributions, to increase the clothing
allowance and to provide that mandatory training be conducted on an overtime
rate basis. The parlies disagree on the term of the Agreement and also the
Borough's proposal to award increases in the number of steps to the existing
salary schedules, ta reduce the amount of clothing allowance, to reduce the

annual sick leave allowance, to replace the existing medical insurance plan with
a new plan, to limit retiree medical coverage for new hires until they reach 65
years of age and to require retirees to receive the same level of retiree benefits
as those provided to current employees effective December 31, 2019. Because
of the extremely limited period of time between receipt of post-hearing briefs and
the due date of an award, the issues must be decided without engaging in an
exhaustive summary of the parties’ arguments and evidence. Each issue will be
considered individually, followed by an award setting forth all of the issues

awarded representing changes to the existing collective negotiations agreement,

DISCUSSION

The statute requires the arbitrator to make a reasonable determination of
the disputed issues giving due weight to those factors set forth in NJS.A
34:13A-169(1) through (9) that are relevant to the resolution of the issues. These

factors, commonly called the statutory criteria, are as follows:

(1) The interests and welfare of the public. Among the items the
arbitrator or panel of arbitrators shall assess when
considering this factor are the limitations imposed upon the
employer by (P.L. 1976, c. 68 (C. 40A:4-45.1 et seq}.

(2) Comparison of the wages, salaries, hours, and conditions of
employment of the employees involved in the arbitration
proceedings with the wages, hours, and conditions of
employment of other employees performing the same or
similar services and with other employees generally:

(2) In private employment in general; provided,
however, each party shall have the right to
submit additional evidence for the arbitrator's
consideration.
3)

(4)

(8)

6)

{b) In public employment in general; provided,
however, each party shall have the right to
submit additional evidence for the arbitrator's
consideration.

(€) In public employment in the same or similar
comparable jurisdictions, as determined in
accordance with section 5 of P.L. 1995. c. 425
(C.34:13A-16.2) provided, however, each party
shall have the right to submit additional
evidence conceming the comparability of
jurisdictions for the arbitrator's consideration.

The overall compensation presently received by the
employees, inclusive of direct wages, salary, vacations,
holidays, excused leaves, insurance and pensions, medical
and hospitalization benefits, and all other economic benefits
received.

Stipulations of the parties.

The lawful authority of the employer. Among the items the
arbitrator or panel of arbitrators shall assess when
considering this factor are the limitations imposed upon the
employer by the P.L. 1976 c. 68 (C.40A:4-45 et sea )

The financial impact on the governing unit, its residents and
taxpayers. When considering this factor in a dispute in
which the public employer is a county or a municipality, the
arbitrator or panel of arbitrators shall take into account to the
extent that evidence is introduced, how the award will affect
the municipal or county purposes element, as the case may
be, of the local property tax; a comparison of the percentage
of the municipal purposes element, or in the case of a
county, the county purposes element, required to fund the
employees’ contract in the preceding local budget year with
that required under the award for the current local budget
year, the impact of the award for each income sector of the
property taxpayers on the local unit; the Impact of the award
on the ability of the governing body to (a) maintain existing
local programs and services, (b) expand existing local
programs and services for which public moneys have been
designated by the governing body in a proposed local
budget, or (c) initiate any new programs and services for
which public moneys have been designated by the
governing body in its proposed local budget.
(7) The cost of living.

(8) The continuity and stability of employment including seniority
tights and such other factors not confined te the foregoing
which are ordinarily or traditionally considered in the
determination of wages, hours and conditions of employment
through collective negotiations and collective bargaining
between the parties in the public service and in private
employment.

(8) Statutory restrictions imposed on the employer. Among the

items the arbitrator or panel of arbitrators shall assess when
considering this factor are the limitations imposed upon the
employer by section 10 of P.L. 2007, c. 62 (C.40A:4-45.45).

My review of the criteria must be accomplished based upon the evidence
presented as well as the application of well established standards in collective
negotiations and interest arbitration. The party seeking to modify existing terms
and conditions of employment has a burden to prove that there is basis for its
Proposed change. The burden to be met must be at a level beyond a party
seeking additional benefits or concessions to existing terms and conditions of
employment without sufficient evidentiary support. No proposed issue by either
party will be deemed to be presumptively valid in the absence of justification that
is supported by credible evidence. | also observe that a proposal may not be
viewed in isolation to all other proposals. Any decision to award or deny any
individual issue in dispute will include consideration as to the reasonableness of
that individual issue in relation to the terms of the entire award. In other words,
there may be merit to awarding or denying a single issue if it were to stand alone,

but a different conclusion may be reached after assessing its merits within the

context of all of the changes that are included in the overall award.
DURATION

The PBA proposes a three year agreement, effective January 1, 2015
through December 31, 2017, The Borough proposes a five year agreement,
effective January 1, 2015 through December 31, 2019. Almost a full year has
passed since contract expiration. Regardless of the contract duration awarded.
the parties are subject to the statutory salary cap on the amount of salary that
can be awarded. In addition, the record reflects stability in the Borough's
finances and a continuity and stability of employment that serve as a proper

basis for a contract duration of January 1, 2015 through December 31, 2018.

ARTICLE IX - CLOTHING ALLOWANCE

 

Both parties have proposals to change the amount of clothing allowance
currently paid under Article IX(8). The existing benefit provides

Each Police Officer shall receive an annual clothing allowance.

‘The amount of clothing allowance is $650.00. Said amount shall be

paid in a lump sum amount on the first day in January, provided

that a newly hired officer shall not be entitled t0 such allowance

during the same year that he has been provided with an initial issue

of clothing and equipment in accordance with Paragraph A above.

The Borough proposes to reduce the allowance to $150, effective January
1, 2016. It submits:

Officers currently receive a $650 annual clothing allowance plus a
$360 annual uniform maintenance allowance, or a total clothing

44
allowance benefit of $1,000 per year. Assuming that this decrease
is effective on January 1, 2016, the clothing allowance decrease
will save the Borough $850 per officer times nineteen (19) officers
or $16,150 per year. As a percentage of 2014 total base salaries,
this proposal will reduce the Borough's costs by 0.87%
($16, 150/$1,852,333 x 100) in 2016. The savings will continue in
2017, 2018 and 2019 and beyond.

The PBA proposes to increase the clothing allowance by $250 annually

and urges rejection of the Borough's proposal, It argues:

The PBA proposes an increase to the clothing allowance. The
amount of the clothing allowance has been stagnant over the past
several years. An adjustment for the increase in the cost of living is
appropriate in this case by way of an increase to the clothing
allowance. The members of the PBA have been subjected to
increased payments over the last five years including healthcare
contributions, increased pension contributions, higher healthcare
costs, among others.

There is a [Borough] proposal to reduce the clothing allowance
from $650 annually to $150 annually. While this will save the
employer a few dollars the impact will be larger on the individual
members. Over a three year contract each employee will lose
$1500. This would negate any increase for the members at top pay
and significantly reduce step increases for the lowest paid
members. The employer cannot provide any basis for such a
drastic reduction. In fact, the employer's own chart shows that the
PBA is gets less than the average of the ather towns cited by the
employer. As the PBA proposal requests, the amount for the
clothing allowance should be increased just based upon the
increased cost of living. Cost for purchasing uniforms increases
each year, it does not go down. Taking the huge chunk out of the
clothing allowance that the employer is seeking does nothing more
than further harm the members

Award

After review of the parties’ proposals, | do not find merit to any alteration of

the status quo. The existing level of clothing allowance is reasonable based

12
upon all relevant comparisons and no persuasive justification has been offered
by either party for an increase or decrease in the existing level of benefit.

Accordingly, both proposals are denied

GRIEVANCE SETTLEMENT

The parties have a pending unresolved grievance concerning prescription
co-pays for retirees. The Borough proposes that a settlement of the grievance

be awarded. Its proposal is as follows:

The Borough proposes to resolve a grievance arbitration over
prescription co-pays. The grievance arbitration is pending before
Arbitrator Martin Scheinman, the parties have agreed to stay the
grievance arbitration pending the conclusion of this interest
arbitration matter. Like SHBP, the Borough implemented higher
prescription co-pays for its retirees than its active employees. The
PBA filed a grievance, asserting that the Borough violated the
requirement that it provide "the same level of such benefits
received at the time of retirement” to its retirees. In other words,
the PBA asserted that the retirees should pay the same prescription
co-pays in effect at the fime they retired. The Borough proposes to
resolve the grievance by amending coverage for existing retirees
prospectively, effective as of the date of the award, to provide co-
insurance at the same level as provided on the date of retirement.
The Borough, however, declines to provide co-insurance at the
same level a8 provided on date of retirement for claims based on
coverage prior to the date of the award

The PBA seeks rejection of the Borough's proposal:

The employer has included the settlement of a grievance in its final
proposal that is currently pending grievance arbitration. The parties
had agreed to put off the hearing while they were attempting to
reach a settlement on the contract. However, now that this matter
has proceeded to arbitration, there is no authority for this matter to
be resolved in an interest arbitration award. This is especially so
since there is no evidence in the record regarding the underlying
dispute. This proposal should be denied on its face.

Award

| decline to award the Borough's proposal. This matter arose under the
prior labor agreement and is a matter of contract interpretation before an
arbitrator who has been appointed under the parties’ selection procedure. An
imposition of settlement terms would infringe on the PBA’s right to a
determination on the grievance it filed in accordance with the contractual

grievance procedure

ARTICLE X

 

ICK LEAVE

 

Article X sets forth a comprehensive scheme for sick leave. The Borough
proposes to reduce the number of annual sick days from twelve (12) sick days to

ten (10) sick days per year effective January 1, 2016. {t asserts:

Currently, all officers receive twelve (12) sick days per year
Employees who do not use all of their accrued sick time are entitled
to one-half a day's pay for each unused sick day per calendar year.
Although the savings cannot be calculated with certainty, the
reduction of sick time from twelve (12) sick days to ten (10) sick
days per year results in a savings to the Borough of about one (1)
day's pay for each officer. In accordance with traditional labor
principals, one day of pay equals about 0.33%, As a result, the
Borough will attribute a 0.33% savings to this proposal in 2016

The PBA submits that there is no basis or evidentiary support to award the

Borough's proposal. It argues:

4
There is no evidence in the record of sick time abuse. Twelve sick
days per year can hardly be said to be excessive. While there may
be some municipalities with ten sick days, there are probably twice
as many that have fifteen sick days. For example, the agreement
between Glen Rock and the PBA (U-18) provides for twenty sick
days annually, Paramus and Ridgewood provide for fifteen days
per year. (U-20; U-22), There is no basis for a reduction in sick
days in this case.

Award

Beyond the Borough's attribution of approximately 0.33% in savings that it
would receive if its proposal were awarded, there is insufficient evidence to
support this concessionary proposal. The number of sick days received is not
beyond the norm, and there is no data reflecting that there has been an

excessive use of sick leave. Accordingly, the Borough's proposal is denied

ARTICLE XvVill - ATTENDANCE AT TRAINING COURSES

 

The parties have negotiated a provision governing compensation for

required attendance at in-service training courses. It states:

In the event the Chief of Police shall require any officer or
patrolman to attend a specific in-service training course for the
development of a skill not otherwise available to the Police
Department through any of its members, such officer or patrolman
shall receive compensation at a pro-rated hourly rate based upon
the appropriate salary schedule or compensatory time off equal to
the time spent in attendance at the training course, with a minimum
of 3 hours. The method of compensation shall be determined by
the Chief of Police. Nothing contained herein shall be construed as
to permit to any officer or patrolman for attendance at an in-service
course which is not specifically required to be taken as required
above.
The PBA seeks to modify the compensation component of Article XVIII to

require that its members receive their overtime rate for training.

The Borough urges denial of the PBA's proposal. It submits the following

statement in opposition:

The PBA proposes that members receive theit overtime rate for
training. Article XVIll, Attendance at Training Courses, provides
that officers receive compensation at a pro-rated hourly rate or
compensatory time off equal to the time spent in attendance at the
training course, subject to a minimum of three (3) hours for training
The Chief presently determines the method of compensation. The
PBA’s proposal will result in increased costs during the contract
term, but these costs are too speculative to calculate because the
Borough does not know the number of hours its police officers will
spend attending training during the successor contract term.

The 2010 Amendments also bar an award of the PBA’s training
compensation proposal. N.J.S.A. § 34:13A-16.7(b) precludes the
arbitrator from rendering an award that includes non-salary
economic issues which were not included in the predecessor
agreement. Because the PBA’s training compensation proposal
has economic ramifications, it constitutes a “non-salary economic
issue” within the meaning of the 2010 Amendments. The 2010
Amendments therefore preclude an award of he PBA's training
compensation proposal

Award

| need not address the Borough's argument that N.J.S.A. § 34:13A-16.7(b)
precludes the awarding of this non-salary economic issue. The PBA has not
sustained its burden of establishing sufficient merit upon which to award the

proposal to require overtime for required training. The existing provision appears

16
to have been negotiated with proper balance given to the competing interests
involved, including the requirement that a minimum of three hours be paid for any

participation in required training. Accordingly, the PBA’s proposal is denied

PRIVATE DUTY RATE

 

The Agreement does not specify the amount of payment to be received by
an officer for off-duty or private duty authorized work to be performed. The
Borough has proposed to increase the private duty rate from $70 to $86 per hour

and has already imptemented its proposal. It notes that:

Because the Borough is compensated by the outside contractor for
private duty costs, this proposal does not increase the Borough's
costs. The increase in the private duty rate, however, is a
substantial benefit for PBA members.

The PBA observes:

The employer passed an ordinance making the change and the
PBA did not oppose it. It was not part of the negotiations process.
Even if the employer argues that it was part of negotiations, it must
be determined that the increase was stipulated between the parties
as it has already gone into effect. If the employer were to
unilaterally lower this rate it would be subject to challenge by the
PBA. The PBA has no issue with the arbitrator finding this point
moot or stipulated between the parties.

Award

Given the parties’ mutual acknowledgement that there is no dispute as to

the increase in the private duty rate, | will award the Borough's proposal in a
fashion similar to having received a stipulation as authorized by NUS.A. §

34:43A-169(4).

HEALTH INSURANCE

Both parties have advanced proposals that deal with health insurance:

They will be reviewed individually.

Health Insurance Employee Contributions
(PBA Proposal)

 

Arlicle VII(B) obligates employees to contribute towards payment of
medical prescription and dental insurance in accordance with the provisions of
state law, The PBA has proposed to reduce employee contributions for medical
insurance by 50% commencing January 1, 2016. It supports its proposal as

follows:

The PBA proposes a fifty percent (50%) reduction in the medical
contributions that members make to their healthcare starting in
2016. All of the members of the PBA are contributing the full
amount of the medical care contribution as stated in Chapter 78,
Chapter 78 states:

‘Once those employees are subjected to the contribution
requirements set forth in subsection a. of this section,
the public employers and public employees shall be
bound by this act . . . to apply the contribution levels set
forth in section 39 of this act until all affected employees
are contributing the full amount of the contribution, as
determined by the implementation schedule set forth in
subsection a. of this section. Notwithstanding the
expiration date set forth in section 83 of this act . . . or
the expiration of any successor agreements, parties

18
shali_be bound to apply the requirements of this
paragraph _until_they have reached the full
implementation of the schedule set forth _in

Subsection a. of this section.

 

Specifically, N.J-S.A. 40A:10-21.2 states:

After full implementation, those contribution levels shall
become part of the parties’ collective negotiations and
shall then be subject to collective negotiations in a
manner similar to other negotiable items between the
parties.

Section 83 of Chapter 78, P.L. 2011 states:

This act shall take effect immediately, and sections 39

through 44, inclusive, shall expire four years after the
effective date

The effective date of the statute, N.J.S.A, 40A:10-21.2 was June
28, 2011. It is now expired. The contribution amounts are
negotiable. While there is a cap on salary increases, there is no
reason why an adjustment cannot be made to the healthcare
contribution in order to balance out the financial impact of the two
percent cap. As a result of the salary cap the members will not be
receiving their full step increases and those at the top step will be
getting a very small increase. A reduction in the contribution would
at least allow the members to have more money at their disposal,
although not part of salary with all of the benefits associated with
that.

As a result of the salary cap combined with the health care
contributions, the officers, especially those at top pay, have seen a
reduction in actual money they take home. Officers at top pay may
not get a raise over the course of a contract, yet they have been
paying approximately $10,000 for a family plan. The contribution is
negotiable and it is appropriate to make an adjusiment to the
contribution levels in this case. The parties jointly developed a
salary guide which led to a couple bubble steps which have the
result of using up most of the available money for any monetary
raise. This was not just the fault of the PBA, yet the PBA members
bear the brunt of its harsh results. There is no doubt that at some
point in the past, the employer benefitted from pushing off raises
which led to the bubble steps. Now, is attempting to get another
benefit by essentially blaming the large increases in those bubble
steps on the PBA. The employer wants a new salary scale forever
delaying the contractual salaries while maintaining the inordinately
high medical contribution levels.

While it is understood that the PBA can only propose salary
adjustments in accordance with the cap statute, it is within the
Powers of the arbitrator to adjust the medical contribution. Such an
adjustment would be an equitable adjustment to the stagnant
salaries and regressive legislation which the members of the PBA
have been subject to for the past several years.

The medical contribution is an ever rising cost to both the PBA
members and the employer. However, the PBA members have no
means to obtain more money to pay for their contribution other than
money available through negotiations and arbitration The
employer, on the other hand, can obtain more money, if necessary.

The Borough objects to the PBA’s proposal and submits that the proposal
the PBA has presented is pre-empted by law. It offers the following arguments in

support of its position:

Because the PBA’s collective bargaining agreement expired on
December 31, 2011, after Chapter 78 took effect, the contribution,
subject to a 4-year phase in at 25% per year, took effect in January
2012. Employees contributed at first year percentages in 2012,
second year percentages in 2013, and third year percentages in
2014, Employees contribute at fourth year percentages in 2015,
the first year of the successor contract determined by this interest
arbitration,

The Interest Arbitrator cannot implement the PBA’s health
insurance proposal to reduce employee contributions by 50%
effective January 1, 2016 because the PBA's proposal is
preempted by N.J.S.A. § 40A:10-21.2; the PBA cannot negotiate a
change in employee contribution amounts until the contract after full
implementation of the fourth year. NJSA. § 40A:10-212
provides, in relevant part,

A_public_employer_and_employees who _are_in
negotiations forthe next collective negotiation
agreement to be executed after the employees in that
unit have reached full implementation of the premium
share set forth in section 39 of PL. 2011, c. 78
(G.52:14-17.28c) shall conduct negotiations conceming

 

 

 

20
contributions for health care benefits as if the full
Premium share was included in the prior contract.
After full implementation, those contribution levels shail
become part of the parties’ collective negotiations and
shalt then be subject to collective negotiations in a
manner similar fo other negotiable items between the
parties.

Id. (emphasis added). Negotiations conceming contribution to
premiums therefore cannot occur until the collective negotiations
agreement after full implementation.

Local Finance Notice 2011-20R supports this interpretation. It
provides,

The law provides directive language that affects the
negotiations of CNA’s after full implementation of health
benefits contribution. . Once the fourth year has
been completed (100% of the required contribution has
been paid for a year), the law provides that:

2. Negotiations for the next contract shall be
conducted as if the full contribution was part of the
previous contract.
¢._ Once... [there is] full implementation, the
contribution structure is negotiable, starting from the
point of full implementation

Exhibit 7 at 11-12. Therefore, the Local Finance Notice provides
further support that the law bars negotiation of a reduction in
contribution to premiums until the collective bargaining agreement
after full implementation of four years of contributions.

Moreover, in Clementon Board of Education and Clementon
Education Associati P.E.R.C. No, 2016-10, 42 NJPER ___ (fl

2015), attached as Exhibit 8, PERC held that a proposal
made in negotiations for a successor collective bargaining
agreement to reduce empioyee health insurance premium
contributions was preempted by NJS.A § 18A:16-17.2. This
statutory section contains identical language to N.JS.A. § 40A:10-
21.2, the statute applicable to municipal police officers, among
other public employees.

 

 

In Clementon, the parties had a three year collective bargaining
agreement with a term from July 1, 2011 through June 30, 2044

2i
Chapter 78 became effective on June 28, 2011. Unit employees
began their required four years of contributions upon the expiration
of the predecessor contract at the first level on July 1, 2011. On
July 1, 2014, the first year of the successor collective bargaining
agreement under negotiations, the employees began their fourth
year of contributions. The union proposed that employee
contribution to premiums should be reduced to 1.5% of base salary
after full implementation of Chapter 78. In quoting NUSA §
18A:16-17.2, which contains identical language to NJSA §
40A:10-21.2, the statute applicable to municipal police officers,
PERC held that the health insurance reduction proposal was
preempted until negotiations for the agreement that followed full
implementation. The parties could, therefore, negotiate regarding a
reduction in health insurance contributions in the next contract
negotiations. See Exhibit 8. As in Clementon, the parties are in
negotiations with one year remaining to achieve full implementation
of Chapter 78. This fourth year will occur under the successor
agreement presently under negotiations. Therefore, N.JS.A. §
40A:10-21.2 preempts negotiation of a reduction of premium
contribution rates until after full implementation of Chapter 78; Le.,
upon the expiration of the successor contract, depending on the
duration of the successor contract awarded. The Interest Arbitrator
should therefore decline to award the PBA's proposal to reduce
employee health insurance contributions by 50% effective January
1, 2016.

Award

The PBA forcefully argues that the legisiative imposition of health
insurance contributions is “regressive” and that relief is necessary through
Negotiated reductions in contribution levels. The statute preempts negotiations
but provides language that lifts the preemption in favor of negotiations with the
statutory levels serving as the status quo. The parties dispute the point in time in

which the issue will become negotiable.

22
Nu.

 

. § 34:13A-16g(5) requires the arbitrator to apply the lawful

 

authority of the employer and N.JS.A. § 34:134-16g(9) requires application of
statutory restrictions on the employer. Given this, | am required to adhere to the
statute and existing case law that governs when the issue of health insurance
contributions becomes negotiable. The Borough’s contention is persuasive that,
given the relevant facts of this case, the PERC decision in Clementon Board of

Education and Clementon Education Asscciation, P.E.R.C. No. 2016-10, 42

 

NJPER __ (ff 2015), governs this issue and, therefore, the PBA's
proposal is preempted by law and cannot be awarded. Accordingly, the proposal

is denied.

Health Insurance Plans
(Borough Proposal)

Article VIIA) obligates the Borough to provide medical and hospitalization
coverage in accordance with the “BMED" (Bergen Municipal Employees Benefit
Fund). It propases to switch this coverage to the Aetna PPO 20/35 Plan. It

offers the following explanation in support of its proposal

The Borough proposes to amend Article Xill, Medical, Dental and
Life Insurance with respect to health insurance benefits for active
employees and for retirees. Specifically, for active employees, the
Borough wants to provide that BMED 20/35 Plan will be the highest
cost plan offered effective on January 1, 2016. The Borough does
not provide health insurance through the State Health Benefits Plan
(SHBP"). Instead, the Borough participates in the Bergen
Municipal Employees Benefit Fund (‘BMED"), a Health insurance
Fund (HIF"). The plans. they offer are designed to “match” the
plans offered under SHBP, giving rise to the plan names.
Presently, the Borough provides employees and their dependents

23
with a choice of nine plans. All PBA members who have not
waived medical insurance coverage selected medical and
hospitalization coverage under the BMED Direct 10 Match Plan, the
highest cost plan the Borough offers. To contain the spiraling costs
of health insurance, the Borough proposes to offer the Aetna PPO
20/35 Plan as its highest cost plan. In 2016, using an estimated
increase in insurance premiums, the Borough would save about
$29,447 from the plan change. See Cost Comparison, Direct 10
Match vs. Aetna PPO 20/35 Plan at E-1, Section 5. This
represents a savings of 1.58% ($29,447/$1,852,333 x 100) in 2016.
Using estimates based on an 8% annual increase in premium costs
and assuming no changes in selected plan coverage (ie., single,
family, etc.) the Borough would save $132,691 over the remaining
four years of the contract. See E-1, Section 5. Employees would
save $37,426 over the remaining four years of the contract term in
premium contributions. See E-1, Section 5. Because cost savings
are speculative, the Borough cannot definitively calculate the
savings this proposal would bring to the Borough.

The PBA objects to the Borough's proposal. It argues:

The change proposed by the employer for medical coverage has
been somewhat addressed above. It is clear from the submissions
that the employer is solely concemed with keeping the premiums
down in anticipation of the Cadillac Tax. As stated above, a three
year contract will give the parties the opportunity to negotiate over
health care benefits when it is better known if this tax is going to go
into effect. A change to the BMED 20/35 plan is not warranted and
not supported by the evidence. The employer has only provided
the fact that the plan is cheaper. Cheaper does not, on its face,
establish that the plan is equal to the benefits currently in effect
Without a thorough and detailed presentation on the intricacies of
the plan, there is no way to measure the financial effect of changing
plans. While the premiums may be lower, there most certainly will
be other increased costs which allowed the premium to be lowered.
Co-pay costs, deductisle amounts, out-of-network casts etc., must
all be considered when evaluating a health care plan. The mere
assertion that the premiums are less does not suffice to make a
drastic change to the benefits.

24
Award

The Borough has presented a proposal supported by the cost savings to
be achieved. The amounts stated in the Borough's arguments are consistent
with representations made at hearing. It points out that employees would also
save due to decreased premium costs upon which their contribution levels are
based. These savings are actual in contrast with speculative savings that could
arise from the projected imposition of the “Cadillac tax." Although the PBA
alleges an absence of evidence as to the detailed nature of plan design change,
the record does not support this argument. The proposed plan has, without
objection, been presented as one that provides comprehensive health care
coverage that patterns the New Jersey State Health Benefits Plan. The interests
and welfare of the public are not furthered by the Borough having to continue to
bear the burdensome costs of health care coverage under the existing plan

Accordingly, | award the Borough's proposal.

Retiree Health Benefits
(Borough Proposals)

The Agreement, at Article VIII(D) provides for retiree health insurance. It

states:

For employees who retire after twenty (20) years of service to the
Borough and twenty-five (25) years in the pension system, the
Borough will provide full (100%) medical insurance, dental,
prescription, and family or spousal coverage, at the same level of
such benefits received at the time of retirement. Insurance
coverage for fully relied (25 years of service) employees, as

authorized herein, is secondary to any coverage or benefits
available or which may become available from Medicare or any
other sources of insurance, governmental or — otherwise.
Additionally, such coverage as may be provided by the Borough,
will be discontinued for any period when insurance coverage is
obtained as a result of other employment, but will be reinstated
upon the termination of such employment.

The Borough seeks to modify the above provision as follows:

The Borough proposes two modifications to retiree health benefits.
First, the Borough proposes, effective on the date of the award,
new hires receive medical coverage from their retirement until they
reach age 65. Presently, officers receive medical coverage upon
their retirement for life, secondary to any coverage which becomes
available from Medicare or any other source. An award of this
proposal will result in significant savings to the Borough, but those
savings are too speculative to calculate.

Second, the Borough proposes to amend the contract language in
Paragraph D to provide that employees retiing on or after
December 31, 2019 will receive the same level of benefits as
provided to then-current employees. Presently, Paragraph D
provides, “For employees who retire after twenty (20) years of
service to the Borough and twenty-five years in the pension system,
the Borough will provide full (100%) medical insurance, dental,
prescription, and family or spousal coverage, at the same level of
such benefits received at the time of retirement.” (emphasis added)
The PBA interprets this language to mean that the Borough must
provide an employee who, by way of example, retired in 1985 with
the same health insurance benefits today as the employee received
in 1985 at the time he retired. The Borough finds this obligation
unworkable given the realities of today’s medical insurance market.
Not only is the level of benefits provided years ago cost prohibitive,
but plans providing such benefits may no longer exist. The
Borough's proposal will enable retirees to receive health insurance
benefits in tune with today’s insurance market by tying the level of
benefits provided to retirees to the level of benefits provided to
then-current employees. An award of this proposal will result in
significant savings to the Borough, but those savings are too
speculative to calculate.

‘The PBA objects to the Borough's proposals. It submits:

26
The employer is seeking to amend the contract to limit retiree
benefits for those members retiring afle: December 31, 2019 to the
level of benefits provided to current employees. Again, there has
been no evidence submitted in support of such a drastic change to
benefits. Health benefits are extremely valuable. There is no way
to tell what the future will bring with regard to these benefits. When
discussing retiree benefits we are discussing health care twenty or
thirty years from now. That would be completely unpredictable. In
the future employees may give up employer health care for some
other benefit. Where would that leave retirees? With no benefits?
Such an open ended, speculative proposal must be denied. .

This is also true for the proposal to end medical coverage at sixty-
five for new hires. There is still a cost associated with health care
after sixty-five. Members will have to purchase additional health
care plans such as Medicare Part B, to get complete coverage.
The employer is simply trying to ‘ay that cost off on the employee
without any basis for doing so.

Award

1 do not award either aspect of the Borough's proposals. Retiree health
insurance is an issue that can be revisited without prejudice to the Borough in
future negotiations after presenting a detailed review of the costs associated with
having to provide individual retiree health benefit plans for all retirees who are
subject to health insurance coverage. t is noted that the Borough’s proposal, if
awarded, would not be effective until December 31, 2019. Thus, the December
31, 2018 contract duration awarded permits sufficient time for the renewal of

negotiations on this issue.

SALARY

The Borough and the PBA have widely divergent positions on salary.
These include the amount of salary that can be awarded under the statutory cap,
the proper method for calculating those amounts and the structure of the salary

schedules to be awarded.

The first point of analysis is the structure of the existing salary schedules.
They are divided into three (8) separate schedules depending upon date of hire.

They are as follows, as set forth in Appendix A — Wages of the Agreement:

In order to place the parties’ proposals in their proper perspective, certain
observations are required to be made. First, each of the three salary schedules
covers two classes of officers, Patrolman and Sergeants. Second, each of the
Schedules provides for a salary or a step at a distinct year or years of experience
level, such as “Year 8.” It also includes bands based upon years of experience
level, such as “Years 20-24.” The two schedules involving employees hired on or
after March 28, 2012 and employees hired between January 1, 1999 and March
27, 2012 each have a Police Academy Basic Training step at $41,752 and a
Year One step of $51,804. The Year One step follows the six months that a

trainee successfully serves the Police Academy.

‘The salary steps, including the single salary steps and the salary bands,
suggest that an employee would advance to the next step upon achieving the
years of experience required to advance. However, in the prior contract, officers
moved only two steps in three years. Thus, as the PBA points out, “Year 8”

really was “Year 9.” Article Ill{A) provides language describing this structure and

30
modification to prior practice in the priot agreement, including temporary changes

in anniversary dates that normally would trigger step movement:

Except as follows, patrolmen shall become eligible for
advancement to the next higher patrolman's grade at their
anniversary date of employment as an officer with the Borough of
Franklin Lakes, During the life of this contract only, step movement
below Year 8 shail be every 18 months. For example, an employee
‘on step for Year 2 with a current anniversary date of October 15”
shall receive his next increment on April 15, 2013. The next
subsequent increment shall be on October 15, 2014, returning the
employee to the original anniversary date. Upon the 2014 return to
the original anniversary date, the next subsequent increment shall
return to the twelve months interval. Upon attaining the rank of
Patrolman year 18, an officer shall be entitled to the appropriate
negotiated salary for that year, on the first day of January of each
succeeding year.

An additional factor that provides some complexity to the existing salary
schedules is the fact that in the past the parties negotiated and included a
longevity provision into the Agreement that was separate and distinct from the
salary schedules. In the last Agreement, the parties voluntarily negotiated a
process that commonly referred to as a fold-in of longevity payments into the
steps of the salary schedule. It is for this reason that the salary guides in
Appendix A provide for steps and bands that exceed the level of twenty years of
experience, including steps defined as “Years 25+” and “Years 28+" and bands
such as “Years 23-27." The Borough explains this transition in its post-hearing
submission:

The salary guides in the collective bargaining agreement that

expired on December 31, 2014 require explanation. See J-1 at 14-

16. Franklin Lakes appears to have a lot of steps on its salary
guide because lhe salary guides preserved the once separate

3
longevity steps and incorporated them into the salary guide. The
sixteen (16) step guide for patrol officers hired after January 1,
1999 but on or before March 27, 2012, and the nineteen (19) step
guide for patrol officers hired on or after March 28, 2012 resulted
from the direct folding in of longevity benefits into base salary. The
steps in the salary guide that reflect folded in longevity benefits
provide significantly smaller increases than the steps that reflect
original step increases. With respect to sergeants and patrol
officers hired prior to January 1, 1999, all steps on the salary guide
reflect former longevity increases, For sergeants and patrol officers
hired between January 1, 1999 and March 27, 2012, all steps
above Year 8 reflect former longevity increases. Police Academy
Basic Training through Year 8 are true step increases, with officers
reaching maximum step at Year 8, after the completion of seven
years of service. The salary guide therefore has nine (8) steps
{Inclusive of two steps during the first year). For sergeants and
patrol officers hired on or after March 28, 2012, all steps above
Year 11 reflect former longevity increases. Police Academy Basic
Training through Year 11 are true step increases. Officers reach
maximum step after the completion of ten (10) years of service
The salary guide therefore has twelve (12) steps (inclusive of two
steps during the first year). See J-1 at 14-16.

The overview above is essential to understanding the rationale for the
parties’ respective final offers on salary and, to some extent, the basis for their
disagreements on future salary structure, including the number of steps and the
calculation of salary expenditures. Significantly, despite challenging each others’
method of calculation under the statutory salary cap, they have stipulated to the
first necessary step required for such calculation under the statute and applicable
case law. That is, that the 2014 expenditures by the Borough on 2014 base
salaries was $1,852,333 and that the cap amount of 2% that can be allotted
towards salary increases amounted to $37,047 in 2015. It is noted that that
amount is now allowed to be compounded annually so the total amount for a four

year agreement, by way of example, is $37,047, $37,789, $38,543 and $39,315

32
or a total of $152,684. The statute also authorizes the arbitrator to apportion
yearly amounts in a manner that equals this sum but permits its distribution in

varying annual amounts.

The extent to which the parties have disagreement over salaries despite
their concurrence on the applicability of the statutory salary cap, the gross
amounts paid out in salary for 2014 and the amounts that equate to 2%, is
evident in three major respects. The first disagreement is what the number of
steps should be on the new salary guides. The PBA proposes no change in the
number of steps. It instead focuses on the amounts of salary that it believes
each officer should be individually awarded in order to stay within the 2% cap. In
contrast, the Borough proposes to add nine steps to the salary guide for
members hired between January 1, 1999 and March 27, 2012 and to add eight
steps to the salary guide for members hired on or after March 28, 2012. The
added steps are said to be necessary in order to advance an officer to a higher

‘step but to render that step smaller in order to stay within the cap.

The second disagreement is over what individual officer salaries or
amounts should be included or excluded from salary cap calculations. By way of
example, there are sharp disagreements over salary calculations that concem
two police officers. These officers are Patrolman Pelligrino and former Patrolman
Albert. The parties have addressed these disputes in their written post-hearing

submissions. The PBA argues the following

33
With regard to the calculations on either the PBA proposed salary
guide or the employer's propused guide, there are fundamental
disagreements. The first disagreement is with Officer Pelligrino.
The employer has included him in their calculations for the two
percent cap and, more importantly, against the cap for his
movement through the salary guide. On December 31, 2014
Officer Pelligrino was in the police academy. He was not a police
officer or patrolman, nor was he a member of the PBA until after he
graduated the academy. While it is true that there was a salary
step for the Academy, he was not covered under the collective
bargaining agreement until after he had graduated the Academy.
Article |, Covered Personnel, states:

This Agreement shall apply to all full time Officers and
Patralmen of the Department employed by the Borough,
and the exception of the ranks of Chief, Captain, and
Lieutenant.

NJ.S.A. 34:13A4-16.7 states in relevant part:

b. An arbitrator shall not render any award pursuant to
section 3 of P.L.1977, c. 85(C.34:13A-16) which, in the
first year of the collective negotiation agreement
awarded by the arbitrator, increases base salary items
by more than 2.0 percent of the aggregate amount
expended by the public employer on base salary items
for_the members of the affected employee
organization _in_the twelve months immediately
preceding the expiration of the collective
negotiation agreement subject fo arbitration.

 

 

 

 

There is no question that Pellegrino was not a “member of the
affected employee organization” on December 31, 2014
Additionally, on the effective date of the new agreement, January 1,
2015, he was not a police officer, patrolman, or member of the
PBA, Finally, Pellegrino was treated differently than all of the
members of the PBA. When he was finally swom in as a police
officer and became a member of the bargaining unit, he was placed
on the first step of the salary guide. It was also at that time, April 4,
2016, that he was enrolled in the Police and Firemen’s Retirement
System (‘PFRS"). (U-25). Alll police officers are required to be
enrolled in the PFRS. Pellegrino was not, under the law, permitted
to be enrolled in the PFRS because he was not a police officer until
he completed the Academy. If he was a member of the bargaining
unit why did the employer change his salary. yet freeze everyone
else? The answer is simple. When he was sworn in as a police

34
officer, the Borough had to put him at the starting salary for police
officers. Pellegrino’s salary increases should not be part of the
money available under the wu percent salary cap.

The second issue concems the status of Officer Albert who has left
the police department and is no longer employed by the Borough.
Albert onfy worked for a few months in the beginning of 2015 and
then left to go work for another department. It is acknowledged that
the Commission has addressed this Issue, however, the facts of
this case are different from the cases addressed by PERC
previously, In Borough of New Milford and PBA Local 83, 38
NJPER 91116 (2012), the Commission wrote

 

Since an arbitrator, under the new law, is required to
project costs for the entirety of the duration of the award,
caleviation of purported savings resulting from
anticipated retirements, and for that matter added costs
due to replacement by hiring new staff or promoting
existing staff are all too speculative to be calculated at
the time of the award. The Commission believes that the
better model to achieve compliance with P.L. 2010 o
105 is to utilize the scattergram demonstrating the
placement on the guide of all of the employees in the
bargaining unit as of the end of the year preceding the
initiation of the new cantract, and to simply move those
employees forward through the newly awarded salary
scales and longevity entitiements.

In this case, Albert leaving the department is not speculative. It has
already occurred. He is no longer an employee of the Borough.
The arbitrator is mandated to project costs for the duration of the
award. Using a salary for a person who is not an employee does
not further that mandate. In fact, it would automatically create a
false projection. It would add approximately $180,600 of spending
that does not exist. In a relatively small unit, like this one, that
would completely change the projected costs. Finally, since the
PBA's proposal is done by providing salaries for the individual
officers, if it is necessary to put Albert on the list of officers, the PBA
proposes he gets no increases for the duration of the contract.

The Borough disagrees with the PBA’s method of calculation cancering

Officers Pelligrino and Albert and contends that its own methad of calculation is

35
more consistent with the statute and the PERC case law in regard to the proper

methad of calculation. The Borough submits:

The PBA does not calculate the cost of its demands in accordance
with applicable law. First, the PBA’s calculations are flawed
because the PBA failed to include Officer Albert's salary costs in
the successor contract term. See Exhibit 2. Officer Albert resigned
on July 13, 2015, six and one-half months into the successor
contract term. In accordance with New Milford, 38 NJPER at 340
and Borough of Ramsey, 39 NJPER 17, discussed above, which
directs that separations, retirements, and promotions that occur
during the successor contract term do not affect calculations,
Officer Albert's salary costs must be carried through the successor
contract term as if he remained employed. The PBA's decision to
omit Officer Albert's salary costs illegally frees up $51,804 for
salary increases for other officers.

Moreover, as discussed above, the PBA erred in failing to include
Officer Pellegrino in its calculations. See Exhibit 2. In contrast to
the PBA’s contention, the cost of Officer Pellegrino's base salary
must be included in the calculations for the successor contract term
because he was employed by the Borough as of December 31,
2014. The PBA offers no authority in support of its position that
Officer Pellegrino should not be included because he was in the
academy for his first six months of hire and thus not a “swom”
officer as of December 31, 2014. To the contrary, Officer
Pellegrino is a member of the PBA unit. His salary at the first step
of the salary guide, “Police Academy Basic Training,” was governed
by the salary guide in the PBA collective bargaining agreement and
his salary was paid by the Borough. It is irrelevant to the analysis
that Officer Pellegrino had not yet been sworn in as a police officer
as of December 31, 2014. Officer Pellegrino, the most junior
officer, receives the largest increases throughout the successor
contract term, His increases total 40.50% over three years (using
Borough figures with applicable mid-year salary increases) or
38.86% (using PBA figures). Omitting Officer Pellegrino frees up
$16,224 (using PBA figures) which falls within the 2.0% cap,
illegally making $16,224 available to increase the base salaries for
the other officers. See Exhibit 3.

The third main area of disagreement is over the amounts of salary that

each has attributed to the other party's proposal. The Borough calculates the

36
costs of the PBA’s proposal for 2015, 2016 and 2017 as 3.53%, 5.51% and
1.01% respectively, amounts that il alleges far exceed the cap. The PBA rejects
the Borough's calculations and submits that its own calculations, according to its
methodology, fall within the 2% statutory cap. As previously stated, the PBA also
rejects the manner in which the Borough has calculated its own proposals
because it views the Borough as having charged to the cap certain rollovers from

one year to the next, especially with regard to the first year.

Because | do not award either party's salary proposal, it is unnecessary to
engage in a detailed analysis as to the merits of each party's arguments that
center on disagreeing with the other party's method of calculation. | am duty
bound to render an award that does not exceed the 2% salary cap based upon
$1,852,333 on 2014 base salaries that yields a cap amount of $37,047 over the
course of the new contract plus a compounded amount for each successive
contract year after the initial contract year and to make those calculations based
upon the required methodology established by PERC. As | have previously
found, these amounts are $37,047 and $37,789 and $38,543 and $39,315 or a

total of $152,694. N.J.S.A. 34:134-16.7 permits the distribution of the aggregate

 

monetary value of the award in unequal annual percentages to be not greater

than the compounded value of a 2% increase per year.

In deciding the application of these amounts, | am bound by PERC case

law as set forth in Borough of New Milford, P.E.R.C. No. 2012-53, 38 NUPER 340

(| 116 2012) and Borough of Ramsey, P.E.R.C. No. 2012-60, 39 NUPER 17 (413
2012) and their progeny. A summary of arbitral authority was recently set forth in

State_of New Jersey and FOP Lodge 91, P.E.R.C. NO. 2016-11 (2016). In

 

pertinent part, it stated the following

P.L.2010, ¢.105 amended the interest arbitration law, imposing a
2% “Hard Cap” on annual base salary increases for arbitration
awards where the preceding collective negotiations agreement
(CNA) or award expired after December 31, 2010 through April 1,
2014. P.L.2014, 6.11, signed June 24, 2044 and retroactive to April
2, 2014, amended the interest arbitration law and extended the 2%
salary cap, along with other changes, to December 31, 2017.
NA.S.A. 34:13A-16.7 provides:

 

Definitions relative to police and fire arbitration;
limitation on awards.

a. As used in this section

“Base salary’ means the salary provided pursuant to
a salary guide or table and any amount provided
pursuant to a salary increment, including any amount
provided for longevity or length of service. It also shalt
include any other item agreed to by the parties, or any
other item that was included in the base salary as
understood by the parties in the prior contract. Base
salary shall not include non-salary economic issues,
pension and health and medical insurance costs

“Non-salary economic issues” means any economic
issue that is not included in the definition of base
salary.

». An arbitrator shall not render any award pursuant to
section 3 of P.L.1977, 6.85 (C.34:13A-16) which, in
the first year of the collective negotiation agreement
awarded by the arbitrator, increases base salary
items by more than 2.0 percent of the aggregate
amount expended by the public employer on base
salary items for the members of the affected
employee organization in the twelve months
immediatety preceding the expiration of the collective

38
negotiation agreement subject to arbitration. In each
subsequent year of the agreement awarded by the
arbitrator, base salary items shall nol be increased by
more than 2.0 percent of the aggregate amount
expended by the public employer on base salary
items for the members of the affected employee
organization in the immediately preceding year of the
agreement awarded by the arbitrator

The parties may agree, or the arbitrator may decide,
to distribute the aggregate monetary value of the
award over the term of the collective negotiation
agreement in unequal annual percentage increases,
which shall not be greater than the compounded
value of a 2.0 percent increase per year over the
corresponding length of the collective negotiation
agreement. An award of an arbitrator shall not include
base salary items and non-salary economic issues
which were not included in the prior collective
negotiations agreement.

In Borough of New Milford, P.E.R.C. No. 2012-53, 38 NJPER 340
(116 2012), we modified our review standard to include a
determination of whether the arbitrator established that the award
would not exceed the Hard Cap. ... [The Commission has
consistently authorized the arbitrator's approach to caloulating
increases in base salary items for those unit members remaining in
the unit after the base year. In New Milford, the Commission
endorsed the following method for “costing out’ an_ interest
arbitration award within the parameters of the 2% Hard Cap

Since an arbitrator, under the new law, is required to
project costs for the entirety of the duration of the
award, calculation of purported savings resulting from
anticipated retirements, and for that matter added
costs due to replacement by hiring new staff or
promoting existing staff are all too speculative to be
calculated at the time of the award. The Commission
believes that the better model to achieve compliance
with P.L. 2010 ¢ 105 is to utilize the scattergram
demonstrating the placement on the guide of all of the
employees ip the bargaining unit as of the end of the
year preceding the initiation of the new contract, and
io simply move those employees forward through the
newly awarded salary scales and __ longevity
entitlements. Thus, both reductions in costs resulting

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

39
from _retirements_or otherwise, as well_as any
increases in costs stemming from promotions or
additional new hires would not effect the costing out
of the award required by the new amendments to the

 

 

 

 

 

[New Milford at 344, emphasis added]

In Borough of Ramsey, P.E.R.C. No. 2012-60, 39 NJPER 17 (13
2012), we rejected the union's assertion that the arbitrator should
have taken into account a recent retirement and recent promotions
when projecting salary costs in the award, finding:

In New Milford, we determined that reductions in
costs resulting from retirements or otherwise, or
increases in costs stemming from promotions or
additional new hires, should not affect the costing out
of the award. N.J.S.A. 34:13a-16,7(b) speaks only to
establishing a baseline for the agaregate amount

expended by the public employer on base salary
items for the twelve months immediately preceding
the expiration of the collective negotiation agreement
subject to arbitration. The statute does not provide for
a majority representative to be credited with savings
that a public employer receives from any reduction in
costs, nor does it provide for the majority
fepresentative to be debited for any increased costs
the public employer assumes for promotions or other
costs associated with maintaining its workforce.

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

[Ramsey at 20, emphasis added]

| am bound by the methodology set forth in the above case law and will
apply it to the salary award. | next apply the evidence of this case to the
statutory criteria and the statutory salary cap. Initially, | note that the salary cap
does not in every case automatically determine what the salary result should be.
Its relevance and applicability in an arbitration proceeding is dependent on
whether the evidence points to the probability that, in the absence of the cap, an

amount that could exceed the cap could potentially be justified. In the instant

40
case, the PBA has produced credible evidence that supports an award that could
excced the cap. | need not proceed beyond the fact that normal movement on
the salary guide in accordance with its own terms, even without any increase to
the salary guides, would require funds that exceed the cap. Moreover, the
Borough does not contend that an award that expends funds up to the cap
limitation would compel it to exceed the tax cap levy of create adverse financial
impact on the Borough. The percentages that represent the cap is generally
consistent with the cost of living data. Even if such data exceeded the cap, the
data would be irrelevant because it could not support an award that exceeds the
cap. In short, an award less than what could lawfully be awarded would not
represent a reasonable determination of the salary issue. Further, comparability
evidence reflects interest arbitration awards in the County have resulted in salary
increases that are al the level of the statutory salary cap. Voluntary settlements
can exceed the cap but are of no evidentiary value given the requirements that
awarded salary increases cannot exceed the statutory salary cap. The most
compelling criteria are the interests and welfare of the public (N.J.S.A. 34:13A-

16g(1)), the lawful authority of the employer (N.J.S.A. 34:13A-16g(5)) and the

 

statutory restriction on the employer (N.J.S.A. 34:13A-16g(9)). These criteria
lead to the conclusion that salary increases are warranted but only to the extent
allowable by law. Accordingly, the salary award will be the maximum of what can
lawfully be awarded and thus, compel expenditures up to, but not in excess of,

the statutory salary cap.

at
Due to the requirements of the statutory salary cap, unit employees
cannot be moved through the salary guides even after they have met contractual
eligibility standards to do so, even if all of the steps on the salary guides were to
Temain frozen for four years. The obvious reason, as is known to the parties, is
that the costs of step movement alone exceed the amounts of funds that can be
awarded. Simply put, the large number of existing steps on the salary guide that
would require greater monies than what can be awarded to fund incremental

movements toward the maximum step. | next turn to the parties’ proposals.

| decline to award the Borough's proposal due to the significant increase in
the number of steps that the Borough would add to the salary guides that already
have a higher than average number of steps. The additional 9 and 8 steps to be
added to two of the existing salary schedules cannot be justified and would stand
in stark contrast to the number of steps contained in comparable salary
schedules, | also decline to award the PBA’s proposal because, as it is
calculated, the amounts necessary to fund the proposal would require this award
to exceed the statutory salary cap pursuant to the mandates set forth in
applicable case law, In particular, the PBA does not include Officer Peligrino in
its cost projections. It removes the costs of Officer Albert who separated from

employment during the 2016 contract year.

Officer Pelligrino’s salary of $41,752 for 2014 was determined by his

placement on the third salary schedule (Employees hired on or after March 28,

42
2012) at the Police Academy Basic Training step upon his September 25, 2014
date of hire. This salary schedule has a Year 1 step of $51,804 that Officer
Pelligrino moved to on March 25, 2014. Applicable case law requires that Officer
Pelligrino’s salary increases in 2015 beyond where he was placed on the
December 31, 2014 scattergram must be charged to the 2% cap. The PBA's
contention that he was net in the bargaining unit on January 1, 2016 is
understandable because it would avoid his 2015 increase to be charged to the
cap. However, this contention is inconsistent with the fact that his original
placement on the Police Academy Basic Training step was the result of the
negotiated salary schedule. it also runs counter to the applicable case law cited
above:

{To utilize the scattergram demonstrating the placement on the

guide of all of the employees in the bargaining unit as of the end of

the year preceding the initiation of the new contract, and to simply

move those employees forward through the newly awarded salary

scales and longevity entitlements.

Borough of New Milford and PBA Local 83, 38 NJPER [116 (2012)

 

The PBA’s contention with respect to Officer Albert Is also without merit. His
separation from employment during 2015 does not allow for a subtraction of his
$51,804 salary from the amounts the Borough was required to project to spend
due to his employment at $51,804 on the December 31, 2014 scattergram. As

stated in New Milford:

{Bloth reductions in costs resulting from retirements or otherwise,
as well as any increases in costs stemming from promotions or
additional new hires would not effect the costing out of the award

required by the new amendments to the Interest Arbitration Reform
Act.

Iso, Borough of Ramsey:

The statute does not provide for a majority representative to be
credited with savings that a public employer receives from any
reduction in costs, nor does it provide for the majority
representative to be debited for any increased costs the public
employer assumes for promotions or other costs associated with
maintaining its workforce.

Borough of Ramsey, P.E.R.C. No. 2012-60, 39 NJPER 17 (fi3
2012)

This methodology, as required by PERG case law, was applied by this arbitrator

in State_of New Jersey and New Jersey Law Enforcement Supervisors

 

 

This matter was appealed and affirmed by PERC [P.E.R.C. No. 2014-60] on

March

ion, PERC Dkt. No. 1A-2014-003, decided January 21, 2014. That case

Significantly, the aggregate amount of what is the maximum
allowable amount must be placed on the scattergram, or number of
employees, who are employed as of the last date of the contract
year of contract expiration on June 30, 2011. PERC then requires
the aggregate amount to be distributed to that scattergram over the
entire contract period as if all of the employees continued to be
employed without any impact from new hires or retirements.

10, 2014. In that decision, PERC held:

We affirm the arbitrator's salary award and find that his selection of
the State’s scattergram is consistent with our direction in New
Milford. We reject NJLESA's argument that the savings realized by
the State in FY 12 and 13 are to be credited to the unit. As we
indicated in New Milford, the base salary calculation may not
increase by more than 2% per year, or 6% in the aggregate for a
three year contract award, the amount expended by the employer
in the last year of the prior agreement, NJ.S.A. 34:13A-16.7(b)
Whether speculative or known, we again hold that any changes in
financial circumstances benefitting the employer or majority
representative are not contemplated by the statute or to be
considered by the arbitrator. See Borough of Ramsey (Holding that
the interest arbitration statute does not provide for a majority
Tepresentative to be credited with savings that a public employer
receives from any reduction in costs in the new contract years)
We also note that we have recently reversed the dynamic status
que doctrine as a matter of Commission policy and no longer
require employers to pay salary increments upon contract
expiration. See Atlantic County, P.E.R.C. No. 2014-40, __ NJPER

Accordingly, for 2015, the cap amount of $37,047 shall be awarded and
applied to the salaries and personnel included in the December 21, 2014
Scattergram that contained base salary costs of $1,762,514. Because Officer
Pelligrino was advanced to the Year 1 step at $51,804 on March 26, 2015, the
costs between his $41,752 salary on December 31, 2014 and his $51,804
prorated salary for 2015, the amount of $7,516 for year 2015 must be included
within the $37,047.? | have apportioned the remainder of the amount that can be

awarded in 2015 ($29,531) in the following manner and for the following reasons.

| have conciuded that a reasonable determination of the salary issue
should be one that does not expand the existing number of steps on the salary
schedules either in 2015 or in the remaining contract years and requires that

each unit employee remain on his or her step as of the December 31, 2014

others were frozen and there are no step cost increases associated with any other employee.

scatlergram throughout the contract duration. Although unit officers cannot
receive their full amount of step increases, the maintenance of the existing salary
structure will contribute to facilitating the parties’ future salary negotiations with or
without the existence of a statutory cap on salary increases. Because the
amounts that can be awarded cannot cover what the normal step increases
would have required, | find that a common method of distribution for ail unit
employees is the most reasonable and equitable approach towards the salary
increases. Accordingly, the remaining $29,531 shall be evenly distributed to the
steps occupied by employees on December 31, 2014 in equal dollar amounts to
each step on each of the three salary schedules by the addition of $1,555 to
each step effective January 1, 2015, To de othenwise could result in selective
and disproportionate increases being awarded to various unit employees to the

detriment of a majority of the others.

| award an identical method of distribution of salary cap monies for 2016,
2017 and 2018. This method of distribution would continue to award increases in
equal dollar amounts as the most reasonable and equitable method of
distribution. Each unit member, defined as all employees receiving a salary as
determined by their placement on a step set forth in any of the three existing
salary schedules as of December 31, 2014, shall receive $1,988 in 2016 by
adding this amount to the adjusted 2015 step, $2,028 in 2017 added to the
adjusted 2016 step and $2,069 in 2018 added to the adjusted 2017 step,

effective January 1 of each calendar year in 2016, 2017 and 2018. Each such

46
employee shall remain on his or her salary step that was occupied as of
December 31, 2014° throughout 2015, 2016, 2017 and 2018 and for future
Purposes retain his or her anniversary date based upon date of hire pursuant to

Articie IA). Accordingly, the salary award is as follows:

1. Officer Pelligrino shall advance to the Year One Step in 2015
upon his advancement to that step upon completion of the
Police Academy.

2. In 2015, each step in each of the three salary schedules
shall be increased by $1,555 effective and retroactive to
January 1, 2015. In 2016, 2017 and 2018, each step of the
three salary schedules shall be increased by $1,988 in 2016,
$2,028 in 2017 and $2,069 in 2018. All current employees
who were employed on the December 31, 2014 scattergram
shall receive the increases.

3. Each unit employee shall remain on his or her step as of the
December 31, 2014 scattergram throughout the contract
duration, except for Officer Pelligrino who shall remain at the
Year One Step.

4, Any modification to staffing during this contract term shall
result in employees being placed on the appropriate salary
schedules as modified.

Accordingly, and based upon ali of the above, | respectfully enter the

terms of this Award.

moved from the Academy Step after six months.
