Prior Contracts and Negotiations

The PBA and Borough have an expired contract that had a duration of one year from January
1, 2017 through December 31, 2017, (Exhibit J-1). The prior conteact was from January 1, 2013 through

December 31, 2016 (the “2013 CN

 

), Pursuant to the 2013 CNA, PBA members were to progress
on cither a five or six step salary scale, depending on whether he employee was hired before or after
January 1, 2014 wilh a lop-step in 2016 of $126,922. Regarding PBA members’ health insurance
contribution, the 2013 CNA provided that the Borough would be replacing the "Bollinger
Prescription Plan," with one provided by the New Jersey State Health Benefits Plan (“SHBP") and
provided that beginning in 2016 the employces would contribute a flat 15% of the cost of their

healtheare premiums,

POSITION OF THE PARTI

 

 

The Borough's Position

The Borough’s primary issue in this proceeding is health insurance contributions. The Borough
argues that the only reasonable determination that can be made in this proceeding is w require PBA
members to contribute to the cost of their health insurance premiums at the rates set forth in Chapler
78 (76.78), The Borough also argues makes several arguments in support of its Final Offer. The

Borough’s position is summarized below

1, The PBA members healtheare contribution must be returned to the levels set forth at NSA
52:14-17.28¢

The Borough first argues that ¢, 78 contributions for PBA members were not fully implemented

in accordance with NJS.A, 52:14-27.28d(c), and thus negotiations are preempted on this issue. Only

afer the statutorily mandated healtheare contributions of ¢, 78 were "fully implemented." the Borough

 

argues were employers and employees freeto resume negotiations over this subject matter. NLS.A
52:14-27.28e.

The Borough submits that the Borough and the PBA agreed to the 2013 CNA that provided for e.

 

78 level contributions and dropped those contribution levels to a flat 15% in 2016. The Borough suggests
that the mandatory four-year phase-in period-during which bargaining is preempted-should have lasted

until at least Judy 1, 2017.

Consequently, the Borough maintains that the PBA must by law return (0 their ¢, 78 contribution
lovel for at least another eighteen (18) months, as c. 78 makes clear that the obligation to complete the

§2:14-27.28e. The

  

four-year phase-in period survives even the sun-setting of the legislation, NALS

to
Borough argues that only then can the Parties re-enter negotiations on the issue of the PBAVS healtheare
conteibutions, with c. 78 levels representing the status quo at that time. Because the PBA members never

completed their statutorily-mandated four (4) years of contribution ate, 78 levels, the Borough argues

 

that the only "reasonable determination" that can be made on this issue is to return them to ¢. 78 levels s

 

that they can satisfy the obligation imposed upon them by the Legislature,

2. The Borough has implemented a pattern of settlement among its other bargaining units and non-
organized workforce that requires PBA members to retum to ¢.78 contribution levels

The Borough's second point argues that all of its employees other than the PBA make ¢.78

 

contributions and i( thus has pattera of settlement that requires PBA members to make ¢.78 contributions,
The Borough eites to PERC rules and regulations that speak to identifying “a pattern of salary and benefit

changes.” among an employer's bargaining unit

 

NLA.C. 19:16-5.14(c} and PERC”s recognition of the

importance of maintaining a pattern of settlement among bargaining units of the same employer.

The Borough submits that il endeavors to foster a harmonious relationship with all labor units by
promoting continuity in the benefits offered employee-wide. This patiern, the Borough argues, has been
accepted by all Borough employees other than the PBA members. The Borough submits that the

Borough’s four (4) other bargaining units CNAs with the: (1) F.M.B.A.; (2) Telecommunicator's Assoc;

 

 

(3) DPW Employees Assoc.; and (4) R.W.D.S.U. uniformly provide that Borough employees maintain

 

c. 78 level contributions (Exhibits E- § to E-8), TheBorough’s non-union workforce, il submils, continue
to contribute al this same rate. The Borough thus argues that il has implemented a pattern of settlement
with all bargaining units and employees wherein the ¢. 78 healtheare contribution levels are maintained

The Borough argues that the evidence in the record leads to the conclusion that failure to adhere

fo this patiern of setiement wilh relation to the PBA will serve to undermine the harmonious work

u
environment the Borough has worked so hard to cultivate, and which the pattern of settlement principle

is intended lo promote, The Borough argues that the PBA members are the highest compensated

 

gaining unit in the Borough, with lop step pay for patrol officers reaching $126,922 in base pay alone.
(Ex. J-L). The Borough submits that should the PBA be permitted lo remain at 15% contributions, a
patrolman at top step making $126.922 would be contibuting less than a Telecommunicator making
$71,222, who contributes 22-32% of the cost of his/her premium, depending on the type of coverage

The Borough argues that {his unjust resull will sow discontent among the other bargaining unils and non-

 

union workforce. thereby discouraging future settlements with those units, which runs directly counter

to PERC's policy considerations.

3. The Borough never agreed to reduce the PBA members healtheare contribution to 15% in
perpetuity.

 

The Borough maintains that nothing in Article VOL of the 2013 CNA grants the PBA lifetime

 

contributions at the [5% level. The Borough cites to Article VIII of the 2013 CNA that states that the

 

15% contribution level was to commence on January 1, 2016 and was only to hist “during this

 

Agreement.” The Borough argues that the plain language of the 2013 CNA dictates that the [5%
contribution fevel would only to last for the remainder of that conteact, ic, the calendar year 2016

The Borough contends that the context of the Borough's negotiations with the PBA supports this,
conclusion. Lipon expiration of the 2013 CNA, the Borough and the PBA agreed to the 2017 CNA, which
maintained the 15% healthcare contribution for one year in consideration of the PBA members not taking

an annual salary inerease (J-1). The Borough maintains that the record supports that the PBA member's

15% healtheare contribution was never intended to be permanemt but was for a fixed one-year period
that was later extended for another year as set forth in the plain text of the 2013 CNA and the 2017
CNA
4, The PBA’s demand that its healtheare contribution level remains at 15% is unprecedented in
comparison to similar departments
The Borough argues that a comparison lo other employves in similar municipalities supports the
Borough's position that the PBA mus| increase its healtheare contribution, Between the Borough and the
PBA, twenty-four (24) collective negotiations agreements concerning other police departments have
been admitted into evidence. The Borough submits that not a single department atTords its members
healtheare contributions at a level of 15% of the cost or lower. A majority of the contracts in
evidence, according to the Borough, contain clauses mandating that employces continue making
contributions as per ¢. 78. These municipalities inctude: (1) Englewood (E-13): (2) Cliffside Park
(E-14); (3) Fort Lee (E-15); (4) Garfield (E-17), (5) Ridgewood (£-12}; (6) Teaneck E-1): (7)
Wyckoff (E-9}; (8) Paramus (E-10); (9) Edgewater (P-20); (10) New Mitford (P- 21); (11) Midland
Park (P-23); (12) Wood-Ridge (P-28); and (13) Tenafly (P-25), The Borough submits that this geoup
includes the municipalities that the Borough argues are most comparable to Bergenfield in terms of size
and population, such as Englewood, Cliffside Park, Fort Lec, Paramus, and Ridgewood: as well as
neighboring municipalities Teaneck-which has a substantially larger population than Bergenficld-and

New Milford, The Borough points to Bergenfield's other avighbor, Dumont. that provides for bealtheare

 

contributions of 30% af the cost of the premiums.
 

The terms of the PBA‘s Final Proposal are barred by New Jersey Law and would inure a
substantial hardship upon Borough citizens

 

The Borough argues that the PBA's Final Otfer secks to receive more in base salary than in 2017,
but not give back anything of note-ineluding a reasonable healthcare contribution. The Borough argues
that the financial effeets of maintaining PBA members 15% healtheare contribution, step inereases, and

longevity, while sintultancously increasing base salaries by 1% would be devastating © Borough

taxpayers and is prohibited by law

The Borough first argues thal the 2% eap on base salary inereases precludes the Arbitrator from
granting the PBA's proposal. The Borough submits that for purposes of caleutating the 2% cap the starting
point ix the total base salary cost in 2017 of $5,365.227.65 (E-2 at page 13, the “Scattergram”). The
Borough submits that under the 2% hard cap the total spend in 2018 is thus eapped at $107,304.55. The
Borough submits that the Arbitrator's award in (his matter cannot inerease base salary items by more than
$107.304.55 during the calendar year 2018. The Borough further submits that the increase in PBA

nem:

 

is! salaries from step inereases and longevity equates 10 $248,815.26 in 2018 which have been
paid. Thus, the Borough argues there is no money under the cap for a 1.8% annual inerease and the

Arbitrator cannot grant such an inerease asa matter of kaw

 

The Borough also argues that the maintenance of the PBA members’ 15% healthcare contribution
will cost the Borough hundreds of thousands of dollars per year throughout the expected term of the next
conteact. During calendar year 2018, the Borough submits that PBA members’ healtheare premiums cost
the Borough a total of §1,1 70,336.00; of which the PBA members contributed $175,241.01, (E-2). Under
the ¢. 78 levels the Borough secks, it argues the PBA contribution during 2018 would have been

$382.912.76. The Borough submits that were the Arbitrator w grant the PBA their requested level of

i4
contribution, the Borough's taxpayers would be foreed to cover that remaining $207,671.75 difference

in 2018 and $223,607.59 in 2019 in costs. (E-2, page 12).

The Borough argues that the PBA’s proposed one-year contract with 15% healtheare contribution,
step movement, longevity inereases, and 1.8% annual salary increase, will eost the Bergenfield taxpayers
S688.173.90 in calendar year 2018. This amount is comprised of ¢ $248,815.26 in step and longevity

inercases; $112,280.86 in annual salary inercase; and $207,671.75 in added health insurance costs

 

fo the Borough as a result of the PBA's proposed 15% contribution level in comparison to ¢. 78

levels.

Based on those arguments and evidence, the Borough argues its Final Offer should be

awarded.

The PBA's Position

The PBA argues that it relies upon the statutes. the rules and applicable case law in defending the

(ypes of encroachments sought by the Borough in this proceeding,

The PBA argues that interest and welfare of the public is well served by the highly professional
and efficient members of the Bergenfield Police Department. They submit that the Bergenfield Police

Department is a full-service agency serving both a large residential population and a significant transient

 

population on a daily basis, The PBA argues that the “public” for this Police Department is not just the
twenty-six thousand seven hundred sixty-four (26,764) local residents but due to the Borough's
geography a significant transient population moving through the Borough throughout the day and

particularly during cush hours. The significance of this data they claim is that motor vehiele incidents
safety demands, accidents, and general duty all spike during these periods when one is serving the greater

population served by the Bergenfield Police Deparunem.

The PBA also cites to the Police Chief's Annual Report for the year 2017. The PBA notes that the
Chiet’s Report stressed with pride that this is an accredited Police Department from the New Jersey

Association of Chiels of Police and maintains

   

services to the public of the highest quality, The PB
further cites to the excellence in performance by the Bergenfield Police Department and its many
suceesses as echoed in the Council minutes. The PBA also notes that the cost of operations of the police
department have been reduced year-to-year, Citing the Police Chief's Annual Report, the PBA notes that

“the police administration stayed well within its budgetary allotment during 2017."

The PBA submits that the Borough has not maintained staffing or career path opportunities

 

consistent with the increases in activity and demands for service. The PBA submits that at the beginning
of 2018 there were less sworn Police Officers and supervisory positions on staff in the Bergenfield Police

Department than forty (40) years ago. The PBA argu

 

s that the reduction in supervisory positions alter
the career paths of a Bergenfield Police Officer alfeeting the ability to advanee financially. The PBA
argues that now that the career path has been diminished a wage increase is the only way for Police
Offivers to advance financially. Finally, the PBA argues that the cost of policing in Bergenfield has been

reduced because of the reduction in supervisory positions and that many of the senior patrol officers have

 

relired resulting in lesser paid step position police officers. The PBA argues that virtually all the people

 

in the steps are young officers who have been brought into the position to replace senior officers at the
top of the wage‘longevity guide whe bave retired. in sum, the PBA argues there is no question that the
public is well served by the exceptional level of professionalism and productivity ay well as cost efficient

services provided by the Bergentield Police Department

16
The PBA argues that an analysis of the prools s

 

bmitted consistent with criteria NLS.A. 34:13A-

 

16, ¢ (2) provides strong support for an award of the PBA’s Final Offer. The referenced statutory criteria
stresses comparisons and “conditions of employment of other employees performing the same or similar

services...", The PB/

 

submits (hat the proofs under this criterion illustrate support for an award of the

PBA Final Offer.

The PBA notes that there are three police contraets covering Bergenlield Police personnel; the
PBA. the Chief of Police and the Deputy Chief of Police. (P-7). The PBA submits that the Borough has

aclear and definitive pattern for contract resolution in the contracts with the Chief of Police and Deputy

 

Chief of Police. The PBA notes that both poliee contracts have a term through December 31, 2020
covering the same timeframe under consideration in this arbitration proceeding. The PBA further notes
that the terms set forth in the individual Articles of the Chief and Deputy Chief's contracts replicate the
same language in the PBA contract. The PBA also notes the fact that the contracts did not commence at

the same time but rather represent (vo separate yet near identical settlements on two separate dates in
different years.

The PBA argues that the two contracts guarantee the Chief and Deputy Chief with at least a two
percent (2%) wage increase for the term and guarantee the same fifteen (15%) pereent medical
contribution rates as the Borough challenges in this proceeding. The PBA notes that the Chiefs contract

guarantees a pay differemtial in the form of a rank differential and the Deputy Chief’s contract guarantees

 

a minimum of two percent (2%) for 2018 “in addition to raises” for that year, It would appear therefore
that whatever inerease is received by the eank-and-file will be enhanced by an additional wo percent (2%)

for the Deputy Chief for 2018.
With respect to medical insurance premiums for the two contracts, the PBA argue they both show

a pattern of settlement of 15%

 

health care contribution, In the ChiePs contract there is a specific provision

that the “Chief of Police shall contribute to her health insurance cost in an amount equal to fifteen pereent

 

(15%) of the total cost of health care benefits.” In the Deputy Chiefs contract. it provides that “The

Deputy Chief shail contribute to his health insurance cost in an amount equal to fificen percent (15%) of

 

the total cost of health care benefits.” The PBA maintain that a pattern of setdements within the
Bergenfield Police Departnient with respect to wages and medical contribution is clearly well-established

by the Governing Body of the Borough of Bergenfield

 

The PBA also argue that the Bergenfield Police Officer is not a highly paid officer using the
standard of Top Step Officer Base Pay but in fact is paid below average. They argue that the relative
position of the Bergenfield Police Officer is clearly below average among said Oflieer’s peers based upon
the evidenee presented by both parties in this proceeding. The PBA argues that even the clothing

allowance, a common form of reimbursement, and an issuc in this proceeding comparisons show. again

a level for the Bergenfield Officer which is below average of the parties’ contracts.

The PBA notes that the average rate of increase for 2017 was 1.86% when the Bergenfield PBA
took a zero (11.0%). In 2018 and thercafier they argue that the average rates of increase execed that which

is proposed by the PBA in this case.

With respect to the Chapter 78 premiutn contribution, the PBA notes that the change challenged
by the Borough occurred two contracts ago. In the most recent comtract, covering the single calendar year

2017, the PBA notes it took a freeze on pay rates with no inercases for the wage guide rates for a full year

just to continue the prior contract terms and to in part to offset the cost of step movement. The PBA
argues that a modification of Chapter 78 is in fact a tend which is growing in comparable municipalities

placed into evidence by the parties at hearing.

Based on the evidence in the record, the PBA argues its Final Offer must be awarded.

The Arbitrator must render an award based on the evidence on the revord in light of the statutory
ctiteria set forth above. The opinion and award must clearly address the criteria. It must include a
discussion of the evidence as it relates to the statutory criteria, the weight accorded to cach criterion and
the reason for the decision. The opinion and award must also explain whether any of the eriteria were

deemed to be irrelevant and why.

This Award will be

 

sued under concept of “conventional authority” pursuant to N.I.S.A,34:13A-

 

16d; and, N.J.A.C. 19:16-5.7(¢). Under conventional authority, an arbitrator's award ix not limited by

RASA.

 

3A-L6g(8) requires consideration of those factors ordinarily or traditionally
considered in the determination of wages, bencfits. and employment conditions. One such consideration

is that the party proposing a change in an employment condition bears the burden of justifying the

 

proposed change. The burden must be met by sufficient evidentiary support. No proposed iss
deemed presumptively valid in the absence of justification that is supported by credible evidence

Moreover, any decision to award or deny any individual issue in dispute, especially those having economic
impact, will inelude consideration as to the reasonableness of that individual issue in relation ta the terms
of the entire award. A decision on an individual issue will include consider the reasonableness of awarding that issue
in relation to the overall tems of the award, Indeed, while there may be merit to awarding or denying a single issue if

APPLICATION OF THE 16g CRITERIA

 

Public Interest Criteria 16g (1), (5). (6) & (9)

 

The Interest and Welfare of the Public, NLS.A. 34:13A-L6g(1); The

Lawful Authority of the Employer. N.LS.A, 34:13A-16a(5%: The Financial

Impact on the Governing Unit, Its Residence, The Limitations Inposed

Upon the Local Unis Property Tax Levy, and Taxpayers, NuLS.A

34:13A-|64(6); and Other Restrictions Imposed on the Employer, N.S
13A-16g(9)

   

The Public Interest Criteria is the most significant of all statutory factors to be considered and aa
Arbitrator must give due weight to the interest and welfare of the public when issuing an award. It is a
criterion that ineludes the financial impact of the awarded increases and the desirability of maintaining

employee morale for the Borough's police officers. Indeed. the criteria recognizes the interest of the publi

 

in knowing that its police department is stalfed by competent, dedicated personnel possessing good

working morale, and the interest of the public in avoiding higher taxcs and/or diminished services. As

 

Arbitrator Mastriani recognized in Point Pleasant and PBA Loval 106, 1A-2012-001 (September 19,

2011): “The interest and welfare of the public is catitled to the most weight because it is a criterion that

 

embraces many other factors and recognizes their interrelationships, ineluding the financial impact of an

 

caside Park and PBA Local 182, [A-

 

award on the governing body and taxpayers.” See also Borough of S

 

2012-022 (April 9, 2012) (“The interest and welfare of the public is not only a factor to be considered, it
is the factor to which the most weight must be given.”). “Arbitrators have reviewed the public interest as
encompassing the need for both fiseal responsibility and the compensation package required to maintain

ville and PBA Lo

   

an effective public safety department with high morale. 198, IA 2006-047

(November 5. 2008),
The interest and wellare of the public criterion also specifically includes limitations that have been,
imposed upon the employer by law. The statutory lintitations are specifically referenced in other eriteria

as well, including the lawful authority of the employer and the statutory restrietions upon the employer,

 

Since the enactment of the 2% hard cap. the statutory restrictions on the employer and lawful authority
are less relevant sinee the law requires the award be cap compliant, Here, acither party suggests that an

award will impact the lawlul authority of the employer of the statutory restrictions upon the employer so

these criteria, while considered, are not relevant to this proceeding.

Comparability 16g (2)

Comparison of the wages, salaries, hours, and conditions of employment
of the einployces involved in the arbitration proceedings with the wages
hours, and conditions of employment of other employces performing the
same or similar services and with other employees generally

   

fa) In private employment in general; provided, however, cach party
shail have the right to submit additional evidence for the arbitrator's
consideration

6) In public employment in general: provided, however, each party
shail have the righ( to submit additional evidence for the arbitrator's
consideration

® In public employment in the same or similar comparable
jurisdictions, as determined in accordance with section 5 of C.34:13A-
16. provided. however, that each party shall have the right to submit
additional evidence concerning the comparability of jurisdictions for
the arbitrator's consideration:

 

 

Intemal Comparison

Internal comparability ean be broken down into two general categories consisting of uniformed

and non-uniformed einployces within the s

 

‘me jurisdiction. An internal pattern of settlement in the same

 

jurisdiction involving both uniform and non-uniform employees is a significant factor in the determination

4
of an award because it usually corresponds to a public employer's budgetary capabilities and connotes

uniform treatment,

In this matter, the Borough submitted the following intemal conmparables: Bergenfield Police

 

Department Telecommunicator’s Association (January 1, 2018 through December 31. 2012)(E-5): Bergenfield

Association

 

Employce’s Association (January 1, 2015 to December 31, 2019 E-6); Bergenfield Fireman's

 

F.M.B.A. Local No. 65 (January 1, 2014 through December 31, 2018\E-7); and Local 108, RW.DS.U.,

UFCW (January 1, 2017 to December 31, 2020) (E-8). The PB:

 

submitted the Borough's contract with the

Chief of Police and Deputy Chief of Police (P-7) for its internal comparables.

 

ternal Comparison:
External comparability consists of comparisons between the group subject to the petition and other
public safety cmployces in similar jurisdictions, other public employees, generally, and private sector
comparisons. Io weighing salary statistics introduced by a party, | observe that PERC has promulgated

guidelines that may be broken dows into the following five general eategories

1. Geographic comparability, contiguous jurisdiction
of jurisdiction, and nature of cimploying entity:

 

r nearby, size

be

Socioeconomic considerations, basically a comparison of the type
of statistics found in the New Jersey Municipal Data Book and the
UCR, such as population density, cost of living, erime rate, violent
crime rate, lire incident and erime rate, ete.:

 

3. Finaneial considerations, such as the tax collection rate. state aid,
budget surpius, surplus history, eatios of tax revenue to total

revenue, ote:

 

4 Compensation‘benelits provided to employees of the comparison
group: and

5 Any other comparability considerations deemed relevant by
the arbitrator.
  

lary

Since 2011, comparability of percentage increases for interest arbitration is considered but has

 

been less relevant considering the 2% hard cap. Nevertheless, the Partics

 

submited the following

    

collective negotiations agreements as external comparables for consideration: Wyckolf (E-9); Paramus

(E-10}; Teaneck (E-1 1); Ridgewood (E-12); Englewood (E-13); Cliflside Park (E-14); Fort Lee (E-1

 

Lodi (E-16); Garfield (E-17); Saddle River (P-17); Cresskill (P-18); Englewood Citi's (P-19); Edgewater

(P-20}; New Milford (P-21. P-21A}; Teaneck (P-22);

 

Midland Pack (P-23); Wood-Ridge SOA (P-24)
Wood-Ridge SOA MOA (P-24A); Tenafly (P-25); Paramus (P-26) Fort Lee (P-27): Wood-Ridge (P-28):
East Rutherford (P-29); East Rutherford MOA (P-29A); and North Arlington (P-30). These external
comparables, while relevant, are given little weight considering the 2'% hard eap and the limitations

imposed on the arbitrator under the Act

According to the 2018 Biennial Report on the Police and Fire Interest Arbitration Reform Act

issued by PERC, the number of interest arbitration petitions decreased since the implementation of the

 

2% hard cap. Alter enactment of the law. there were twenty (20) petitions in 2015, nine (9) in 2016, and

 

twenty-nine (29) in 2017. The number of interest arbitration awards issucd over the last two years
remained low (8 in 2016: 4 in 2017). For the years 2008 through 2017, the average annual salary increases

in interest arbitration awards were: 2008-3.73%

 

2009-3.75%; 2010-2.88%; 2011-2.05%; 2012- 1.98%:

   

2013-1. 89%; 2014- 1.69% 2015-1.7 1%; 2016-1.94%; 2017-2.05%.

 

Data

 

Although an arbitrator must con:

 

er the general level of wage inereases in the private sector. an
arbitrator is not required to accord such statistics any particular weight, Indeed, unless a party presents

credible evidence comparing a private sector classification ( a public sector classification, the private

26
sector comparison will be considered but not given much weight, Here, neither party submitted evidence

on this criterion and it is afforded little weight,

On July 11, 2018, PERC published its most recent report of private sector wage changes based on
data compiled by the New Jersey Department of Labor and Workforee Development. For the fiscal year

period July 1, 2016 through June 30, 2017, according to PERC’s reporting, private sector wages increased

 

2. [Mi government wages inereased 1.9%: and total average annual wages inereased 2.1%, Therefore, the

PERC study of private sector wage inercases supports an award ofa 2% or maximum cap salary increase

ANALYSIS AND AWARD

The Final Oife

 

and Award in this proceeding are anal

  

sed below. The primary

 

issues for the Parties as articulated in their submissions are health ins utions and salaries.

Duration

The Borough has proposed a four-year term from January 1, 2018-December 31, 2021. Enote the
prior agreement was for a one-year termi (Je1) and the 2013 CNA was for a three-and-a-hall-year term

uly 1, 2013-December 31, 2016)(E-3). Lalso note that the internal comparables submitted by the Parties

 

have the following terms: Bergenfield Police Department Telecommumicator's

 

ation (January L, 2018
through December 31, 2021E-5): Bergenficld Employee’s Association (January 1, 2015 10 December 31,
2019\(E-6); Bergenfield Fireman's Association F.M.B.A. Local No. 65 (January 1, 2014 through December
31, 2018)E-7); and Local 108. R.W.D.S.U., UFCW (January |, 2017 to December 31, 2020) (E-8); Chief of

Pol

 

ember 31. 2020) and Deputy Chicl of Police (June 21, 2016 to December 31.

 

¢ (Scplember 201 5-De

 

2020) (P-7).

 

The PBA’s Final Offer is for a one-year term, January 1, 2018-December 31, 2018. The PBA
argues that a comparison of wages and terms and conditions of employment support its Final Offer on
duration, in part, “to avoid the harsh lintitations of the so-called “Hard Cap Law."" The PBA also
submitted the Chief of Poliee contract and Deputy Chief of Police Contract (P-7). The PBA argued that
the Borough has a clear and definitive pattern for conteact resolution in the contracts with the Chief of
Police and the Deputy Chief of Police. The PBA noted that both police contracts have a term through

December 31, 2020 covering the same timeframe under consideration in this arbitration proceeding. The
PBA also notes the fact that the contracts did not commence al the same Lime but rather represent two (2)

separate yet near identical settlements on two (2} separate dates in different years

Contract duration has been addressed in Interest Arbitration procecuings on « consistent basis. In

City of Asbury Park, and PBA Local 6, 36 NIPER © 126, it was noted that in deciding the issue of contract

 

duration, arbitrators must balance the nature of the employer's financial status. the need 0 provide
harmony and stability in the labor-management relationship, including the need to maintain the
department's increased effectiveness and productivity, and the desirability of maintaining the continuity

and stability of employment within the department.

Duration and the 2% cap were discussed in In the Matter af the Interest Arbitration between

 

County of Hudson and Hudson County Sheriff's Officers PBA Local 334, Docket No. IA-2014-004

 

(December 30, 2013) wherein Arbitrator Osborn placed a heavy emphasis on the principles espoused in

Borough of Midland Park and Midland Park PBA Local 79, Docket No. 1A-2013-013 (2013), and

 

concluded:

There was not much doubt that a longer conteaet provides a period of labor peace and
stability which is bencticial to the parties and furthers the public imerest ... However, both
in New Jersey and nationally, we are in a petiod of economic uncertainty. Indeed, it is
difficult t predict whether economic conditions will improve, deteriorate of remain stable.

Because of the extreme impact of the hard eap on my ability to award a salary benefits
package which would more appropriately reeognize the relevant statutory factors as set
forth immediately above, f reluctany conclude that the parties and the public imerest
would be better served if the parties were in a position to renegotiate the contract sooner
rather than iater

  

 

Arbitrator Osborn further noted that “A long-term freeze of members’ salary guide movement
an almost inevitable outcome of applying the hard cap over the five-year contract would be demoralizing
and would contribute to further attrition.”

An analysis of the evidence and arguments supports the reasonableness of both parties Final

 

Offers, For the Borough, a longer-term agreement provides for labor relations stability and some degree
30
of cost certainty (or future budgeting and financial planning. For the PBA, a one-year deal allows them

to avoid the harsh limitations of the so-called “Hard Cap Law.”

On the issue of the duration of the agreement, | gave great weight to the following: (i) the Borough
agecements are all multi-year agreements; (ii) the prior one-year agreement between the parties

nuaintained health insuranee at L

 

and provided a zero (0%) wage increase (J-1); and (ili) the Chief and

 

Deputy Chief's contracts expire December 31. 2020. f further note that the PBA has stressed that the
Chief and Deputy Chief's contract are the most comparable (0 the PBA and establish a pattern of

settlement,

19 avoid the harsh limitations of the so-called 2%

 

The PBA’s argument that its term proposal i
Hard Cap law” does not alone justify an immediate return to the bargaining table next week. This

argumnent way recently rejected by Arbitrator Mastriani, io The matter of Jersey City and Jersey City

 

Police Officers Benevolent Assoc:

 

ation (Docket No 1A-2017-012), wherein he dise

   

ed pattern and

duration and found:

The City has established that there is a pattern of settlement on the issue of contract
duration, Insulticient eredible evidence has been provided that would warrant a deviation from
the contract period that has been accepted by the City and all of its other publie safety bargaining
units. The speculation that a (vo-year contract expiring on December 31, 2018 might provide a
more attractive legal environment for which the POBA could engage in negotiations with the
City does not justify a deviation given the fact that all four public safety unions, including the
POBA, have had full opportunity to engage in negotiations under the existing Jaw and reach
agecements (hat extend over a common time period,

  

That said, the implications of the 2% hard cap on any step movement or s

 

lary inerease docs not
warrant the PBA being finaneially handeufied until end of 2021.

Based on the foregoing. [ use my authority under conventional arbitration and deny the Borough Final Olfer
and PBA Final Ofer and award a three-year agreetnent from January 1, 2018 to December 31. 2020. Awarding the

PBA proposal would foree the parties immediately back 10 the negotiations table within days of this Award as the
31
contract would be expiring, The Borough's four-year (erm and impact under the hard cap as discussed below would
be detrimental to PBA members and damage their morale, effectiveness and efficient performance of their mission. A

three-year term would not foroe the parties immediately back to the burgaining table and aligns with the expiration

 

of the Borough's agreement with Chief and Deputy Chief which the PBA expressed was the patiern of
settlement, [also note that the first year of the agreement under this award (2018) has passed. In 2018,
the step increase and longevity compensation have been paid and the 15% health care contributions were

continued. In the remaining two years of the contact awarded hereunder, the impact of the 2% bard cap

 

on step increases and longevity compensation (discussed below) and the Borough's desire wo inerease
medical insuranee contributions to eh. 78 levels (discussed below) further supports the duration awarded

herein.

The Borough's Final Offer on Salaries is

No step increases. All bargaining unit members still in step remain at the same step on the

Frozen Longevity payments during the term of the contract.

The PBA’s Final Offer is:

A 1.8% wage increase applied across-the-board to the salary schedules

In calculating the statutory 2% hard cap, the arbitrator is dependent upon the parties to provide

the necessary information. In City of Atlantic City. P.E.R.C. No. 2013-82, PERC addressed the issue

 

of the parties’ responsibilities (© produce accurate employee information sulficient to enable the

arbitrator t make the caleulations:
the parties: may not always agree on base salary information and calculations, ta
those circumstances, the arbitrator must make a determination based on the
evidence presented. . .. We [direct] that all public employers in interest arbitration
to provide arbitrators with the required base salary information and calculations.
including... (1) a list ofall unit employees, their base salary step in the last year of
the expired agreement, and their anniversary date of hire; (2) Cost of increments
and the specific date on which they are paid; (3} cost of any other base salary items
(longevity. educational costs, ete.) and the specific date on whieh they arc paid: and
(4) the total cost of all base salary items for the last year of the expired agreement

In that decision, PERC recommended that the arbitrator push the parties to submit the list before

the hearing and to reconcile aay disputes at the beginning of the hearing. Here, the Parties have cach

 

separately provided a “list.” The Borough has provided the Seattergram prepared by Kent Christaer,
Borough employee and CPA, that set Jorth the related data and employee information eailed for by the
statute, The Scattergram represents an analysis of the Borough’s salary expenditure for the calendar year

2017 for sworn Bergenticld police officers. The information underlying the Scattergram was yenerated

from the Borough's payroll system, Automatic Data Processing (ADP). The Scattergram retleets that ia

 

calendar year 2017 the Borough incurred a total base salary cost of $5.365.227.65. This number is
calculated by taking the total base salary cost of $5,742,448.65 and subtracting the Chief ($195.527.02)
and Deputy Chief ($181,693.98) who are not members of the bargaining unit. The PBA does not agree

with the calculations and presented its own table Chart No. 7 and Chart No. 8 ag well as P-31, a payroll

 

report from ADP dated as of January §, 2018. Chart No. 7 and P-31 submitted by the PBA reflects the
bargaining unit in 2018 and any longevity or senior officer differential in 2018. PBA Chart No. 8 sets
forth the composition of the bargaining unit by rank and provides salary, Joagevity and senior officer

The methodology tor the calculation of the 2% hard cap was set forth In Borough of New Miltord,

2012-53, 38 NJPER 340 (4116 2012}, where PERC adopted guiding y

arbitrator's responsibility in applying the 2% hard eap:

 

ciples concerning the

we must determine whether the arbitrator established (hat the award will

not increase base s

  

lary by more than 2% per contract year or 6

% in the

aggregate for a three-year contract award. In order for us to make that
determination, the arbitrator must state what the total base salary was for

the last year of the expired conteaet and
4

 

how the methodology as to bow
base salary was calculated. We understand (hat the parties may dispute the
actual base salary amount aed the arbitrator must make the determination
and explain what was included based on the evidence submitted by the

parties,

Next, the arbitrator must calculate the costs of the award to establish that

the award will not inerease the employer's base sal

 

lary costs in excess of 6%

in the aggregate. The statutory definition of base salary includes the costs

of the salary merements of unit members as they move through the ste

sof

 

the salary guide. Accordingly, the arbitrator must review the of the
einployces’ placement on the guide to determine the incremental costs in

addition to the acros

 

-the-board raises awarded. The arbitrator must then

 

determine the costs of any other economic benefit to the employees that
way ineluded in base salary, but at a minimum this ealculation must include
a determination of the employer's cost of longevity. Onee these ealeulations
are made, the arbitrator must make a final calculation that the total
economic award does not inerease the employer's costs for base salary by

more than

2% per conteact year, or 6

 

» in the aggregate

Since an arbitrator, under the new law, is required 1 project costs for
the entirety of the duration of the award, calculation of purported savings

resulting from anticipated retir

 

ments, and for that matter, added cost

duc to replacement by hiring new stalf or promoting existing staff are
all too speculative (o be calculated at the time of the award. The
Commission  belicves that the better mode! (o achieve compliance with
PLL. 2010 c, 105 is to utilize the seattergram demonstrating the
placement on the guide of aif of the cptoyces in the bargaining unit as
of the end of the year preceding the initiation of the new contract, and
to simply move those cmployces forward through the newly awarded

salary scales and longevity entitlements. Thu:

 

. both reductions in costs

resulting from retirements or otherwise, as well asany inereases in costs
stenming from promotions or additional new hires would not alfeet the
costing out of the award required by the new amendments to the Interest
Arbitration Reform Act

With regard to the first component of the calculation. the objective is to determine how much the

einployer actually paid unit employees for all components of base pay in the last year of the expired

agecement, The arbitrator

 

responsibility 10 pro-rate pay for new hires and mid- year terminations during

the base year was confirmed by PERC in Borough of Byram, P.E.R.C, No. 2013-72, (4/18/13). Once the

35
 

total base pay paid in the base year is determined, then the 2% is calculated. This is the maximum amount
that can be awarded in the first year of the new agreement. It must include amounts the employer will

expend (or in some cases, has already paid out) for step inereases and longevity increases.

The

 

hard salary eap sets a steiet fis

 

it on the amount of base salary that can be awarded. and

the Borough and PBA recognize this is what is required in this interest arbitration proceeding. The legal

 

framework. and PERC’s

 

nterpretation and application of the statute as to the methodology for calculating
wage inercases has been set forth in Borough of New Milford, P.E.R.C. No, 2012-53, 38 NIPER 340
(4/116 2012) and Borough of Ramsey, P.E.R.C. No. 2012-60, 39 NIPER 17 (83 2012) and their progeny
A summary of arbitral authority cited in those decisions was recently set forth in State of New Jersey and

FOP Lodge 91, PERC. NO. 2016-11 (2016).

  

The Borough claims it has adhered to PERC’s strict mandates in both calculating the

 

aping

 

off” point for the 2% calculation, as well as projecting the eusts of step movement and longevity increa:

throughout the proposed contraet period. {n this matter. the Borough maintains that the Seatte

 

mn sets
forth the actual base salary paid to all sworn law enforcement offivers for the calendar year 2017 as
$5,365,227.65, which is derived by deducting the salaries of the Chief and Deputy Chief who are not
members of the PBA from the total fisted on Seattergram, Accordingly, the Borough argues that the
total base salary in 2017 was $5,365,227.65, and 2% of this number equates to $107,304.85.

The Borough submits that the actual cost to the Borough of step and longevity inereases for the
PBA members in 2018 cost the Borough $248,815.26 and have been paid. Thus, the Borough argues that
the total base salary inereases for PBA members in 2018 from step and longevity contractual increases
equates to a 4.6% increase, and therefore the arbitrator cannot grant the PBA'S proposed 1.8% salary

increase on top of step and longevity movement
 

The Borough notes that its submi 2 pages 2-10) included costs andor cost

 

ion at the bearing (E

savings from retirements and/or promotions that should not be included in the 2% caleulation per New

 

Milford. The Borough maintains that inclusion of such information ieads to a more accurate understanding
of the financial cost of the proposed contract and thus included such information in E-2 for illustrative
purposes. The Borough instead relies upon the Scattergram and the financial models in Christner
Certification Exhibits A-D which do aot account for retirementspromotions subsequent to December 31.
2017 as per New Milford

The Borough submits that the PBA’s calculations are flawed. The Borough submits that the PBA’s

 

submission purports to identify the stepilongevity movement for its members in 2018 but suggests the

figures arc inaccurate. The Borough argues that PBA Chart No. 7 is not for December 31, 2017 as it has

  

PBA members at their 2018 positions‘salaries. The Borough also notes that Chart No, 8 overstates the
number of Licutenants and Sergeants on the payroll as of December 31, 2017, and by extension averstates
the amount of that salary cost in Chart No, 8 submitted by the PBA.

The PBA argues that the Borough has not maiotained staffing or carcer path opportunities
consistent with the inereases in activity and demands for serviee, The PBA argues that the reduction in
supervisory positions alter the career paths of a Bergenfield Police Officer and the only way t advanee

financially

 

$ through wage increases:

The PBA argues that the Borough's analysis of employee costs is flawed. The PBA argued the
Borough incorreetly performed a net cost comparison from 2017 to 2018, The PBA also argued that to
assess 2018 costs, the Borough mistakenly used the reciprocal of promotions made during the year 2017
which were paid for only part of the year. The PBA argues the same is true with respect to longevity and
senior olficer differential. The PBA argues that the correct methodology is 10 establish that rate being

paid at the end of December 31, 2017 and annualize it. That anqualized value is the basis for computation
7
going forward says the PBA. The PBA submits that the methodology used by the PBA in its presentation

 

is the proper interpretation and methodology consistent with the statute.

The evidence submitted by the partics on this criterion supports a Final Offer of an award at the

maximum amount allowable by law. The cost of living data and wage increases generally in the public

 

sector (1.9%) and in the private seetor (2.1%) data support such an award. The other criteria have been
considered and do not yield a different result, The overall compensation and benefits criterion reflect that
unit employees are reasonably compensated and have a 15% health care comribution, The record reflects

that a top step officer in 2016 could carn as much as $126,922.00. In addition, there are benefits including,

nior officer differentia

 

but not limited to, step inereases, Fongevity,

 

|, overlime. compensatory time, off
duty work, uniform allowance, vacations, holidays, health insurance with a 15% contribution, lite

insurance, dental insurance, college eredit compensation. and terminal leave.

The continuity and stability of employment criterion supports the maximum allowable award
under the 2% hard cap. As previously indicated. the record reflects that the terms of the award will not
compel the Borough to exceed the statutory litnitation on it such as the tax levy cap or the spending
appropriation cap, or that the amount of money equaling the cap would have adverse financial impact on

the Borough.

is of the record, | accept the Borough's Seattergram with a *

 

 

December 31, 2017 of $5,365,227.65 as the baseline tor caleulating the 2% hard cap. Applying the 2

 

formula equates to a permissible salary expense of $107,304.55 in 2018. In 2018, the step inereases have

 

been paid in the amount of $248,815.26. These inereases are withia the definition of base salary increases
and are chargeable (o the salary eap exceeding the cap by $141,310.71 in 2018. In 2019, the step increases
and longevity compensation amount to $189,024.48 and execed the permissible spend of $109.450.64 by
$79.573.84. These inereases are within the definition of base salary increases and are chargeable to the
salary cap leaving ao additional money to apply under the cap in 2019. In 2020, the step and longevity
compensation amount to $189,851.00 and execed the permissible spend of $111.639.65 by $78,211.35

leaving no additional money to apply under the cap in 2020, in 202 | the step and longevity compensation

amount t $206,874.00 and execed the permis

 

le spend of $113,672.00 by $93,202.00 Icaving no

additional money to apply under the cap in 2021

Based on the Seattergram, the total cost of step movements and longevity compensation over the
proposed four-year agreement is $834,564.74. Based on the Seattergram. the total permissible spend over

car term is $442,267.29 and under the PBY

    

the term of the Borough's proposed fo one-year term

has been exceeded. Over the three

 

ar term awarded hercin the total permissible spend is $328,394.84.

In 2018, the first-year under this Award, the step inereases and longevity compensation in the amount of
$248,815.26 have been paid leaving $79,579.58 permissible compensation to be awarded for 2019 and

2020,

As recognized by the PBA, “virtually all of the people in the steps presently are young officers
who have been brought in to the position to replace more senior officers at the top of the wage/longevity
guide who have retired.” The PBA also recognizes “the harsh limitations of the so-called “Hard Cap

Law" and the prior one-year contraet was

   

to “olset the cost of step movement.” The PBA understands

 

the impact of the hard cap on the guide and in the prior agreement bargained for a one-year contract with

 

0% increase and for continued healiheare al the 15% contribution, They argued for the same result here.

 

The application of the 2% hard cap formula over a diree-year term supports the following Award:
2018-0% salary increase, full step increases, senior olticer differential and longevity compensation
(which have been paid); 2019-0% salary inerease, step inereases October 1, 2019 ($44.75 | 83), senior
officer dilfercatial and longevity compensation in accordance with the Agecement in the amount of

$10,017.35; 2020-0% salary inerease, no step increases, senior officer differential and longevity increases

in accordance with the Agreement in the amount of $13,888.75.

 

The Borough's Final Offer of 0% salary increase, no step inereases (lrozen steps) and frozen
longevity compensation during the term of the agreement is not fully supported by the record and is not
awarded, In 2018, the first year under this Award, step movement and longevity compensation has been
paid which exceeded the 2% eap. Such compensation would aot be permitted to be awarded by an
arbitrator under the Act and would force an evaluation of those payments. By extending the term, the

2018 step payments and longevity compensation can be spread out over 2019 and 2020. The Award of

delayed step increase and longevity compensation in 2019 and longevity compensation in 2020 is

40
permissible under he cap and offsets the impact of the cap on the inability to award any salary inerease

 

Final Offer of 1.8!

 

or full step guide movement. The PB/ 4 salary increase applied across-the board to

 

the salary guide, however, execeds the 2% hard eap limitations. Based on a baseline base salary figure of
$5,365,227.65 in 2017, the 2% cap would allow for a spend of $107,304.55 in 2018. Step inereases and

longevity compensation ia 2018 total $248,815.26 exceeding the cap by $141,310.71. Besides the step

    

and longevity inereases, the PBA’s Final Offer in 2018 of 1.8% ($96,574.09) execeds the 2% cap

limitation. Due to the 2% hard cap, the PBA’s salary proposal is denied.
Accordingly, the Award on salary shall be:
2018 0% salary increase. lull step inereases, longevity and senior officer differential

2019 0% salary increase, step increases October 1, 2019, longevity compensation and senior
officer differential ia accordance with the terms of the Agreement,

The Borough's Final Offer proposes the following on the Health Care Contribution:

Heath Insuranee Contribution- 15% of the cost of premiums. This contribution level
is contingent upon agreement to the terms 1-4 above. in the event that an agecement
cannot be reached as to items 1-4 above, the Borough maintains that the bargaining
unit members must contribute at the levels set forth in N.IS.A. $2:14-17.28e.

a2
ay a health care contribution

 

Notwithstanding its Final Offer of 15% of the cost of premiums

conditioned on the wage and longevity issue, the Borough first suggests that ¢.78 contributions for PB.

   

members were not fully implemented in accordance with N_LS.A_ 52:14-27.28d(e), and thus negotiations

are preempted on this issue

The Borough submits that the Borough and the PBA agreed to the 2013 CNA that provided for e.

 

78 level contributions but dropped those contribution levels to a flat 15% in calendar year 2016, The
Borough maintains that dre PBA must by law return to their ¢. 78 contribution levels as PBA members
never completed their statutorily mandated four (4) years of contribution at ¢. 78 levels. The Borough's

second point argues that all its employces other than the PBA make ¢.78 contributions and it thus has

patiern of settlement that requires PBA members to make ¢.78 contributions. The Borough cites to PERC

 

rules and regulations that speak 10 ideatilying "a pattern of salary and benefit changes,” among an
employer's bargaining units. MAAC. 19:46-5.14{c) and PERC’s recognition of the importance of
maintaining a pattern of settlement among bargaining units of the same employer. This pattern, the

Borough argues, has been accepted by all Borough employces other than the PBA members, The

 

Borough submits that the Borough's four (4) other bargaining units CNAs with the: (1) F.M.B.A.; (2)
Telecommunicator's Assoc.: (3) DPW Employees Assoc.; and (4) R.W.D.S.U. uniformly provide
that Borough employees maintain the same level of contribution as they had during the c. 78

period. E- 5 to E-8. TheBorough's non-union workforce, it submits, continue to contribute at this

 

same rate. The Borough thus argucs that it has implemented a pattern of settlement with all

bargaining units and employees wherein the c. 78 healthcare contribution levels are maintained.

43
The Borough argues that the evidence in the record feads to the conclusion that faiture to
adhere 10 this pattern of settlement with the PBA will serve to undermine the harmonious work

environment the Borough hi

 

worked so hard (0 cultivate, and which the pattern of settlement
principle is intended to promote. The Borough argues that the PBA members are the highest
compensated bargaining unit in the Borough, with top step pay for patrol officers reaching $ 126.922

in base pay alone. (J-1), The Borough s

 

sbmits that should the PBA be permitted to remain at [5%

contributions, a patrobman at top step making $126,922 would be contributing less than a

 

Telecommunicator making $71,222, who contributes 22-32% of the cost of his/her premium,

depending on the type of coverage. N.LS.A. 5

  

14-27.28c. The Borough argues that this unjust result
will sow discontent among the other bargaining units and non-union workforee, thereby discouraging

future setitements with those units, which runs directly counter to PERC’s policy considerations.

 

Cty. 266 NL. Super. S01, 519 (App. Div. 1993), certif. denied, 137 NI 341

(1994),

The Borough maintains that nothing in Article VIII of the 2013

 

grants the PBA lifetime

contributions at the 1

 

level. The Borough cites 10 Article VIII of the 2013 CNA eaplicitly that states
that the 15% contribution level was to commence on January 1, 2016 and was only to last "during this
Agreement.” The Borough argues that the plain language of the 2013 CNA dictates that the 15%
conteibution level would only to fast for the remainder of that contract, i.e., the calendar year 2016, The
Borough maintains that the record supports that the PBA inember's 15% healtheare contribution was
never intended 10 be permanent but was for a fixed one-year period that was later extended for

another year as sct forth in the plain text of the 2013 CNA and the 2017 CNA, (J-1 & E-3).

44
The Borough also argues thal a comparison to olher employees in similar municipalities supports
the Borough's position that the PBA must inereasc its healthcare contribution. The Borough submits that
based on the external comparables in the record not a single department affords its members healthcare

contributions al a level of 15% of the cost or lower, The vast majority ef the contracts in evidence

 

according the Borough, contain clauses mandating that employees continue making contributions ax

per ¢. 78, These municipalities include: (1} Englewood (E-13): (2) Cliffside Park (E-14); (3) Fort Lee

 

(E-15); (4) Garfield (2-17); (8) Ridgewood (E-12); (6) Teaneck (E-11); (7) Wyckoff (E-9): (8) Pararmus
(E-10); (9) Edgewater (P-20); (10) New Milford (P- 21); (11) Midhand Park (P-23); (12) Wood-Ridge
(P-28}; and (13) Tenafly ( P-25), This group includes the municipalities that the Borough argues are

most comparable 10 Bergenfield in termns of size and population, such ay Englewood, Cliffside Park, Fort

 

Lee, Paramus, and Ridgewood: as well as neighboring municipalities Teaneck-which has a substantially
larger population than Bergenfield-and New Milford. The Borough points to Bergenfield’ other acighbor,

Dumont, that provides for healtheare contributions of 30% of the cost of the premiums.

The PBA argues that interest and welfare of the public is well served by the exceptional level of

 

professionalism and productivity as well as cost efficient services provided by the Bergenfield Police

Department. The PBA argu

 

that an analysis of the prools submitted consistent with criteria NJ

s Final Offer, The PBA cites to the Chief

   

34:13A-16, g(2) provides strong support for aa award of the PB,
of Police and the Deputy Chief of Police contracts and submits that the Borough has a clear and definitive
patiern for contract resolution. The PBA argues that the two contracts guarantee those Police Officers the
same medical contribution of fifteen percent (15%). In the Chief's eontraet there is a specilic provision
that the “Chief of Police shal! coateibute to hee health insurance cost in an amount equal to fifteen percent

(15%) of the total cost of health care benefits.” The PBA notes that the Deputy Chicf’s contract provides

that “The Deputy Chief shall contribute to his health insurance cost in an amount equal w fifteen pereent

4S
 

(15%) of the total cost of health care benefits.” The PBA submits that the Governing Body has established
a continuation in a multi-year contract of the fifteen percent (15%) medical contribution provision, The
PBA argues that the pattern of settlements within the Bergenfield Poliee Department with respect to wages

and medical contribution is clearly well-cstablished by the Governing Body of the Borough of

Bergenfield,

The PBA argues (hat the Borough negotiated modifications of Chapter 78 premium contributions
vo contracts ago. In the most recent contract, covering the single ealendar year 2017, the PBA notes it
took a freeze on pay rates with no inereases for a full year just to continue the prior conteaet terms and in
part to offset the cost of step movement, The PBA submits that the modification of ch. 78 contributions

is.a trend which is growing in comparable municipalities placed into evideace by the parties at heating.

Regarding the ch. 78 contribution issue, it is important to note that the 2013 negotiated CNA

provided for a reduction trom ch. 78 contribution levels to 15% of the cost of premiums. The 2017 CN,

 

  

continued the contribution levels at 15%. Inthe contest of these proceedings, ay noted above. the Borough

has offered [8% of the cost of premiums asa heaith care contribution. To the extent the Borough suggests

 

 

the issue is preempted from consideration, I note dat N.J.A.C. 19:16-5.5 provides for expedited seope of

negotiations determinations in interest arbitration proceedings and the failure to file a request Lor a seope

 

determination “shall be deemed a waiver of the negotiability objection.” NAC. 19:16-5.5(¢). Ltherefore

will not address (he ch.78 contribution issue other than in the contest of the Borough's Final Offer to

   

return to ch. 78 levels with respect to the term, wage and longevity issues in this proceeding discussed

above.

Based on the evidence and submissions of the Parties, I find that the application of the 16g criteria

support an award of the Borough’s Final Offer of Fifteen (15%) percent of the cost of premiums as the

 

46
health care contribution. While the Borough argued ch. 78 and the return to ch.78 contribution levels, its
Final Offer was [5% of the cost of premiums conditioned upon the term, wages and longevity. The impact
of the 2% hard cap on my ability t award a salary and health benefits package whieh would more

appropriately recognize and analyze the relevant statutory factors supports the award of the continuation

 

of the [5% of premium eost health care contribution sought by the Borough.

  

The interest and welfare of the public supports the continuation of the 15% of premium health
care contribution. While it may cost the Borough more than ch.78 levels, continuing the 15% of premium
health care contribution will help offset the impact of the 2% hard cap on the PBA members inability to
see any meaninglul inerease in salary or longevity in 2019 and 2020. The comparability with the Chief
and Deputy Chief contracts that provide for the 15% of premium health eare contribution is also given

great weight in awarding the Borough's Final Offer. The overall compensation supports the award as the

fiscal limitations imposed by the 2% hard eap and i

 

impact on this bargaining unit cannot be ignored
The lawful authority, financial inypact on the governing unit, its residents and taxpayers, and statutory
restrictions on the employer are not impacted duc to the 2% hard cap. The contiauity and stability of

employment also supports an award of the Borough's Final Oller of 15

 

of premium health care

  

conteibution to offset the impact on salaries under the 2% hard cap formula, As noted by Arbitrator Osborn
in Hudson County citing Midland Park, “A long-term freeze of members’ salary guide movement an
almost inevitable outcome of applying the hard cap over the five-year contract would be demoralizing

and would contribute to further attrition.” In that vein. L note that the term of three-years awarded herein

lessens the impact of a treeze of members

    

salary guide movement andallows

 

the Borough the opportunity

to return to the bargaining table in 2020 and seek a return to ch. 78 contribution levels.
