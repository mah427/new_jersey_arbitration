1 PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND
On September 23, 2015, the State of New Jersey Division of State Police

(‘Division’) filed a Petition to Initiate Compulsory Interest Arbitration (“Petition”) with New
Jersey's Public Employment Relations Commission ("PERC’). By filing the Petition, the
Division asked PERC to appoint an Interest Arbitrator pursuant to the Police and Fire
Interest Arbitration Reform Act, N.J.S.A. 34:13-16(e)(1) to make an award concerning a
Successor collective negotiation agreement. (“CNA”) with the State Troopers Fraternal
Association of New Jersey, Inc. (‘STFA" or Union”). On November 2, 2015, | was
appointed to serve as Interest Arbitrator. The statute requires that an award be issued
within ninety (90) day of my appointment

Pursuant to N.J.S.A. 34:13-16(b)(3), on November 24, 2015, | conducted a
mediation session with the parties in order to “effect a voluntary resolution of the
impasse.” At that session, it was determined that the impasse should proceed to interest
arbitration. Pursuant to a stipulation entered into by both parties and approved by me, the
parties reserved the right to amend their final offers throughout the proceeding. |
conducted arbitration hearings on November 30, 2015, December 2, 2015, December 8,
2015 and January 4, 2016’. The hearings were held at the School of Management and
Labor Relations at Rutgers University, 50 Labor Center Way, New Brunswick, New
Jersey. The Division and the STFA submitted documentary evidence and testimony.

Sergeant James Kiernan (“Kiernan”), President of the NCOA, Michelle LaBruno

 

* Simultaneously, | was also appointed as the Interest Arbitrator concerning a successor CNA for the New
Jersey State Troopers Non-Commissioned Officers Association ('NCOA'). That Interest Arbitration
Proceeding bears index number: !A-2016-007. The evidence in both the NCOA and STFA arbitrations
overlapped. In order to expedite both matters, the parties agreed to present evidence concerning both
bargaining units in the same hearing. However, these two cases were not consolidated and separate but
Necessarily overlapping awards were issued
(‘LaBruno), CPA of the firm of O'Connor Davies, detective Segeant Stephen
Urbanski,(‘Urbanski"), Trooper Michael Zanyor (‘Zaynor’), Trooper Christopher Burgos
and Sergeant Frank Serratore (‘Serratorre’) testified on behalf of the Union. Michael Dee
(‘Dee”), Director of the Governor's Office ‘of Employee Relations, Major Mark A
Wondrack ("Wondrack"), and Acting Director of the State of New Jersey Office of
Management and Budget David Ridolfino (‘Ridolfino’) testified on behalf of the Division.

firm of Loccke, Correia & Bukosky represented the Union. Steven W. Suflas, Esq., William
K. Kennedy Il, Esq, and Bradley J. Betack, Esq. represented the Division
Both parties were afforded a full opportunity to examine and cross-examine
witnesses, submit evidence, and present arguments in support of their respective
positions. The evidence adduced and the positions and arguments set forth by the parties
have been fully considered in preparation and issuance of this Interest Arbitration
Decision and Award.
th STIPULATIONS OF THE PARTIES
The Parties were unable to reach any stipulations conceming the substantive
issues in this proceeding.

IV. REVISED STATUTORY CRITERIA

This proceeding is governed by the Police and Fire Public Interest
Arbitration Reform Act, N.J.S.A., 34:13-14. As such, | am prohibited from issuing
an award:

Which, in the first year of the collective negotiations
agreement awarded by the arbitrator, increases base salary
items by more than 2.0 percent of the aggregate amount
expended by the public employer on base salary items for the
numbers of the affected employee organization in the twelve
months immediately preceding the expiration of the collective
negotiations agreement subject to arbitration. In each
subsequent year of the agreement awarded by the arbitrator,
base salary items shall not be increased by more than 2.0
percent of the aggregate amount expended by the public
employer on base salary items for the numbers of the affected
employee organization in the immediate preceding year of the
agreement awarded by the arbitrator.

The ... arbitrator may decide to distribute the aggregate
monetary value of the award over the term of the collective
negotiations agreement in unequal annual increases, which
shall not be greater than the compounded value of a 2.0
percent increase per year over the corresponding length of
the collective negotiations agreement

NJ.S.A. 34:13A-16.7(b).

The revised statute defines “base salary” as:

The salary provided pursuant to a salary guide or table and
any amount provided pursuant to a salary increment,
including any amount provided for longevity or length of
service. It also shall include any other item agreed to by the
parties, or any other item that was included in the base
salary as understood by the parties in the prior contract.
Base salary shall not include non-salary economic issues,
pension and health and medical insurance costs.

N.J.S.A. 34:13A-16.7(a)
In rendering my award, | am also bound to apply the criteria set forth at N.v.S.A.
34:13-16(g) which provides:

The arbitrator shall decide the dispute based on a reasonable
determination of the issues giving due weight to those factors
listed below that are judged relevant for the resolution of the
specific dispute. In the award, the arbitrator or panel of
arbitrators shall indicate which of the factors are deemed
relevant, satisfactorily explain why the others are not relevant,
and provide an analysis of the evidence on each relevant
factor; provided, however, that in every interest arbitration
proceeding the parties shall introduce evidence regarding the
factor set forth in paragraph (6) of this subsection and the
arbitrator shall analyze and consider the factor set forth in
paragraph (6) of this subsection in any award:

(1) The interests and welfare of the public. Among the items the
arbitrator shall assess when considering this factor are the
limitations imposed upon the employer by P.L.1976, c.68 (C.
40A:4-45.1 et seq.).

(2) Comparison of the wages, salaries, hours and conditions of
employment of the employees involved in the arbitration
proceedings with the wages, hours, and conditions of

party shall have the right to submit additional evidence for the
arbitrator's consideration.

party shall have the right to submit additional evidence for the
arbitrator's consideration.

(C) In public employment in the same or similar comparable
jurisdictions, as determined in accordance with section 5 of

Vv. BACKGROUND

The Division and the STFA have submitted contract disputes to interest arbitration
in the past. On September 21, 2011, Arbitrator James Mastriani issued an Interest
Arbitration Decision and Award (“Mastriani Award”) in a consolidated proceeding covering
the STFA (IA -2010-039) as well as the State Troopers Non-Commissioned Officers
Association ("STFA")(IA-2010-0-40) and the State Troopers Superior Officers Association
(‘STSOA’) (1A-2010-041). (NCOA Ex. 4). Under the terms of the Mastriani Award, all
three contracts including the STFA CNA (NCOA Ex. 2), expired on June 30, 2012. The
parties to this proceeding have been working without a successor CNA since that date.
The Division and the STFA engaged in collective bargaining negotiations between August
5, 2013 and March 2014. Eventually, the parties agreed to engage in fact-finding before
Fact Finder Joel Weissblatt. On August 24, 2015, the Division suspended the fact-finding
process. Simultaneously, the Division announced that incremental payments under the
CNA were stopped effective with Pay Period 20 of that year. (STFA Ex. 6)

In the Mastriani Award, and confirmed in the proceeding before me it is clear that

the Division employs some of the most highly trained police officers in the United States.
Both parties are in agreement regarding the skills and competence of the members of the
Division.

a) The Division's Position on the New Jersey Economy and the State's Ability to
Fund a Wage Increase

As Acting Director Ridolfino testified, New Jersey faces a number of structural
challenges conceming its economy. Mr. Ridolfino stated that New Jersey's
unemployment rate is 5.4% and is higher than the national average, and is higher than
other states in the Northeast. (Tr. 12/8 at 7-8)°. In addition, Mr. Ridolfino testified that the
fund balance of 2%, or the difference between a state's assets and liabilities, is low. Mr.
Ridolfino noted that rating agencies, such as Moody's and Standard and Poor's, prefer to
see a fund balance of 5% and that anything less than 5% indicates a problem with a
states’ liquidity and its ability to borrow funds. (Tr. 12/8 at 25). Mr. Ridolfino also testified
that non-discretionary expenditures comprise the largest and growing portion of the
budget. These non-discretionary items include pension contributions, health benefits and
debt service. In Fiscal Year 2016 (“FY16") the amount appropriated for these items
increased from $7.58 billion to 8.51 billion. (D 13 at 11, Tr. 12/8 at 29-31).

b) The STFA’s Position on the New Jersey Economy and the State's Ability to

Fund a Wage Increase

The STFA paints a rosier picture of the New Jersey economy. The STFA notes

that since 2010, the State's unemployment rate has fallen by thirty-six percent (36%).

(NCOA Ex.11A (Budget Summary) at 5). In addition, the STFA notes that the cost of

* References to the transcript shall be denoted as (Tr. Month/date at p.). However, for the January 4,
2016 hearing, there were two transcripts one represented the conclusion of the NCOA case and one
represented the conclusion of the STFA case. Those transcripts will be denoted as (Tr. NCOA
Month/date at p) and (Tr. STFA month/date at p). References to Division exhibits shall be denoted as (D
#), References to Association exhibits shall be denoted as (NCOA #) or (STFA #)

13
running the Executive Branch, which the Division is a part of, comprises only ten percent
(10%) of the entire budget. (NCOA Ex.11A (Budget Summary) at 7). The NCOA notes
that the costs of running the Division are offset by revenues received from the New Jersey
Toll Road Authority including the New Jersey Turnpike, the Garden State Parkway, the
Atlantic City Expressway, the Delaware River Joint Toll Bridge Commission and other
entities. (NCOA Ex. 9).

Sergeant Kiernan testified that between April 2010 and April 2015, the number of
sworn officers was reduced from three thousand and fourteen (3,014) to two thousand six
hundred and fifty-six (2,656). (Tr. 11/30 at 43). In addition, Buck Consultants, the State
Police Retirement System of New Jersey's actuary, reports that between 2010 and 2014
the number of participants in the retirement system declined from three thousand and
thirty (3,030) to twenty-five hundred and twenty-two (2,522)*. (NCOA Ex. 7A at p. 5).

As a result of the application of Chapter 78 requiring increased contributions for
health insurance and participation in the retirement system, Trooper and STFA President
Burgos testified that his overall take home pay was significantly reduced because he is
presently paying twenty-nine percent (29%) of his health insurance premium, and an
additional one and half percent (1.5%) of his pension contribution. (STFA Tr. 1/4 at 84).

VI. THE PARTIES DISCUSSION OF COMPETING WAGE PROPOSALS

As noted above, pursuant to N.J.S.A. 34:13-16(g), Arbitrators are required (if
possible and relevant) to apply the statutory criteria to the award.

In analyzing the statutory criteria in support of its position, the STFA emphasizes

the “quality, competence, success [and] professionalism” of the State Police. The STFA

“The Report also states that between 2013 and 2014 the number of participants increased by 41
14
notes that the Division has complete jurisdiction to enforce all laws throughout the State.
In addition, the Division is the primary police force in towns that have no Police
Department. The STFA contends that the “State Police services are one of the finest
points of government service.”

The STFA also notes that other jurisdictions in the Northeast have engaged in
collective bargaining. The STFA introduced into evidence and provided a chart of recent
settlements and interest arbitration awards entitled “Northeast State Police Settlements
and Awards.” The information by the NCOA shows that in states adjoining and
neighboring New Jersey, for the period 2012-2016, members of those State Police
bargaining units either received or can be expected to receive wage increases averaging
over 2%. The chart below provides recent settlements among state police forces in

neighboring states:

AVERAGE 2.33% | 1.875% | 2.425%| 258% | 2.75% |

 

 

 

In addition to noting the wage increases provided in state other than New Jersey,

the STFA also points out that certain states have other benefits that enhance state trooper

 

© The Rhode Island contract was the only contract imposed by an interest arbitrator. The other contracts
were concluded pursuant to collective bargaining,

15
salaries. New York State Troopers have enhanced area differentials and hazardous duty
pay. The STFA notes that employee contributions for health and retirement are
Significantly less for New York State Troopers than for New Jersey State Troopers. (STFA
Brief at 24-25, NCOA Ex. 49)

In addition, in support of its position, the STFA introduced into evidence recent
collective bargaining agreements and interest arbitration awards from the join state
Waterfront Commission of New York Harbor. The STFA notes that the Detectives
Endowment Association and the Waterfront Commission of New York Harbor reached an
agreement which included a 2.56% wage increase, including increments. (NCOA Ex. 26),
'n addition, Arbitrator Phillip Maier (‘Maier’) recently issued an interest arbitration award
concerning the Waterfront Commission of New York Harbor and AFSCME Local 1000 in
which the arbitrator awarded a 0% increase for 2012; 1.5% increase for 2013; 1.5%
increase for 2014; and 2.0% increase for 2015. Arbitrator Maier awarded other salary
enhancements, including longevity increases.

The STFA points to a recent interest arbitration award concerning New Jersey
Transit Police Supervisors: P.E.R.C. Award Docket No.: IA-2016-002. In this case the
arbitrator awarded six years of increases for the period 2011 to 2016 ranging from 1.5%
to 1.75%.

By contrast, the Division points to other law enforcement units within the State. In
2011-2016, the State reached voluntary agreements with five bargaining units and was a
Party to one concluded interest arbitration proceeding. The Division offered the following
chart to show that these settlements were well within the statutory 2% Hard Cap and were

settled for less than the contracts relied upon by the STFA:

The Division also argues that comparisons to non-New Jersey state jurisdictions
are irrelevant, because those states do not have the same statutory restrictions as exist
in New Jersey.

The Division and the STFA have been unable to agree on a number of fundamental
issues concerning the appropriate criteria for determining changes in salary for members

of the STFA bargaining unit

® Plus an $800 lump sum not added to base for officers at the top of the scale on May 31, 2012
7 Plus a $500 lump sum in November 2014.
® Plus a 0.75% increase and an $800 lump sum to “Principle Investigators’ at the top of the scale as of
June 30, 2014.
SIN-4)
1© SLEU Majors are “single salary’ employees with no incremental increases. However, they did receive
two additional bonuses that were not added to base salary and, that, added together, represented 2.25%
of the Major's single rate salary

*Footnotes 7-11 were contained in the Division's brief.

17
The basic framework for determining the mathematical criteria for awarding a
change in salary is found in Borough of New Milford, P.E.R.C. No. 2012-53, 38 NJPER
340 (JJ 116 2012). In this case, PERC provided a road map for arbitrators applying the
2% Hard Cap at issue in this proceeding:

Since an arbitrator, under the new law is required to project
costs for the entirety of the duration of the award, calculation
of purported savings resulting from anticipated retirements,
and for that matter added costs due to the replacement by
hiring new staff or promoting existing staff are all too
speculative to be calculated at the time of the award. The
Commission believes that the better model to achieve
compliance with P.L. 2010 C. 105 is to utilize the scattergram
demonstrating the placement on the guide of all of the
employees in the bargaining unit as of the end of the year
preceding the new contract, and to simply move those
employees forward through the newly awarded salary scales
and longevity entitiements. Thus, both reductions in costs
resulting from retirements or otherwise, as well as any
increases in costs stemming from promotions or additional
new hires would not affect the costing out of the award
required by the new amendments to the Interest Arbitration
Reform Act.

As Arbitrator Susan Osborn succinctly stated in State of New Jersey and Fraternal Order
of Police 91, P.E.R.C. No. 2016-11 (2015) (NCOA 34-b), P.E.R.C. believes the best
method for costing out an interest arbitration award within the parameters of the 2% Hard
Cap

would be to take the complement of employees on the payroll

‘on the last day before the new contract, and move them

forward through the steps (where increments are being

awarded) and any across the board increases. Thus, the

appropriate starting point to track costs for contract year one

is the total base salaries of unit employees on the last day

before the new contract begins.
The difficulty in this case is that the data that comprises the base salary as of June 30,

2012 (the last day of the CNA) necessary to cost out the agreement is in dispute.

18
The first issue concerns the number of employees in the STFA unit on June 30,
2012, the day the contract expired. Senior members of the STFA unit are occasionally
asked to serve as Acting Sergeants. After eight pay periods, Acting Sergeants are paid
at the higher Sergeant rate. However, until they are promoted, Acting Sergeants remain
in the STFA unit. Witnesses for both the STFA and the Division agreed that there was
confusion as to how many employees were in both the STFA unit and the NCOA unit!"
In addition, there is a dispute concerning the rate of pay for acting Sergeants. The Division
contends that the STFA failed to recognize that Acting Sergeants are paid at the higher
Sergeants’ salary after eight pay periods. (Division brief at 20-21).

There is also a dispute concerning the number of Troopers contained in the STFA
bargaining unit. The STFA contends that as of June 30, 2012 there were 1650 officers in
the unit including: 726 Troopers, 379 Trooper 2s, 372 Trooper 1s, and 173 Acting
Sergeants. (Tr. 1/4 STFA at 9; STFA Ex. 4). The STFA maintains that in determining its
census it relied upon dues’ reports received from the Division's payroll office. (NCOA Tr.
4/4 at 13). The Division contends that the unit contains 202 Acting Sergeants, 1434
Troopers in all classifications, for a total of 1636". (D. Ex. 21). The Division argues that
the STFA used the wrong data and should have made a formal information request so
that the parties could have stipulated as to the precise number of Troopers in the
bargaining unit.

‘A fundamental difference between the parties’ positions is that they dispute what

constitutes base salary for purposes of determining a wage increase. In addition to their

‘The NCOA unit is further complicated by the fact that senior Sergeants are frequently asked to serve as
acting Lieutenants.
12 The census issue was also apparent in the NCOA arbitration.

19
salaries and commencing with the third year of employment, each member of the Division,
including the Superintendent, receives a “maintenance” payment of thirteen thousand six
hundred and forty-nine dollars and three cents ($13,649.03) annually. This maintenance
Payment is phased-in. Troopers in their first year of employment receive a third of the
maintenance amount. Troopers in their second year receive two thirds of the maintenance
amount. Troopers in their third year receive the full amount. The Division contends that
this sum should be included in the base pay calculations. The Division notes that
maintenance is used for the calculation of overtime pay, and the payments are included
in calculating a pension. (Division Brief at 22-24). The STFA contends that maintenance
is not included in base pay. The STFA characterizes maintenance as “a separate
calculation of a common benefit paid to all sworn members of the Division.” (STFA brief
at 14). Maintenance was deemed to be part of base pay in the Mastriani Award'®, (NCOA
Ex. 4 at 38, 75).

Another point of contention between the parties is whether or not members of the
STFA unit should receive a salary increase of the same magnitude as members of the
NCOA. The NCOA salary proposal differs significantly from that of the STFA. The Division
contends that both units have historically, and at least since their 1990 CNA, provided for
the same wage increases in the CNAs applicable to both the NCOA and STFA bargaining
units. (D Ex. 14)

The calculation of the amount of the base salary as of June 30, 2012 is also in
dispute. Under the Mastriani Award, certain retroactive payments were made to

employees in 2012. Ms. LaBruno, the STFA accountant, testified that she included these

'* In 2011, the STFA apparently agreed that base pay included maintenance. (NCOA Ex. 3-¢ at 62-63).

20
retroactive payments in her calculation of the base salary. The STFA contends that under
Borough of New Milford, supra the retroactive amounts paid to bargaining unit employees
should be added to and included in the base salary. The Division asserts that the
retroactive amounts are already included in the salary guide, and that, by including these
amounts in the base salary, the Division contends that the STFA is “artificially” doubling
the retroactive payments. (Division brief at 19, Tr. 11/30 at 82-84).

‘The parties also differ as to the cost of step increases. Ms. LaBruno prepared a
document which demonstrates that there are no step increases within FY2017, meaning
that each member of the STFA bargaining unit will be at the top step by June 30, 2018.
(STFA Ex. 4). The Division disputes this finding.

The Division notes that, under the complicated salary scheme, Troopers advance
horizontally and then diagonally with step increments on the Trooper's anniversary date.

Troopers work under the following salary ranges as of June 30, 2012:

 

Range | incre. | Stepi | Step2 | StepS ) Step4] Step | Step6 | Stop? | Step8 | Steps

(Division Ex. 3 at 27). As Troopers become more experienced they advance through the

ranges and steps both horizontally and diagonally:

(Division Ex. 3 at 28). It takes a Trooper twelve years to reach the top step at range 19.
The Division notes that Ms. LaBruno did not recognize that it would take the 84 officers
at Range 17, Step 1 as of June 30, 2012 twelve years (or not until FY24) to reach Range
19, Step 9. (STFA Ex. 3; STFA Tr. 1/4 at 24-25).

There is also a dispute concerning the amount of step increases paid to Troopers
to calculate base year salaries. Troopers receive their step increases upon the

anniversary date of their graduation from the academy. In certain cases, Ms. LaBruno

22
only factored in a fraction of a Trooper's salary increment because the Trooper's
anniversary date was close to June 30. At the hearing, the parties examined the
compensation of Trooper Jennifer Amato (“Amato”). On June 26, 2012, Trooper Amato
was at Range T17 Step 4 and earning sixty-six thousand five hundred and forty-one
dollars and ninety cents ($66,541.90). Trooper Amato's class graduated from the
Academy on June 27, 2008, On June 27, 2012 she received an increment of two thousand
eight hundred and ninety-six dollars and two cents ($2,896.02). Ms. LaBruno credited
Trooper Amato with step increases of thirty-one dollars and seventy-four cents ($31.74)
for FY2013, FY2014, and FY2015 in each year over all three years. Ms. LaBruno did not
credit Trooper Amato with a step increase for FY 2016. Ms. LaBruno pro-rated the step
increase across two fiscal years, and ignored twenty-eight hundred and sixty-four dollars
and twenty-four cents ($2,864.24) of the money that Trooper Amato would actually
receive. Ms. LaBruno testified that this was “the actual step increase when we did this
that affects the fiscal year, the cost of the step increase.” (STFA Tr. 1/4 at 41-42). The
Division contends that the amount of the step increase must be measured against the
base year salary and not the preceding year. Thus the cost of Trooper Amato's step
increase in FY2014 and FY 2015 was five thousand seven hundred and ninety-two dollars
and four cents ($5,792.04) not sixty-three dollars and forty-eight cents ($63.48) calculated
by Ms. LaBruno. The Division wholly disagrees with LaBruno’s method of calculation.
There is also a difference of opinion as to the manner in which the parties cost out
the various wage proposals. Instead of costing out the wage proposal and determining
how it would be affected by wage increments, Ms. LaBruno took a base year salary

calculation of one hundred and thirty-six million, six hundred and eighty-five thousand,

23
two hundred and fifteen dollars ($136,685,215) compounded a two percent increase for
five years, averaged that calculation and determined that the step movements would raise
the base salary to an average of one hundred and forty-five million, one hundred and
eight thousand, three hundred and thirty-one dollars and_ fifty-three cents
($145,108,331.53), (STFA Ex. 2). The Division contends that Ms. LaBruno should have
calculated the step movement and compared it to the base year, and contends that she
did not properly cost out the STFA’s proposal. The Division claims that the proper way to
do the calculation is to start with a base salary of one hundred and fifty million, eight
hundred and two thousand, four hundred and eight dollars and fifty-four cents
($150,802,408.54). According to the Division the application of the increments results in
an increase over the base salary of 3.49% in Fy13, 6.47% in FY14, 8.93% in FY15,
11.02% in FY16, and 12.38% in FY17. (D. Ex. 21). The Division contends that the
application of these increments far exceeds the 2% Hard Cap.

The Division argues that a wage increase cannot exceed the base year by more
than 10.41% (two percent compounded) for a five-year contract. The Division asserts that
the most the base salary can be increased is fifteen million six hundred and ninety-eight
five hundred and thirty dollars and seventy-three cents ($15,698,530.73) for a total of one
hundred and sixty-six million five hundred thousand nine hundred and thirty-nine dollars
and twenty-seven cents ($166,500,939.27)

The Division also asserts that a wage increase is not necessary to stabilize

employment in the unit.

24
Vil. SALARY and TERM

A. Salary

Having reviewed the competing economic proposals, | have decided to accept as
correct the data provided by the Division. Accordingly, | conclude that the total base salary
for the STFA unit as of June 30, 2013 is one hundred and fifty million, eight hundred and
two thousand, four hundred and eight dollars and fifty-four cents ($150,802,408.54). |
base this conclusion on the fact that the Division has properly included maintenance in
its calculation of the base salary number. | also conclude that the Division’s census is
more trustworthy than the material relied upon by the STFA. In addition, | find that the
Division is correct and that the retroactive payments made pursuant to the Mastriani
‘Award should not be added to base salary, because those payments are already reflected
in the salary guide.

Having determined the base salary, and having reviewed the testimony and record
evidence, | conclude that | am compelled by the exigencies of the Police and Fire Public
Interest Arbitration Reform Act to award the Division's economic proposal. However. as
will be discussed below, | will award the STFA’s proposal regarding the termination of this
agreement. Therefore, | award: a 1.25% across-the-board increase effective the first full
pay period after July 1, 2016. Troopers shall receive normal increments through Pay
Period 20, 2015 only. The term of this agreement shall be July 1, 2012 through June 30,
2017

| am mindful of my obligation to justify this award by applying the statutory criteria
set forth at N.J.S.A. 34:13-16(g). In rendering my award, | am required to make a

reasonable determination of the issues in dispute. | am charged with examining the

25
statutory criteria set forth above, and determining which criteria are or are not relevant
for any given issue. Borough of Hillsdale and PBA 137, 137 N.J. 88 (1994). It is also
recognized that no single one of the statutory criteria will be determinative. The party
seeking to modify the existing terms of a collectively negotiated agreement has the
burden of establishing that there is a basis for the proposed change, and there must be
evidentiary support for such a change. In addition, each proposal must be viewed in the
context of the entire agreement. While a proposal on its face may be reasonable, the
proposal may not be reasonable when placed in the context of other proposals or the
collectively negotiated agreement as a whole.

The first criterion is interest and welfare of the public. In the Mastriani
Award, the arbitrator recognized

the public interest is furthered by the productivity, efficiency

and high morale of the New Jersey State Police as evidenced

by the enormity of its mission that touches upon virtually all of

the major areas of public concern ad safety. The scope and

depth of these services and the skills, training and

competence with which they are performed are not in dispute,

nor is the danger that is associated with this work » . The

public interest also recognizes the budgetary expense of

operating the New Jersey State Police and must be properly

funded.
(Mastriani Award at 45-46).

| believe that the instant award comports with the limits on my authority. This award

recognizes the budgetary difficulties that the State is facing. | am, however, concerned
that the limited amount of funds may have a deleterious effect upon the morale of STFA

bargaining unit.

The second statutory criterion asks me to compare

26
wages, salaries, hours and conditions of employment of the employees
involved in the arbitration proceedings with the wages, hours, and
conditions of employment of other employees performing the same or
similar services and with other employees generally:

(a) In private employment in general; provided, however, each party
shall have the right to submit additional evidence for the arbitrator's
consideration.

(b) In public employment in general; provided, however, each party shall
have the right to submit additional evidence for the arbitrator's
consideration.

(c) _ Inpublic employment in the same or similar comparable jurisdictions,
as determined in accordance with section 5 of P.L. 1995, c.425 (C.
34:13A-16.2); provided, however, that each party shall have the right
to submit additional evidence concerning the comparability of
jurisdictions for the arbitrator's consideration.

(a) In comparative private employment.

(e) In public and private employment in general.

The Comparisons required by the statute are difficult to make for this bargaining
unit. The STFA urges me to compare recent collective bargaining agreements entered
into by other State Police Forces in the Northeast. The STFA notes that a number of
recent collective bargaining agreements in other states have exceeded the 2% increase
in wages that constrains this proceeding. The Division correctly notes that these other
states are not bound by the same statutory requirements especially the 2% Hard Cap,
and those states are experiencing different patterns of economic growth. However, the
Police and Fire Public Interest Arbitration Reform Act, N.J.S.A., 34:13-16(g) mandates
that the award take note of the contents of the collective bargaining agreements in similar
jurisdictions. | conclude that comparing the terms of this CNA to terms reached by other
state police forces is appropriate, since those police forces perform the most nearly
identical function to the Division. Never the less they are of limited utility in this analysis.

The Division urges me to review other agreements reached by the State of New

Jersey which contain limited wage increases, and reflect New Jersey's fiscal situation.

27
Having reviewed these other agreements, | conclude that this award is within the
parameters of agreements reached in the State of New Jersey, while recognizing the
unique role of the State Police.

| would also note that this agreement will depart from the historical pattern where
the NCOA unit and the STFA unit have traditionally received the same wage increases".
| believe that such a departure is appropriate and necessary because members of the
STFA unit receive many more increments than do the members of the NCOA unit which
has to be absorbed under the 2% Hard Cap. Because of the statutory limitations under
the 2% Hard Cap, members of the STFA are precluded from receiving a general wage
increase. The Division has conceded that members of the NCOA unit should receive the
increments previously suspended in pay period 20 in 2015"®, (Tr. 11/30 125). | conclude
that in this award there must a departure from the historical linkage between the STFA
contract and the NCOA contract.

Finally, there are no private sector comparators that are relevant to this discussion

Another criterion to be considered is the overall compensation of the members of
the STFA unit. While members at the top steps of the salary scale are well compensated,
under the terms of this award, more junior Troopers will have to wait quite some time for
a salary increase, and this may encourage some Troopers to seek employment
elsewhere. Another aspect of the overall compensation issue is the fact that, as a result
of Chapter 78, members of the NCOA bargaining unit have had real declines in their take

home pay. Sergeant Kiernan testified that, as a result of Chapter 78, his salary was

 

‘The NCOA award will be issued simultaneously with this award,
‘S L make no finding as to whether or not the cessation of the contractual increments constituted an unfair
Practice or not.

28
reduced by $9,100. This award does little to compensate members of the STFA unit for
their reduction in earnings.

There are no stipulations between the parties concerning these negotiations.

The criteria governing “the lawful authority of the Employer” is not at issue.

| conclude that this award properly recognizes New Jersey's fiscal problems. | am
awarding a modest wage increase that will have a limited financial impact on State
finances. Ultimately, this is the key reason for the issuance of this award.

In this proceeding, the parties presented limited evidence concerning the cost of
living. A United States Bureau of Labor Statistics News Release indicates that the
consumer price index has only gone up moderately. (NCOA Ex. 21). New Jersey remains
a state with a very high cost of living. (NCOA Ex.22). This cost of living issue has only a
limited impact on my award.

|am concerned that this award will have a deleterious impact upon the continuity
and stability of the STFA bargaining unit. The record evidence shows that since 2010,
there has been a decline in the total number of Troopers on the Division's payroll, and an
increase in retirements. However, as noted throughout this document the 2% Hard Cap
has left me no choice but to limit the amount of any salary increase.

B. Term

The Division is seeking a six-year term for this agreement. The Division contends
that this would permit the NCOA unit and STFA unit to remain locked in a pattern, and
would permit a modest wage increase to be paid to the members of the STFA unit.

The STFA is seeking a five-year term. The STFA argues that historically

agreements between the parties have been for four years. Apparently, the STFA would

29
be amenable to such a four-year term but notes that the shorter term would require the
parties to resume bargaining almost immediately. The STFA also notes that the statute
mandating the 2% Hard Cap is set to expire in 2017. N.J.S.A. 34:13a-16.7a. The STFA
believes that there might be a possibility for more fruitful negotiations with the expiration
of the Hard Cap law. In addition, the STFA hopes that there might be some future relief
from the requirements of Chapter 78
| award the STFA’s proposal concerning the term of the CNA. The possible
elimination of the 2% Hard Cap in 2017 would certainly change the environment for public
sector unions, and provide the parties with a chance to exercise more economic freedom
at the negotiating table.
Vill. THE DIVISION’S NON-SALARY PROPOSALS
1. Proposal to eliminate transportation allowance
The present CNA provides:

All employees not provided transportation shall be

compensated at the rate of twenty-seven (27) cents per mile

for travel in their vehicle to and from their place of assignment

and permanent place of residence in excess of twenty (20)

highway miles each way. This mileage rate shall be adjusted

on a cents per mile basis equal to adjustments made in

paragraph 6 below.
(NCOA Ex. 2 Art. XIll (B) (5).

Division Position

The Division proposes eliminating this provision for Troopers entering the

Academy on or after January 1, 2016. At present, all Troopers receive an allowance if

they drive in excess of twenty miles to their place of work. The Division contends that

employees should not be paid for commuting to work, and notes that the vast majority of

30
State employees do not receive such an allowance. The Division characterizes the
transportation allowance as excessive.

The Division also rejects the STFA’s argument that the allowance is justified
because Troopers are always on duty, and there is no reason why a Trooper who drives
less that twenty miles to work is under any more or less of an obligation than a Trooper
who drives in excess of twenty miles. The Division asserts that the proposal reflects a
broader State policy that employees should not be paid for commuting. At present, the
only State bargaining unit that receives this benefit in the New Jersey Law Enforcement
Supervisors Association. The Division also notes that its proposal to phase out the benefit
as proposed will only be applicable to Troopers entering the Academy after January 1,
2016.

STFA’s Position

The STFA vigorously opposes the elimination of the Transportation Allowance.
The STFA takes the position that all Troopers are held to higher standards than other
employees and are always on duty. The STFA notes that troopers in transit are bound to
respond to any “public safety or criminal circumstance” that comes to their attention.
(NCOA Exs. 38 & 39). The STFA also notes that recently Arbitrator Thomas Hartigan
found that the Division violated Article XXVI.B of the STFA CNA when it eliminated toll
free passage on toll roads for Troopers commuting to their assignments. (NCOA Ex. 51)

My Award

| award the Division's proposal in part. | find that the Division has made a

compelling argument that the vast majority of employees of the State of New Jersey are

Not given a mileage allowance for commuting to work, and that the elimination of this

31
benefit is appropriate. However, the benefit will be eliminated for Troopers entering the
Academy after January 1, 2017 and not January 1, 2016. This is because Troopers may
have already commenced their training and it would be unfair to remove this benefit. In
addition, the elimination of this benefit is only for Troopers commuting to their regular
assignment. In the event a Trooper entering the Academy after January 1, 2017 is
required to drive to an emergency muster point’ or to some assignment other than his or
her regular assignment in excess of twenty miles from his or her permanent place of
residence, that Trooper will be entitled to the transportation allowance.

2. The Proposal to eliminate the $500 Education Incentive for an
employee with 60 credits or an Associate's Degree.

The Division's Position

At present Troopers who achieve a certain level of educational attainment are
entitled to receive an annual incentive payment. Troopers who have eamed sixty (60)
college credits or an associates’ degree receive five hundred dollars ($500). Troopers
who have a bachelor’s degree receive on thousand dollars ($1000). Troopers who have
attained a master’s degree or above receive fifteen hundred dollars ($1,500). The Division
proposes to eliminate only the education incentive for an employee who has earned sixty
(60) credits or an associate's degree.

The Division relies on the testimony of Director Dee, and characterizes the benefit
as an ‘outdated relic.” In order to qualify for entry into the State Trooper Academy, a
bachelor's degree is currently the “price of admission.” (Tr. 11/30 at 107). At present, an

applicant can gain admission to the academy with an associate's degree if the applicant

*® Such mustering takes place during a natural disaster when Troopers are directed to the most impacted
part of the state.

32
also has “at least twenty-four months of satisfactory employment or military service; or
thirty college credits plus at least 24 months of active duty military service with honorable
discharge.” (D Ex. 4)

The Division notes that the only other State CNA that provides for an educational
incentive are the investigators employed by the Division of Criminal Justice, and those
incentives are only given to investigators with bachelor’s and master's degrees and do
not include associate's degrees.

The STFA Position

The STFA opposes this proposal. The STFA contends that the proposal is
inconsistent with other Division proposals governing promotion which require a certain
educational attainment. The STFA contends that a Trooper's educational attainment is a
benefit to the Division and the general public, and is an essential element of the
promotional process. The STFA notes that the Trooper bears the cost of achieving the
necessary credits, and contends that the State should not be permitted “to take away the
measly Five Hundred Dollar ($500.00) stipend.”

My Award

| partially award the Division's proposal. The evidence shows that in 2014, one
hundred and ninety-six (196) Troopers and one hundred and twenty-three (123)
Sergeants received the five hundred dollar ($500) stipend. The total cost of the stipend
was one hundred fifty-nine thousand dollars ($159,500). (Tr. 11/30 at 109-110, D. Ex. 5).

In the overall context of the Division's budget this is a small sum. In light of the fact
that there will be no wage increase, | conclude that it would be unjust to take away this

benefit from employees who have relied upon this stipend. On the other hand, the Division

33
has established that, in order to enter the Academy an associate's degree by itself is no
longer sufficient. Accordingly, Troopers entering the Academy after January 1, 2017 will
no longer be entitled to the five hundred dollar ($500) stipend for achieving an associate's
degree.
3. Contributions for Retiree Health Care
The Division's Position

The Division notes that, in the 2007-2011 contract cycle most, New Jersey State
employees began contributing a portion of their salaries to cover the rising costs of
healthcare. (Tr. 11/30 at 110). With the exception of Division Employees, most employees
covered by a CNA were required to contribute 1.5% of their annual base salary. (Tr. 11/30
at 110, D. Ex. 15). The Division also notes that, under the Pension and Health Care
Benefits Act, Chapter 78, P.L. 2011 ("Chapter 78’), State employees were required to pay
@ percentage of the cost of health benefits for themselves and for their dependents both
as active employees and retirees,

The Division points out that some employees were required to make these
contributions as of Chapter 78's effective date, and others were required to make these
Contributions upon the expiration of the applicable CNA When Chapter 78 was passed,
most State employees with twenty (20) years of service at the time the statute became
effective, were not required to make contributions. However, after the passage of Chapter
78, even State employees with twenty years of service were required to make
Contributions to their retiree health insurance Coverage. No such provision mandating

employee contributions was made for employees represented by the STFA. At present,

34
forty-five employees of the Division are not required to contribute to their post-retirement
health care costs.

The Division contends that this anomaly ignores the ever increasing burden on
health care costs on the State’s budget and is contrary to the pattern that exists for all
other State employees. Accordingly, the Division asks that | award the following change
in language:

Those employees who accrued 25 years of creditable service
on or before June 30, 2012 will not contribute towards the cost
of premiums for post-retirement medical benefits. Those
employees who have 20 or more years of creditable service
on June 28, 2011, and who accrue 25 or more years of
pension credit and retire or retire on a disability retirement on
or after June 30, 2015, will contribute 1.5% of the monthly
retirement allowance toward the cost of post-retirement
medical benefits as is required under law. Those employees
who have fewer than 20 years of creditable service on June
28, 2011 and who accrue 25 or more years of pension credit
and retire on or after July 1, 2011, will contribute toward the
cost of post-retirement medical benefits in accordance with
the grid established by P.L. 2011, c. 78 for the duration of this
contract.

 

The Division contends that this proposal closes a loophole in Chapter 78. The
Division notes that its proposal only affects Troopers who have 20 years of experience as
of June 28, 2011 and who retire after June 30, 2016. In its brief, the Division further
Modified its proposal to provide that it go into effect after the date of this award. (Division
Brief at 42 n. 36). The Division contends that the proposal is modest and reflects not the
actual premium cost but only 1.5% of the pension benefit. Thus, if a Trooper receives a
pension of fifty thousand dollars ($50,000) per year, the Trooper's contribution for his

post-retirement health insurance would only be seven hundred and fifty dollars ($750)

35
The STFA’s Position
The STFA takes the position that | do not have the authority to award the Division's
proposal. The STFA points to the language in N.J.S.A. 34:13A-18 which states that an
arbitrator “shall not issue any finding, opinion or order reducing eliminating or otherwise
modifying retiree benefits.” The STFA contends that if | were to award the Division's
proposal I would be violating the statute.
My Award
| do not award the Division's proposal. While, | recognize that this determination
departs from the pattern that covers vast majority of State employees, | agree with the
position of the STFA that the requirement that retirees contribute to their post-retirement
health insurance is governed by Chapter 78 and N.J.S.A. 34:13A-18. It is for the
legislature to determine that these employees should make these contributions not an
interest arbitrator.
4. Elimination of Clothing Allowance
The Division's position
Under the STFA CNA, non-uniformed officers receive a nine hundred dollars
($900) per year clothing allowance, while uniformed officers receive an eight hundred
dollars ($800) per year allowance for uniform maintenance. The Division proposes
eliminating the one hundred dollar ($100) difference between non-uniformed and
uniformed personnel. Non-uniformed personnel would still receive the eight hundred
dollar ($800) allowance that uniformed personnel receive. The Division recognizes that

non-uniformed officers are still required to maintain a uniform and that is why it is not

36
proposing the elimination of the benefit for non-uniformed personnel. The Division
contends that this will provide parity between uniformed and non-uniformed personnel.
In making this proposal the Division relies on a 2011 report issued by the Office
of the New Jersey State Comptroller: An Analysis of Clothing Allowance Payments to
White Collar New Jersey State Employees. (D Ex.6). The Comptroller's report was critical
of the fact that the State paid approximately four million eight hundred thousand dollars
($4.8 million) in negotiated clothing allowance benefits to white collar employees, and that
nine percent (9%) of this amount went to employees in the New Jersey Department of
Law and Public Safety. The Division contends that it is unfair to pay the extra sum to the
non-uniformed officers.
The STFA’s position
The STFA opposes the elimination of the extra hundred dollars ($100) payment
in clothing allowance. The STFA contends that the Division has not identified the number
of officers affected by the additional payment, nor has the Division identified any abuse
or misuse of the allowance.
The STFA also notes that N.J.S.A. 53:1-6, which was passed before the New
Jersey Employer Employee Relations Act, provides in pertinent part:
Any person assigned to detective work in the department shall
receive, while on such duty, an increase in salary in an
amount to be fixed by the superintendent, subject to the
approval of the head of the Department of Law and Public

Safety, sufficient to defray the expenses for civilian clothing
necessarily required in said assignment.

The STFA contends that, based on the statute, detectives are entitled to the additional

Payment. In addition, the STFA notes that unlike other police departments, detectives do

37
not get a salary differential. The STFA is also critical of the Comptroller's report, because
the purported abuse that the report identifies concerns non-Division employees.
My Award

| do not award the Division's proposal. As the STFA points out, there is a statute
that governs clothing allowances for detective work. N.J.S.A. 53:1-6 specifically provides
for an increase in salary for detectives. The modest differential of one hundred dollars
($100) is a reasonable effort to comply with the statutory mandate and | will not disturb
that determination. | also agree that the Division is unlike many other police forces in not
paying a detective differential. There is no compelling reason to award the Division's
proposal.

5. Reduction of Association Security Days
The Division's Position

Under the CNA, STFA officers are given a total of 325 association leave days.
(STFA Ex. 2, Article XXVI(B)). The Division proposes reducing this allotment by twelve
(12) days. The Division contends that the State is attempting to negotiate reductions in
union leave across all public employee units.

The Division relies on a report of the State Commission of Investigation (SCI)
entitled: Union Work, Public Pay: The Taxpayer Cost of Compensation and Benefits for
Public Employee Union Leave ("Report’) (D Ex. 8) which was critical of the burden placed
on taxpayers caused by union leave in the public sector. The Report found that, between
2006 and 2011 government paid union leave cost New Jersey taxpayer more than thirty

million dollars. (D Ex. 8 at 3).

38
The Division notes that the Governor's Office of Employee Relations has
Negotiated reductions in union leave ranging from ten percent to twenty-eight percent.
The Division also contends that the type of leave already available to union
representatives to attend arbitrations, conduct negotiations or to handle grievances will
be unaffected. (Tr, 12/2 at 31).

The STFA Position

‘The STFA opposes the reduction in the number of Association days, and contends
that the Division is seeking to diminish bargaining unit rights and that it has failed to
Provide a rationale or support for the proposition. The STFA contends that the Division
has not met its burden in justifying a change in the CNA

My Award

' do not award this proposal. | find that the Division has not carried its burden, and
failed to distinguish between the loss of days between the STFA and NCOA units. Beyond
saying the Division would like a ten percent reduction in Association days, | conclude that
without more detail the change in the agreement is unwarranted.

6. The Division's Proposals on Holidays
The Division's Position

The Division is seeking to align the CNA with the statute establishing paid holidays
for State employees. Under N.JS.A. 11A:6-24 1 paid holidays granted to State
employees are limited to the following

(1) January 1, known as New Year's Day;

(2) the third Monday in January, known as Martin Luther
King’s Birthday;

39
(3) the third Monday in February, known as Washington's
Birthday, which shall be known and celebrated as Presidents
Day in this State;

(4) the day designated and known as Good Friday;

(5) the last Monday in May, known as Memorial Day;

(6) July 4, known as Independence Day;

(7) the first Monday in September, known as Labor Day;

(8) the second Monday in October, known as Columbus
Day;

(9) November 11, known as Armistice Day or Veterans’
Day;

(10) the fourth Thursday in November, known as
Thanksgiving Day;

(11) December 25, known as Christmas Day; and
(12) any general election day in this State.

Prior to the statutory amendment, State employees were entitled to take both
Washington's Birthday and Lincoln's Birthday as holidays. These holidays have now been
combined and celebrated as President's day

The Division notes that the Mastriani Award specifically provided for the elimination
Of Lincoln's Birthday. (NCOA Ex. 4 at 77). The Division asks that the CNA reflect this
change. The Division is also asking for some technical changes to this provision

The STFA Position

The STFA opposes this change in the CNA. The STFA contends that the Division

has not presented evidence that would justify making this change. The STFA asks that |

reject this proposal on procedural grounds. (NCOA brief at 43)

40
My Award
| partially award this proposal. The proposal would merely codify the status
quo, and would comply with both the statute and the Mastriani Award. Accordingly, when
the successor CNA is prepared, the Division's language should be included. However,
the technical language changes were not described in the record, and | conclude that the
Division did not carry its burden of establishing the need for those changes.
7. The Proposal to Share the Cost of Printing the CNA
The Division's Positon
The Division proposes to share the cost of printing the successor CNA with the
STFA. The Division asserts that it has successfully negotiated this provision with other
unions. These unions have agreed to either print the CNA or to have the document
available electronically. (Tr. 11/30 at 118). The Division contends that the proposal is
reasonable.
The STFA position
The STFA opposes this proposal. The STFA notes that the Division did not
introduce evidence concerning the cost of printing the agreement, nor did the Division
identify the contractor or office responsible for printing the CNA. The STFA contends that
the Division has not met its burden that would permit a change in the CNA.
My Award
' do not award this proposal. In order to justify this change, the Division should
have introduced evidence establishing the costs of printing the CNA. While | credit Mr.

Dee's testimony regarding the State's ability to secure this change in other bargaining

41
units, without more information in the context of the State's relationship with the STFA a
decision to change the status quo would be inappropriate.
8. Proposal on Promotions
The Division's position

The Division is seeking to remove language in the current contract pertaining to
Promotional standards and instead cross reference that language to Operational
Instruction 15-23 (“Ol”). The Division contends that the Ol should guide the promotional
Process and remove inconsistency or ambiguity between the Ol and the CNA. The
Division also notes that the STFA as well as the NCOA were involved in drafting the OI.
The Division contends that there is no threat to employee rights.

The Division points out that the grievances contesting the application of the
promotional process are resolved by the Attorney General, and that, under PERC case
law, issues concerning the right to promotions are non-mandatory subjects of bargaining.
(Division Brief at 55 citing Teaneck Bd. Of Ed. V. Teaneck Teachers Ass'n, 94 NJ.
9(1983).

The STFA’s position

The STFA opposes this proposal. The STFA primarily contends that Operational
Instructions only have a duration of one year, that the OI referenced in the Division's
Proposal has not yet been finalized, and that the last Ol referred to has been rescinded.

The STFA concedes that promotions are a managerial prerogative, but contends
that the CNA's provisions concerning procedures for promotion contain important rights

for members of the bargaining unit.

42
My Award
| do not award this proposal find that the Division hes made a good case for
stream lining the promotional process and for eliminating sources of friction between the
Ol and the CNA. However, | find that STFA’s arguments are more compelling. First, the
fact that operational instructions only have a year’s duration is problematic, and it seems
unfair to require the STFA to modify the CNA if they are unsure what they will receive in
return. In addition, | conclude that the Division has not met its burden on this issue
because the OI that the Division intends to insert has not been finalized.
8, Proposal on Expedited Grievance Handling
The Division's Position
The CNA has an expedited grievance procedure. (STFA Ex 2, Article XVI (G)(3))-
if a grievance arises, the STFA may, within seven days of the event, ask that the
grievance be processed in an expedited manner. In that event, the Superintendent must
answer the grievance within forty-eight hours. In the ‘event the Superintendent denies the
grievance, the STFA may appeal to a special arbitrator. However, at present, there is no
time limit on the STFA’s response. The Division asks that, for expedited grievances, the
STFA make its decision to appeal to the special arbitrator within forty-eight hours. The
Division contends that its proposal is consistent with the expedited nature of the
proceeding.
The STFA’S Position
The STFA opposes this change. The STFA contends that the Division has not met
its burden concerning this issue, and notes that Trooper schedules may preclude

immediate responses to the ‘Superintendent's decision.

43
My Award
| partially award this proposal. If the STFA determines that a particular grievance
Merits expedited treatment by the Superintendent, it should not be permitted to indefinitely
delay the processing of the grievance. On the other hand, Trooper schedules and
administrative requirements may preclude a response within forty-eight hours of the
Superintendent's denial of the grievance. | conclude that the STFA should appeal within
seven days of receipt of the Superintendent's denial of the grievance.
9. Contract Negotiations
The Division's Position
Article XXVIII of the CNA governs contract negotiations. The Division is proposing
to eliminate language in paragraphs “A" and “B" which provides that the contracts shall
be “automatically renewed from year to year unless either party shall notify the other in
writing by certified mail prior to October 1 in the year preceding the contract expiration.”
The Division characterizes its proposal as language cleanup. The Division states
that granting its proposal would remove the danger of either party missing an arbitrary
deadline resulting in a continuation of the existing contract for an additional year'”.
The STFA’S Position
The STFA opposes this proposal. The Union contends that there is nothing in the
record to justify this change.
My Award
'do not award this proposal. | conclude that the Division has not met its burden in

establishing this need for the change in language.

 

1" The proposed change also seeks to have the contract expire in 2018. That provision is not awarded
and is discussed elsewhere in this document.

44
10. Eye Care Proposal
The Division's Position

The Division is proposing the following change to the language governing eye care in
the CNA: Eye Care Program

1. Fulltime employees and eligible dependents shall be eligible for the State-
administered Eye Care Program. The Program shalll provide for each eligible employee
and dependent to receive a $40 payment for prescription eye glasses with regular lenses
and a $45 payment for such glasses with bi-focal lenses. Each eligible employee and
dependent may receive only one (1) payment during the two (2) year period ending June
30, 2044, and only one (1) payment during the two (2) year period commencing July 1,
2014, and only one (1) payment during the two (2) year period commencing July 4
20160. The extension of benefits to dependents shall be effective only after the
employee has been continuously employed for a minimum of sixty (60) days.

Ys Eligible dependents of full-time employees shall be eligible for a maximum
payment of $35 or the non-reimbursed cost whichever is less, of an eye examination by
an Ophthalmologist or Optometrist, during the two (2) year period ending June 30, 2044
, and only one payment during the two (2) year period commencing July 1, 2014 and
only one (1) payment during the two (2) year period commencing July 1, 2016. The
program ends on June 30, 2018. Proper affidavits and submissions of receipts are
required of the member in order to receive payment._1. Full-time employees and eligible
dependents shall be eligible for the State-administered Eye Care Program. The
Program shall provide for each eligible employee and dependent to receive a $40
payment for prescription eye glasses with regular lenses and a $45 payment for such
glasses with bi-focal lenses. Each eligible employee and dependent may receive only
‘one (1) payment during the two (2) year period ending June 30, 2044, and only one (1)
payment during the two (2) year period commencing July 1, 2014, and only one (1)

payment during the two (2) year period commencing July 1, 20169. The extension of
benefits to dependents shall be effective only after the employee has been continuously

employed for a minimum of sixty (60) days.

 

 

In addition, the Division is also seeking similar changes to the Dental program. (D Ex. 2).
The Division characterizes these changes as “language cleanup” and asks for an award

in its favor.
i. The STFA's Position
The STFA objects on the grounds that there was no testimony regarding this issue.

The STFA also states the Division has not provided the cost for these proposals. In

45
addition, the STFA notes that a similar Proposal was rejected in State of New Jersey and
FOP Lodge 91, supra. In that award Arbitrator Osborn held:

As to the State's proposal to make the benefit available in
specified two-year increments, this is inconsistent with other
State contracts and ignores the possibility that some
employees did not receive a reimbursement in the last two
years, or need glasses for the first time in 2014. Therefore,
language permitting reimbursement once in a two-year period
is more appropriate. Finally, | decline to include language that
would sunset the clause upon the expiration of the contract.
The State's proffered reason that it wants the option to
terminate the program if it wishes flies in the face of collective
negotiations, is inconsistent with the provisions of other State
contracts, and is not in the public interest, which favors
collective negotiations over unilateral action’®. (N-34D, p.115)

ji, My Award
| partially award this proposal. As to the Dental program, there was no testimony
regarding the program, and | will not award any changes to that program. As to the Eye
Care program, | do not find it necessary to include the sunset provision in my award. The
Sunset provision would have terminated on June 30, 2018. The parties will be free to
negotiate any changes governing this program commencing in 2017. | recognize that
P.E.R.C has awarded a sunset provision and that such a provision is consistent other
CNAs, but | find it unnecessary to include such a provision in this award because the CNA
will have expired prior to the application of the proposed sunset provision.
On the other hand, in this proposal there are changes in the language to reflect
new dates for the program. | will award those changes. The language will now read:
1. Fulltime employees and eligible dependents shall be eligible for the State-

administered Eye Care Program. The Program shall provide for each eligible employee
and dependent to receive a $40 payment for prescription eye glasses with regular lenses

PERC. modified Arbitrator Osbom's award and directed that the sunset language be included in the
CNA at issue.

46
and a $45 payment for such glasses with bi-focal lenses. Each eligible employee and
dependent may receive only one (1) payment during the two (2) year period ending June
30, 2016 and one (1) payment during the two (2) year period commencing July 1, 2016,
and only one (1) payment during the two (2) year period commencing July 1, 2018. The
extension of benefits to dependents shall be effective only after the employee has been
continuously employed for a minimum of sixty (60) days.

2. _ Eligible dependents of full-time employees shall be eligible for a maximum
Payment of $35 or the non-reimbursed cost whichever is less, of an eye examination by
an Ophthalmologist or Optometrist, during the two (2) year period ending June 30, 2016,
and only one payment during the two (2) year period commencing July 1, 2016 and only
one (1) payment during the two (2) year period commencing July 1, 2016. Proper
affidavits and submissions of receipts are required of the member in order to receive
payment.

IX, The UNION’S NON-ECONOMIC PROPOSAL

The STFA'S Position
The STFA has made only one non-economic proposal, which is related to
discipline. The proposal states:

Where a member under investigation for a disciplinary charge is placed in
a ‘no pay” status and a final determination on said investigation is not
completed within one hundred eighty (180) calendar days from the date of
said member's suspension without pay then said member shall,
commencing on the 181% calendar day, begin to receive pay that said
member was being paid at the time of suspension and shall continue to do
so until the date of final determination:

|tis proposed that where a member is acquitted of administrative or criminal

charges or if said charges are ultimately resolved in the member's favor

then the member shall be made whole including full back pay and shall be

reimbursed for the expense of said member's defense. Said payments shall

be promptly made.

The STFA points out that at present a Trooper who is accused of an administrative
or criminal infraction can be suspended without pay or health insurance while an
investigation or investigations of the infraction may continue indefinitely. The STFA notes
that this creates a hardship for the Trooper and his or her family. In addition, STFA

47
President Christopher Burgos testified that the Trooper's ability to find other work is
subject to the approval of the Superintendent of the Division. (STFA Tr. 79-82)

The STFA notes that local police and firefighters are protected by statute. N.J.S.A
40A:14-201 provides, in pertinent part, that local police and firefighters shall receive his
or her base salary after the officer has been suspended for one hundred and eighty days:

Ifa final determination is not rendered within those 180 days
as hereinafter calculated, the officer or firefighter shall,
commencing with a 181% calendar day, begin to receive the
base salary he was being paid at the time of his suspension

and shall continue to do so until a final determination on the
officer or firefighter’s termination is rendered.

The STFA claims to be seeking equity with local police and firefighters. The STFA
notes that the second portion of its proposal seeks back pay for suspended Troopers.
The STFA reasons that since the Superintendent has the power to order back pay when
directing that a Trooper be restored to duty, the Division might place undue pressure on
the Trooper to return to duty with little or no back pay.

The STFA states that it is not trying to revise the review process or to unduly
interfere with an investigation. The STFA is trying to alleviate the economic hardship of
suspended members.

The Division's Position

The Division notes that allegations of Officer Misconduct are handled by the Office
of Professional Standards (“OPS”). OPS receives allegations of officer misconduct,
investigates the allegations and makes recommendations to the Superintendent
regarding discipline. The Division states that OPS attempts to conclude its administrative
investigations within 120 days, but that circumstances may require that it take additional

time. Once a recommendation for discipline is submitted to the Superintendent, the

48
‘Superintendent has forty-five days to act. The Trooper may appeal to the New Jersey
Office of Administrative Law which issues recommendations which are either adopted or
rejected by the Superintendent. Final decisions may be appealed to the New Jersey
Superior Court Appellate Division
If OPS determines that the allegations against the Trooper might be subject to a
criminal investigation, OPS will not take any steps until the criminal investigation is
concluded.
The Division asserts that its procedures for handling internal investigations have
been nationally recognized as a model for law enforcement. Major Mark Wondrack
testified that, on average, there are only ten Troopers suspended at any one time.
Suspensions only occur under the following circumstances:
1. The employee is unfit for duty;
2. The employee is a hazard to any person if permitted to
remain on the job;
3. An immediate suspension is necessary to maintain safety,
health, order or effective direction of public services;
4. The employee has been formally charged with a first,
second or third degree crime; or
5. The employee has been formally charged with a first,
second, third or fourth degree crime or a disorderly persons
offense committed while on duty, or the act touches upon his
or her employment.

(Tr. 12/2 at 63).

The Division contends that an award granting this proposal would violate public
Policy. It notes that the statute relied upon by the Association was passed after the
Appellate Division's decision in Kelty v. State Dept. of Law and Public Safety, Div. of State
Police, 321 N.J. Super. 84 (App. Div. 1999). The Court noted in Kelty that a “public officer

who renders no service is not entitled to prevail in an action seeking compensation.” /d.

49
Citing, Demarco v. Board of Chosen Freeholders of Bergen County, 21 N.J. 136, 143
(1956). Kelty involved an appeal by a suspended police officer who was ultimately
vindicated on appeal and who sought back pay. The Court refused to order back pay
because there was no statute which would have permitted such a payment.

The Division also argues that the proposal, as written, limits the Superintendent's
authority. N.J.S.A. 53:1-10 empowers the Superintendent to make all rules and
regulations regarding discipline of Division employees.

In addition, the Division argues that the length of an investigation is frequently not
in its control and may depend upon criminal investigations by other agencies. The Division
characterizes the one hundred eighty (180) day limitation as artificial.

Finally, the Division notes that if charges are dismissed the Superintendent has
the power to award back pay.

My Award

' do not award this proposal. The Legislature has chosen to provide salary and
benefits to local police and firefighters after they have been suspended for over one
hundred and eighty (180) days. The Legislature has chosen not to extend this benefit to

members of the Division. | will not substitute my judgment for that of the Legislature.
