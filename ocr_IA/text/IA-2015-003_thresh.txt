Neither party presented arguments in their respective

or the new contracl. I intend to award effeclive dates

 

 

for the new contract for the full Live-year period extending

 

from July 1, 2014 through June 30, 2019. This term is

An Arbitrator shali not render any award pursuanz to
seclion 3 of P.J 1977, ¢.85 (C.34:33A-16) which, on
an annual basis, increases base salary items by more
than 2.¢ percent of the aggregate amount. expended by
the public employer on base salary ilems for the
members of the affected employee organization in the
twelve months immediately preceding the expiration of
Lhe collective negotiation agreement subject Lo
arbilralion; provided, however, the parties may agree
or the arbitrator may decide, to distribute the
aggregate money value of the award over the term of
the coliective negotiation agreement in unequai annual
percentages. An award of an arbitrator shall nec
include base salary items and non-salary cconomic
issues which were not incladed in the prios collective
negotiations agreement.

 

 

 

 

   

  

 

 

 

The State argues that this statutory limitation applies to

this av

 

ard. It contends that any other conclusion would be

iliegical and contrary to the legislative intent. The Stace

    

ers that any reasonable interpretalion of the relevant
amendments to the Inlerest Arbitration Act must conclude that

the 28 cap applies here. The relevan= provision concerning the

effective date of the amendmen

 

provide

 

 

Ihis act snall take ef. January 1, 29)1; provided
however, section 2 of P.U.2010, c.105 (C.34:13A-
16.7} [the “cap” provision} shall apply only to
collective negotiations between a public employer and
the exclusive representative of a public police
department or public fire department that relate vo

     

 
negotiated agreemenls expiring on that effective date
or any date thereafter until or on December 31, 2017,
whereupon, after December 21, 2617, the provisions of
section 2 of P.L.2010, ¢.105 (C.34:13A-16.7) sha
become inoperative for 411 parties excoyt Lhose whose
coliective negotiations agreements expired prior to or
on December 31, 2017 but for whom a final settlement
has not been ed.

 

 

 

 

This act shall take effect immediately and shail ve
retroactive to April 2, 2014.

N.J.8

 

34: 13A-16.9.

 

 

Whigs matter concerns a newly established ne

   

 

ard a first contract. ue is a first contract.
Ostensibiy, the Union would have Lhe Arbitrater conclude that

because there is no “expiring” negctialions agreement, the 2%

 

cap does not apply. Such a conclusion is erroneous as it
igneres the precepts of statutory construction and is contrary

to the Legislature’s intent.

 

Further, Lhe State contends thal Lhe Unio
interpretation, taken to its logical extreme, would lead to the

absurd result that the interest arbitratien act does not ap

  

to Lisst contracts

  

 

 

The State continues that N.J.S.A. 34:13A-16 through -Z1 is

  

the section of the New Jersey Employer-Employse Relations Act

commonly reterred tc as the “Interest Arbilralion Act.” Nowhere

in Lhe Act is reference made to agrcemenls for newly formed

   

negotialions unils or first contracts. To the contrary
reference is made throughout the entire Act to expiring

collec

 

tive negotiations agreements. For cxample, the provisions

that Bou detectives are about 12% below the average pay rate for

calculation that lead to this conclusion. Young’s assertion

 

provides no basis for the arbitrator to award Lhe Union's wage

 

 

proposal. fact, for these benchmarks in 2013 the Division
ranked 17 out of 22 in both categories. The Division’s

detectives are paid less on average than their county

   

counterparts. wever, there is nothing in Young's report to

 

conclude that the detectives shuuld be paid more than the
average. Moreaver, nothing in the interest arbitration statute
suggests that an average wage rate alone is suifictent to

justify an increase without any analysis of whether some of the

Further, the detective's average median salary is $85,849 which

so its ending [und balance of $300 million; and $31.5 biilion

worth of revenues. Peden added tha: secavse of the shortfall in

 

enues, the State would have to ideatily a series of “lapses”

 

in order to balance the budget. (47-11)

   

A lapse is appropriated money which, if not spent, comes

 

back te the Slate’s general fund to assist in balancing its
budget. Peden further testified that there are two categories
of lapses on the chart above: the first is a series with
hundreds of difterent accounts that. were examined for
opportunities Lo lapse $812 million; the second lapse is a

State

tiled a “pension” lapse. eden stated [hat sometimes the

 

freezes appropriated accounls and sometimes it returns monies

that have been appropriated and place it in the State‘s surplus.
  

Together, between the two lapses an@ its revenues, the State has
an ending fund balance of $300 million, which goes back into

sucpius in the general fund.

 

The Union points to the $200 mi

 

on in surpius as a

 

Pp tial source zo fund salary increases. However, Peden

 

testified tha rrent surplus amount does act

The State argues Lhat the Division is currently
experiencing wage compression challenges. Awarding the Union's
proposal would exacerbate the wage compression Lo untenable
ievels. It notes that sergeants are presently being paid in
salary range 30 (at a top pay of $105,820) and licuLenants are
presently being paid in salary range 33 (at a top pay of
$156,129). The deputy chiel of detectives has a salary of
$109,200. Therefore, awarding the Union’s proposed range

changes with a lop pay for detective IT at $110,787 wovid put
 

those employees above the pay rate for sergeants and would

 

create compression with higher rark:

I agree with the State's position that yrauling Lhe

 

proposed range changes would compound the compression propien

 

aiceady exists, which in turn would negatively impact

  

employee morale to those above and make it unlikely detectives

 

would ever scck promotions. Further, I de act believe that T

it is the Department of Civil Service which controls the selling

(FOP-32) Given that chis is che policy she Division of Criminal

Yo the extent thar the FOP’s preposal tracks the lanquage of the

existing S02, I am inclined te award iL. The SOP was

 

promulgated by the Employer and, although the policy was drafled

in 1995 -~ prior to the State’s changing the detective's title

 

from “investigator” to “detective-Law and Public Safety”, the
policy has never been modified and is presumptively still in
effect.

However, the FOP apparently seeks to deviate from the SOF
as to the 30-minute meal break. The SOP provides tor a thirly-
minute unpaid meal break during an employee's eight and a half
hour shift. By its proposal to include a thirty-minmute paid
weel break into an eight-hour work shift, the FOP appears to be

seeking to reduce the Jength of the work day by one half-hour

 

per day. Alternatively, if the FOP is seeking to maintain the

The Union contends Lhal Lhe overtime and/or compensatory
time off policies utilized by the Division of Criminal Justice
are confusing and inequitabie to say the least. Of critical
importance, however, is the fact thal detectives do not receive

provided to detectives in the form of compensatory time off and

The State makes no particular argument in its brief with

together.

 

i find neither the FOr’s proposal nor the State’s propesal

te be satisfactory. First, the currenl SOP provides:

  

fa

 

A State investigator wor gq overtime shall e

compensatory hours for every hour of overtime. far

at the end of the work tesl period to be available for

Toe SOP does not distinguish the hours between hours in the

WEEKEND HOURS

that
detectives whe are required to work weekends shall be paid at

According to Neggia, many detectives assigned to certain

 

and/or narcoti

   

'S units are assigned a significant
nurkez of weekend and night hours. (3T127-123}. Moreover, Negaia
slaled that there are various scenarios wherein which @
celective might get “stuck” working overnight and/or on the

weekends. Given that Lhis varies from a typical detective’s

 

regular hours, the FOP believes these det

   

ctives should be
compensated at @ higher rale for such work beyond the “normal

call of duly.”
The FOP az

ues Lhat its proposal is more than zeasonakle

   

and should pe awarded. Quite simp_y, being required to work on

 

the weckends is atypical for the DCG detectives. Those
detectives who are required to do so should ke rightfully

compensated for the impact such work has on their personal

 

   

ives. ermore, many law enforcement units have @ similar
centract provision, providing the employees who perform such
work wilh an “enhanced” form of compensation. FOP should he

efforded the same benefit.

   

The State argues that there is ao provision in the STFA

 

contract which provides for State police be paid overlime

 

weekend work.

 

Although Lhe FOP perceives that working weekends is outside

ach “off

   

of detectives’ “normal workday”, I find that

 

assignments are typical for law enforcement ofLicers. act,
most employees with police powers work shifts which certainly

include evening shifts, overnight shifts, and weekend This is

 

widely considered an integral component of holding a job in law

enforcement. While some municipal police departments and county

 

corrections groups may still pay « differential for some shifts,

  

the concepl of shill difterentiul is no Longer a widely accepted
benefit. Further, T have not seen special compensation or a

ditterentia: paid “or weekend work, as such assignments are an

 

30
xpected part of a career in law enforcement. More importantly

 

Lhe FOP did not point to any contract law enforcement

 

cups which nays premium pay for weekend werk. The PO's

 

proposal is denied.

minimus of four (4} hours compensation, whether or not
the four (4) hours are worked, except when the end of
tne call-in period coincides with the beginning of

HOTEL STAY

 

@ FOP proposes,

   

In recognition of “Maggie's Law,” NeJd.S.A. 1-5,
the State understands that employees may be required
te work more Lhan Lwenly-four (24) conseculive hours
and, as such, because of the requirements of the law
such employees shall be afforded 2 hotel/matel room
without cost Lo the employee er driven home az the ond
ef their shift when it exceeds ‘weaty-Lour (24

The FCP argues that this proposal is consistent with “Maggio's

 

haw,” codified at N.J.S.A. 2C:1l-5. Mozeover, the propose! is
consistent with the Division of Criminal Justice Standard

March 1, 20C5. (FOP-32) Union's slaled intent for its prepesal

addresses only a small aspect of $OP-71 —-he provision

well as a detailed procedure Lor “replacing and relieving

shall ge into effect for this unit on July 1, 2015
or when the changes apply to other State law
enforcement collective negotiations units, excluding
Stale Police, whichever is later.

  

 

 

  

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

  

 

1. The State Health Benefits Program is applicabie
to employees covered by this Contract. It is agreed
that, as part of that program, che Stale shail
continue the Prescripzion Drug Benefiz Program
during the period of this Agreement to the extent it
is established and/or med. ed by ie State Health

The key difference in the two proposals is that the State

seeks to have any legislative changes go into offect

 

 

immediately, whereas the Union sceks to continue the benefits

clause for the length of the « uniess the contract

 

age is superseded by any such legislative changes.

 

I lind merit in the FOP’s argument. The terms of the

 

contract should remain in etfect for the contrast length uniess

changes are mandated by statute or the State Ieaith Benefits

 

Commissisn. If the legislature enacts changes Lo tae law and

makes such changes mandatoriiy immediately effective, then the

 

stalutory provisions i control. Tf the legislature exempts

 

tons, then the parties

 

current contracts from any amended prov.
current. contract provisions will continue. I award the Union's

3. Any legislative changes regarding post-retizement
medical benefits that mandate immediale changes to

The FOP argues that the cosl of living has increased over

this increase and seek to pay members = sufficient amount toward

 

the same. Consequently, this progosal is more than reasonable

asserts that this proposal is a benefit cost containment

al nor the Unien’

 

I find that neither the State’s propo!
proposal is entirely justified. As to Lhe Union's proposal to

increase the reimbursement levels, it must be noted that no

 

other bargaining unit in State government an eyecare

    

reimbursement rate of greater than the plan that currently

such costs. I am not inclined to give an increased benefit to

this is inconsistent with elke:

State contracts and ignores the possibility that some employees

permitting ceimbursement once in a two-year period is more

     

elude

 

ppropriate. Finally, I decline to i nguage that would

 

sunset. the clause upon the expiration of the contract. The

 

State's proticred reason that it wants the option to terminale

 

the program if it tlies in the face of collective

 

negotiations, is inconsistent with the provisions of other

 

contracts, and is not in the public interest, which favors

soliective negotiaticn over unilateral action. [ award the

Concerning the issue of vacation leave carryover, it

not mirror the existing practice. 1 intend to award the

 

existing practice as recited in SOP #6 as follows:

 

Vacation leave should ke taken during the calendar

in writen memorandum form, that he/she be granted
vacation carryover into the next year in cases where

The Union has multiple proposals on this subject:

 

If an Erpleyce cannct work due to an illness, injury
or infirmity, the employee shail be required to
present evidence in Lhe form of a certificate from a
licensed physician that he is unable to work after he

The

red no evidence or

 

Lestimony in support of its propesal to limit the circumsLances

in which DCd may request prool of illness. (J-8, Ite:

Nonetheless, the Union's proposais impermissibly limit the

t prool of ila

 

cumstances urcier which the State may req

   

from a unit member, and would be in violation of the governing

Civil Service regulation. As such, the Union's propesal cannot

 

awarded. On the other hand, the Slale’s proposal is taken
directly from the Civil Service regulation and should ke
awarded.

N.J.A.C.4A:6-1.4{d) (Sick leave procedures: State Service)

 

provides:

Addilionally, Lhe Stale’s proposal ig consistent with its

SOP 1-69 on “Sick Leave Usage,” {FOP-13), which has been in

MATERNITY LEAVE
The Union proposes the following clause:

Maternity Leave:
Employees shall be entitied to maternity leave
consistent with federal and state laws and regulations
with toe most liberal interprevation caking

The Union ergues that the Division has historicaliy

provided FOP members with such leave when necessitated. (3T-151-

 

155} FOP secks formal codification of Lhe same. The Union

 

avers that the members’ enlitlement to maternity leave should be

HOLIDAYS

The

 

ate and OP agree upon several provisions relating to
holidays. Specifically, the partics agree upon Lhe holidays

ed, and

 

ch are recognized, when certain holidays are celebrat

 

 

FOP members being granted a paid day off when the Governor
declares a paid day off by Executive Order. Where che proposals

diverge, however, revolves around three issues: (1) subsequent

 

amendmenls to the list of holidays; (2} whether detectives will

 

 

ic

 

fin the event the

 

granzed time o: verner grants a parlial

 

gay off; and (3) Lhe FOP

 

request lor double time in the event

3. Lf an employee is requiced ta work on one of tae

The State proposes the following Language:
2. The statutorily prescribed holidays, including any
subsequent. amendrenls thereto, shall be che holidays
recognized for purposes of this Agreement.

  

The FOP argues that the su

  

8 language pertaining to any

 

subsequent. amenduent of the holidays must be rejected. It
argues that, similar to the health insurance language the Stale
has proposed, an award of this language would allow the
compensation package given to FOP members Lo be unilaterally

red during the torm of a colleclive negotiations agreemel

Moreover, such a provision is not contained in any other

 

tions

 

collect

comparable State law enforcome
agreements. As a matter of comparability and fairness, Lhe
Union claims that the State’s proposed language should be
rejected.

The FOP maintains thal its request for double time

 

compensation if work is performed on one of the holidays is more

ban justified. As stated by Neggia, 2 comparable provision is

 

mtained in many collective negoviations agreements covering

 

ives. (3T-158-152} Moreover, working

Further, the State argues that the Union's proposal

concerning the granting of less than a full day off by the

 

Governor’s executive order mast be rejecled. Dee clearly and
succinelly stated the Szate’s rationale for oppesing this
proposal:

Finally, the State argues chat the union has presented no

 

in suppert cf its proposal that devectives who work a

holiday be compensated at twice their regular rate of pay

thousands of State employees covered by the regulations who work

these instances, the content of the execulive order will

conflicting language in the contracl on this issue

 

Finally, the Union proposes to be paid double Lime for

hours worked on a holiday. The record shows that there have

   

neen occasions when detectives have beer required to work on

State-declared holidays. Howe the Union is correct that

 

suck work is not part of their typical work schedul It is

 

noted that typicaily law enforcement efficers may be required to

   

© up their holiday off because of operational demands. In

 

such situations the employee does not have the benefit of the

holiday off to spend time wilh family and engage in leisure

  

pursuils. The employee should be appropriately compensated for
surrendering such Lime off to the needs of the State

Therefore, I wward a modified version of the Union's proposal to

read as Lollows:

 

3. If an employee is required to work on one of the
aforementioned holidays, the employee shall be
compensated at Lhe rate of one and a half times the

normal rate of pay.

 

UNION LEAVE TIME
The parties have submitted competing proposals regarding

The FOP argues that

straightforward. further, the decision and any conditions
imposed by the Office of Employee Relations shall be final. As
such, any concerns the Slate has and/or may have regarding Lhis

propasal have been taken into consideration. Finally, given

182
that the decision of Cffice of Employee Relations will be final

 

the sentence indicating that such approval “shall not be

are net denied without adequate justification

 

The Stale argues that the agreed upon provisions

proposals

 

The sccond major difference belween the patie:

concerns the appeal process of disciplinary charges lodged

 

 

against. 2 FOP member. The State proposes that disciplinary

charges (exclusive of terminalion) may be appealed in Linality

 

to a designee of the State Attorney General, who will issue @

proposed penalty in regard lo the same. FOP’s proposa! a!lows

 

disciplinary charges {alse exclusive of serminaticn! co provee

il is obvious FOP’s propasal is within the scope of

pertinent part:

such a proposal by POU is not mandacorily negotiable is contrary

The Union argues that a public cmployment disciplinary

be rejected.
The Stale moles that the Usion also seeks te have

“suspensions or fines of more than three days or for ar

Besides being incongruous with the rest of the provision, the

Layed.

 

Further, the State argues that while the State legislacure

consciously enacted the “45-day” rule for Stace and lecal

 

police, il did not do so for many categories oi law enforcement

 

personnel and in particular the “at-will” personnel at issue

Similarly, the Union provided no explanation or context Lor

The varties disagree aboul what discipline may be appealed

and whether it may be apgealed to binding arbitration. The

 

Commission Stale’s sight to terminate employees ard

 

 

cipline, may be without just cause and may not be

   

2014

     

appealed. In State of NJ, P.E.R.C. 59, the Commi

reviewed the scope of negotialions cf several of the FOP!

 

proposals and detexmined that Article 25 “Terminations” is
preempted. Tho Commission also determined taat Article 24

eclion A {Just cause} is nol mandatorily negotiable. Tk

negotiate over proposed Article 24, Sections B., C., K.1., and

informational ard do not interfere with mar

 

agerial prerogatives.

Finally, the Commissior found that, the extent the

 

proposals would authorize binding arbitration of minor
discipline, a negotiated aareement on that propesal would not

interfere wilh the Attorney General's statutory right to remove

First, the parties are in agreement as to the definitions

   

what a contractual grievance is as opposed Lo a non-

contractual grievance. However, under Paragraph B, which

 

defines the purpose of the grievance process, the divergence

 

between the parties proposals begin. Dontan testified that the
Gnier’s proposal would allow am individuai grievent Lo Eile a

grievance on his/her own behalf but would not permit the

 

individual to arbitrate the grievance without the Union’
authorization.
The FOP contends thet paregraph B(3) accomplishes this

will the

 

cums tani

   

purpose and maxes it ciear that ander no

 

FOP be compelled to bring a grievance te arbitration. Thie

language makes ily clear the FOP is the party thet

 

ate a

    

possesses the exclusive power and aulhority tor (1i

 

grievance; (2) move the same from step ta steps and (3) initiate

arbitration proceedings. Additionally, when reading Lhe purpose

isuses which would pluce Lhe OP's «ember,

notice thet thoy will cot be retaliated against and/or suffer

 

 

any reprisal for initialing a grievance under the term

Thece are few differences between the parties’ proposals ir

dares”, The

 

paragraph D, erlilled, “General Rules and Pro

Stale determines the grievance is not “omergen articulated

 

by the FOP, the pro stops, whereas FOR’s proposal provides

 

an avenue to apoeal the decision. If there is no process to

appeal a decision, the State wili always have the power and

 

authority te reject a request sade by the FOP.

The second major discrepancy in this paragraph pertains to

 

FoP’s proposai that resolutions and decisions at Step One and

itute a

 

Step Two of the grievance process shaii not cons
precedent in any manrer unless it is specifically agreed to by
lhe parties. Grievances are withdrawn and settled within the

three-step process for é myriad of reasons. For instance

 

232,
 

grievances are sometimes withdrawn and/or settied for issues

Le

 

with limeliness, witness availability, or tbe proots availa

for comsidereliva. The Usiva avers Lhat common sense dictates

 

that such a decision Lo settle or withdraw a matter should not

 

 

be precedent setting.

 

Under peragraph G, the State is again attemsting to remove

long-standing, accepted language that permits an employce to be

 

granted compensalory time off if @ grievance hearing exter

beyord the confines of the normal work day. Again, this

 

provision of the proposal was

orced to rush through the presentation of his/her evidence or

Lime constraints.

   

Placing this language in the
help prevent such a situation from occurring

Next, the FOP dees not object to designating the Caicf of

 

f as being the receiving party for a grievance Liled under

Slep One of the process. Additionally, there is no okjection to

 

 

the Stete Atiorney Genera! being named as the receiving party

for Step Two of the grievance process

     

@ KOP takes issue with Lhe Stato’s attempt to

- Conversely, the State's attempts to

The Stale argues that its proposed grievance procedure

 

where it differs from tac Union's, reflects a conscious effort.

   

Lo develop a process that dovelails with the operations ef the

vision and climinates vague and redundant language

 

The State urges the Arbitrator te adopt the State’s proposal as
written, In paragraph A(1}, the State proposal limits
“contractual grievances” to “express terms” which is an

appropriate ciarification of the parties’ intent to distinguish

    

between those disputes that may proceed to arbitratlon and th

ects to the

 

which will not. In paragraph B(1), the State ol

 

Union's attempt to absolve itself of any responsibility for

processing meritless grievances while simuit

Lhe Stale Lo process $8 position is a

Agreements between the Union Representatives

 

Representalives should stand on Lheir ewn. If a grievance

 

settlement reached it should not be subject to attack because

 

 

it is alleged to medify the terms of the Agreement. on

that the topics the Union lists do not apply to unciass:

anything useful to the Agreement; however, given the ianguage’s

(Modification of Union‘s Item “Fr”

 

 

The FOP notes that under the proposed Article cnlitled

“Transfers,” there are four paragraphs Lhe parli¢s disagree
about. First, under Paragraph C., the FOP proposes whut, if

transfer is effectuated, the member being transferred be

 

afforded a totel of ten days’ nolice prior to the same going

a
inte effec: unless the transfer is deemed an e

       

nergency by

management. There are Lhree primary locations where detectives

close to their residence. The Union argues chat

 

providing the detective wilh ten days’ noti

 

e, when po

 

ible, te
ensure that his/her personal life is in order is not oniy
reasonubie in his instance bul warranted as a matter of auman

decency.

   

vhe Union corlends that paragraph permit the

 

detectives to request to be Lranslerred once a year. Secend

  

paragraph G permits Pounit member Lo request a transfer at

 

ons so jong as the same are

 

y time for extraordinary re
detailed in the request. IL musl be noted that under boxh
paragraphs, there are no guaranLlees the transters will be
eftectuated. Therefore, other than the fact Lhat the transfer

e tine for

   

requests may Lake a minimam amount of administrat

 

the Chief of Deleclives and his staf# to consider, there is ae

plausible reason offered by the State as to why these proposals

  

should be rej

ched.

 

aragrapa E allows the FOP to grieve the procedural aspects

 

of che transfer proposal, wilh Lhe exception of providing

the ability to grieve a disciplinary Lransfer. The Union

 

acknowiedges =hat the kmployer has a managerial prerogative

transfer employces for operational needs. Therefore, the Union

5

does not seek the ability to grieve tac reasoning behind a

254
   

transfer. Nevertheless, the procedura? aspects pertaining to

sferred is . Based

   

how an employee may be tran negotiabie topi:

 

 

upon this, there should he no ccason the procedural aspects of

 

 

how an employee is transferred should not be subject to the

   

grievance procedures cf the collective negotiations agreement.

   

Finally, Donlan testified Lhal deLectives fave been

   

transferred in the past for disciplinary reasons. (17-131) In

 

 

particuiar, Conian testified Netective Jim Sweeney

 

involuntarily transZerred from the Northern Unit in Whippany t

 

  

the evidence facility in Hamilton. This resulted in a two-hour

 

commute each way for Sweeney. The Lrarsler was in response to

an alieged incident the State ulcimately determined required

 

discipline. In fact, shortly after the tran

 

effectuated, Sweeney was terminated from employment.

 

goth the State and FOP have propesed Lhe penallies that may

be imposed for discipline. in hoth instances, neither the State

 

nor the FOP proposed that transferzing an employee as an
acceptable penalty for a disciplinary offense. Based on the

foregoing and given the severe implications a transfer can have

 

 

a detective, if Loe transfer can be ked

 

upon Lhe Life
directly Lo a disciplinary aclion, FOP is requesting the right
lo contest such a transfer by grieving the same. If this
paragraph is exciuded from the collective negotiations

sate will have the unfettered ability to bypass

 

agreement,
 

the disciplinary process and transfer an individual for

dise

 

plinary reasons, withoul the same able to be challenged.

is a practice that is currently adhered to by the Div

shall not extend to any award for punitive damages
ultimately granted against the Detective or Non-

ERFECT OF LAW

The Slate proposes:

 

Savin

 

   

any provision of this Agreement shall conflict with an!

federal or State law or have the effect of eliminaring or

making Lhe Stale ineligibie for federal funding, that
specific provision of this Agreement shall be deemed
amended or nullified to conform to such law. ‘he onher
provisions of the Agreement shall nol be affected thereby
and shall continue in full force ard effect.

 

      

 

The POP proposes:

nflict with any Federal or State law, the
appropriate provision or provisions of this Agreement

    

 

 

shall be deemed amended or nullified to conlorm to
suck law in which event such provision may be
renegotiated by the parties.

     

The difference between the two proposals centers on the

phrase added by the State: “or have the effect of eliminating

or making the State ineligible for federa) funding.

   

vhe

"y

argues that its iznguage was taken dir.

 

tly from

 

the STFA conrract as weli as the collective negotiations

anything in either party's proposal Lhat wouid jeopardize

In the event that any provision of Lhis Agreement
shall conflict with any Federal or State law, oz have
the effect of eliminating or making the State
ineligible for federal fanding, the appropriate
provision or provisions of this Agreement shall be
deemed amended or nullified te conferm to such law, in

   

 

 

   

 

which event such provision may be renegotiated by the
parties.
This ‘composite’ language will give Lhe Slale ils desired

 

protection should some provision canse a loss in federal
funding, and yet permit the parties to renegotiate the disputed
provision.

The State’s proposal provides both parties the mutual right to

   

request negotiation over proposed new rules ard modification of

existing rules whereas the Union’s proposal gives that right

 

exclusively to the Union. The State argues that its proposal

282
also properly ties the parties’ negotiations obligalion to the

 

New Jersey Employee-Employer Relations Act, whereas the Union's

 

propose. wiles tue ubligation broadiy to the entivety of "the

appears to be a maintenance of benefits clause but

   

vague,

to “standards

and

 

atusing. The clause refers

 

ting at the time of the agreement” which are “relating te
the slatus of detectives of the Division of Criminal Justice.”

Nowhere in its proposal dees the Union define “status” or

 

“standards” as they are applied in this provision. Nor did the

    

Union proposal any testim explain its intent in making

 

this proposal.

The State asserts Lhat the Union's paragraph “C” is

 

likewise vague, amorphous, and ambiguot The State recogrizes

chat cerlain benefits referenced in the parties’ proposals are
