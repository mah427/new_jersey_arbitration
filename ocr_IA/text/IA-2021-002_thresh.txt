Vv. BACKGROUND

PBA Local 497 at one time represented a single bargaining unit consisting of
correctional officers and their superior officers employed at the Passaic County Jail as
well as Sheriff's officers who are given traditional police functions and responsibility for
operating the County Courthouse. Subsequently PERC certified four separate bargaining
units as follows: SOA the Superior Officers who supervise correctional officers in the
County jail and who are subject to this Award: Local 197 the correctional officers
themselves: Local 286 the Sheriff Officers and Local 286A the Sheriff Officer supervisors,

Traditionally, all four bargaining units negotiated in tandem, and the terms and
conditions of their respective CNAs were similar if not identical. In 2007, all four units
petitioned for an interest arbitration award in the same proceeding, The contract that
resulted from that proceeding expired on December 31, 2044. For the period January 1,
2015 to December 31, 2018, all four bargaining units bargained separately, but each
received identical wage increases. The most recent CNA for all four bargaining units
expired on December 31, 2019. However, of the four bargaining units only Local 286A
was able to reach an agreement with the County. The CNA between Locat 286A and the

County was ratified on or about January 30, 2020. This agreement was reached before

ee)
the effects of the COVID-19 Pandemic arrived in the United States. Subsequently, the
remaining three bargaining units petitioned PERC and requested interest arbitration.

This Award concems the SOA representing County Correctional Police Sergeants,
County Correctional Police Lieutenants, County Correctional Police Captains, County
Correctional Deputy Police Wardens, and County Correctional Wardens. The 49
members of the bargaining unit working in these titfes operate the Passaic County Jail
(‘Jail’). The members of the SOA bargaining unit supervise inmates, maintain care
custody and control of inmates, supervise and conduct searches of inmate cellsfiving
quarters; and investigate inmate related incidents. In addition to these tasks, the members
of the bargaining unit supervise subordinate officers, assist subordinate officers with
difficult inmates, develop and implement security plans for the facility; overseeing inmate
work activities, monitoring activities of inmates and staff, assessing inmates,
administering the correctional facility.

As a result of bail reform A.J.S.A. 2A:162-15 , the inmate population in the Passaic
County Jail has been reduced from approximately 800 to 500. Although there are fewer
inmates, the inmates who remain tend to be more prone to violence. In addition, members
of the SOA bargaining unit face heightened exposure to COVID-19.

In addition to their carcerat responsibilities, members of the SOA work with
members of law enforcement agencies, including Locals 286 and 286A and are part of
the Sheriff's Emergency Response Team ("SERT’).

The primary issues in this negotiation concem wages and health insurance
coverage. The County is self-insured and pays for most claims directly by utilizing a third-

party administrator. For many years, the County provided a Traditional Healthcare Plan

20
which was very expensive, and because of the requirements of Chapter 78 of the Pension
and Health Benefits Reform Law, the members of the bargaining were required to pay a
significant portion of the premiums to secure their health insurance. Both the Union and
the County are proposing to move from the Traditional Healthcare Pian to one of three
alternatives: Exclusive Provider Organization Plan ("EPO"), Point of Service Plan ("POS")
or a High Deductible Plan. As will be discussed, the Union contends that the savings
generated by terminating coverage in the Traditional Plan would pay for the Union's
proposed wage increases for its proposed five-year CNA. On the other hand, the County
contends that the move from the Traditional Healthcare Plan would result in reduced
premium contributions from members of the bargaining unit as required by Chapter 78.
VI. THE PARTIES’ DISCUSSION OF THEIR RESPECTIVE PROPOSALS

A. Union Proposals Regarding Wages Hours and Term of the Agreement and the
SOA’s Response to the County’s Proposals

The Union is seeking a five-year agreement, where each member of the bargaining
unit will be permitted to move annually one step on the Salary Guide. In addition, under
the Union’s proposal, superior officers at the top step would receive the following wage
increases: 4% retroactive to January 1, 2019; 4% retroactive to January 1, 2020; 3%
effective January 2021; 3% effective January 2022; and 3% effective January 2023.

Initially the Union notes that, its wage proposal is being made after the expiration
of the 2% hard salary cap contained in A.J.S.A. 34:13A-16.7(b).

As to compensation, the Salary Guide is compressed for members of the
bargaining unit. There are three steps in the salary guide for County Correctional Police
Sergeants, two steps for County Correctional Police Lieutenants and County Correctional

Police Captains, and one step for the County Correctional Police Deputy Warden and

21
County Correctional Police Warden. Under the current CNA, members of the bargaining
unit who reached the top-step of their respective rank moved off-quide and received cost
of living adjustments. The Union is not seeking to increase the value of any of the steps
in the salary guide. Therefore, under the Union's proposal the salary guide will have been
frozen for nine years. The Union is seeking the following salary guide for members of the
bargaining unit

Step 1 $106,879
Step 2 $115,200

22
The SOA points out that the Salary Guide was incorporated into the recently
negotiated Local 286A CNA with the County. (PBA 197A Ex. 20). In support of its position
that the members of the bargaining unit should receive the same wages as Local 286A,
the SOA notes that, unlike in other counties, the Passaic County Sheriff oversees both
Sheriff Officers and Correctional Officers. The SOA notes that it works closely with other
law enforcement groups, including Local 286A. President Rosario, testified that he was
concerned that the morale of members of the SOA would suffer if his members did not

receive the same wage increase as members of LOCAL 286A bargaining unit creating

 

unnecessary division.

In describing the County's wage proposal. the SOA concedes that the County is
also offering step advancement but notes that the County is only offering the following
wage Increases: 1% retroactive to January 1, 2019; 2,5% retroactive to January 1, 2020;
3% effective January 2021: 3% effective January 2022; and 2% effective January 2023.
The SOA notes that this is significantly less than the wages agreed to by Local 286A. The
Union posits that awarding the County's proposal would disrupt the long-established
practice of providing the same compensation to members of both the SOA and Local
286A bargaining units. The SOA cites to PERC decisions holding that a “public
employer's pattem of settiement is an important consideration in applying the nine interest
arbitration factors found under N./.S.A. 34:13a-16G. (Union brief at 54 citing. Union
County Corrections Officers, P.B.A. Local 999 v. County of Union, 30 NJP.E.R. 38
(2004); County of Essex and Essex County Sheriff's Officers, P.B.A. Local 183, 34

N.JP.E.R. 41 (2005).

23
The Union urges me to review the history of negotiations and the relationships
concerning wages and conditions of employment within the jurisdiction. The SOA notes
that at least since 1997, employees it represents received the same wage Increases as
members of the bargaining unit represented by Local 286A.

The SOA maintains that the County's wage offer is a substantial departure from
the history of parity between the SOA and Local 286A. The SOA posits that if] award the
County's offer it could lead to “competition” between the two bargaining units.

The SOA also notes that the Local 286A wage increases were generated alter
Local 286A agreed to eliminate the Traditional Healthcare Plan and the County was able
to count on significant cost savings. The SOA relies upon the testimony of its expert
Dominick Fanuele ("Fanuele"), Mr. Fanuele described the Traditional Healthcare Plan as
an “indemnity plan.” (1Tr. 95-96). He noted that the Plan permitted participants to use any
provider, and that there were low co-pays and very limited out of pocket costs. Mr.
Fanuele stated that such plans are extremely expensive. Mr. Fanuele compared the
monthly cost of coverage for each proffered plan. As an example, for a family the
Traditional Healthcare Plan's monthly premium is $3,694, the EPO plan premium is
$1873.35, the POS premium plan is $1697.12. and the high deductible plan premium is
$1642.672, (Union Ex. 9 internal Ex. B).

Mr. Fanuele concluded that, over a year's time, the EPO family coverage is
$21,848 cheaper than family coverage under the Traditional Healthcare Plan, and the

POS Plan is $23,963 less per year. As noted above, under Chapter 78, members of the

? although the County is self-insured it is still obligated to create an equivalent premium as if it were
purchasing insurance from an insurance company instead of being self-insured. This requirement is
necessary to comply with the Consolidated Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act ("COBRA"). (1T 100}.

24
SOA bargaining unit are required to contribute 36% of their health insurance premium
costs. Mr. Fanuele concluded that, overall if the members of the SOA bargaining unit
switched to the EPO Plan it would result in a savings of $282,289.68 in total premiums.
The members of the SOA bargaining unit would contribute $98,801.38, netting the County
an annual savings of $183,488.04. Similarly, if members of the SOA bargaining unit
switched to the POS Plan the County would save $203, 105.88. (1T 103-106).

Taking into account the purported savings attributable to the elimination of the
Traditional Healthcare Plan and based on the report of its expert Dr. Caprio, the SOA
contends that the cost to the County of adopting the Union's wage proposal is an increase
of $87,003.61 In 2019; a decrease of $42,398.97 in 2020; a decrease of $91,284.07 in
2021; an increase of $226,356.40 in 2022; and an increase of $237,108.54 in 2023.
(Union Ex. 4 internal Ex. A)

The SOA calculated the baseline salary to be $7,097,084.64 in 2018 and contends
that if its proposal were adopted this would represent a 5.83% increase over the life of
the five-year agreement or 1.17% per year. The Union, in part, includes verified breakage
- that is, the known retirement or separations of higher paid members of the SOA
bargaining unit — in its calculations. The SOA contends that its proposal is cost neutral.
The SOA also argues that the elimination of the Traditional Healthcare Plan is necessary
in order to maintain comparability between the SOA and Local 286A. The SOA posits that
Local 286A was able to secure an increased wage as a result of the elimination of the
Traditional Healthcare Plan.

The SOA points to Dr. Caprio's analysis of the County's ability to pay for its

proposal. The SOA contends that Passaic County has unused revenue capacity which

25
could easily fund the wage increase it is seeking. Based on Dr. Caprio’s analysis, the
SOA notes that property tax increases in the County have been modest, the tax levy has
been unchanged, the fund balance in 2020 is 70% larger than the fund balance in 2016,
and that debt service has decreased by an annual average of $6.5 million dollars from
2016 to 2020. The SOA asserts that its proposed wage increase would not have any
impact on the average residential property owner.

The SOA acknowledges that the County may raise other issues in favor of its
proposal, and the SOA contends that these issues should not stand in the way of my
awarding the SOA’s proposal. Initially, the SOA points to the Constitutional Officer's Cap,
N.J.S.A, 40a:4-45.45b, which limits increases to County Officer's — such as the Sheriff —
to 2% over the previous year's budget. The SOA states that the County did not submit
any evidence showing how the Constitutional Officer's Cap would be impacted by the
wage increase requested by the SOA. The SOA also notes that, since it is asking for the
same wage increase as Local 286A, the SOA posits that the County is not in a position
to contest the SOA's proposal. Moreover, the SOA contends that the Local 286A
agreement, because of breakage, is actually more costly than the SOA proposal

The SOA acknowledges that the County might argue that based on P.E.R.C.'s
decision in in the Matter of Borough of New Miford and P.B.A. LOCAL 83, P.E.R.C. No,
2012-53, | am precluded from taking breakage into account in issuing my award. The
SOA maintains that the breakage restriction is only applicable to interest arbitration
awards restricted by the 2% Hard Cap which has now sunset. (Union brief at 113-114
citing, MO Hopewell Township and Hopewell P.B.A. Local 342, Docket No. A-2019-016,

P.E.R.C, NO. 2020-10 (August 15, 2019) (A breakage analysis is discretionary with the

26
arbitrator). The SOA also notes that it is able to point to actual breakage and is able to
point to the real costs of its wage proposal.
a-1. SOA Discussion of the Statutory Requirements
i. interest and Welfare of the Public

The SOA recognizes that the interest and welfare of the public is a major criterion
required in analyzing an interest arbitration dispute. In support of its contention that its
wage proposal be granted, the SOA describes the difficulties and dangers faced by its
members and their contributions to public safety. The SOA notes that its members in
addition to facing the dangers of being a correction officer, members of the bargaining
unit also have administrative responsibilities for the Jail. The SOA points out that its
members are exposed to numerous health risks which have only been exacerbated by
the COVID-19 Pandemic. The SOA contends that because of its vital role in preserving
public safety and in ensuring the effectiveness of the correctional system that it should be
awarded its wage demand. In addition, the SOA contends that awarding its demand would
enhance morale within the bargaining unit.

In urging rejection of the County's offer, the SOA contends that the County's offer
does not take into consideration the importance of the work performed by members of the
bargaining unit, does not adequately compensate members of the bargaining unit; does
not take into account the significant economic concessions made by members of the
bargaining unit as a result of the 2% Hard Cap and Chapter 78; and would harm morale.
The SOA posits that the County's abllity to attract and retain qualified officers would be

negatively impacted if the County's offer were granted. The SOA also notes that because

27
of the requirements of Chapter 78, those members of the bargaining unit progressing
along the salary guide will then be contributing more for their health insurance coverage.

ia. The SOA’s Hazard Pay Proposal and the Public Interest

The SOA also argues that, consistent with the public interest, its hazard pay
proposal of in which it seeks payment of $80 per/shift plus $1 0/hour pay in overtime made
in response to the COVID-19 Pandemic should also be awarded. The SOA notes that
employees in the Preakness Healthcare Facility have provided with hazardous duty pay.
The SOA points to Morris County which has authorized its administrator to offer hazard
pay to certain employees. The SOA states that from the onset of the COVID-19
Pandemic, the members of the bargaining unit have worked under anxiety inducing
conditions. The SOA also asserts that this proposal could be funded through the Federal
CARES Act.

fi, Comparison of Wages and Benefits with Similarly Situated
Employees in Comparable Jurisdictions

The SOA notes that, in making their awards, Interest Arbitrators are required to
give substantial weight to the comparability criterion. Comparisons are made to:
employees in the private sector; employees in the public sector; employees with the same
employer and employees who perform same or similar functions with comparable
employers.

The SOA states that recent interest arbitration awards have hovered around 2%,
and the SOA attributes this to the effects of the Hard Cap. The SOA maintains that with
the removal of the salary cap its wage proposal is more in line with the County's proposal.

The SOA compares the salaries of members of the bargaining unit with those of

the municipal police forces in Passaic County and asserts that comparable officers,

26
excluding Deputy Wardens and the Warden, are better paid than the members of the

SOA bargaining unit. The SOA relies on the following table in order to make its

comparison:

The SOA notes that its proposal does not affect the salary guide, and that even if
its proposal was granted in full, members of the bargaining unit who have not reached the
top step would still lag behind simitarly ranked officers employed by municipalities in the
County. The SOA states that in 9 of the 16 municipalities sergeants at the top step would
still be paid more than sergeants in the bargaining unit, that lieutenants in ten of the 16
municipalities would be paid more than lieutenants in the bargaining unit, and that
captains in 6 of the 16 municipalities would be paid more than captains in the bargaining
unit. The SCA maintains that this analysis shows that awarding its wage increase would

permit the members of the bargaining unit to keep pace with their Passaic County peers.

30
The SOA also compares the salaries of the bargaining unit members to the salaries
of other correctional units in the state, and notes that the members of the bargaining unit
had formerly been in the top 5 in compensation, but that this is no longer true. The SOA
attributes this disparity to the effects of the 2% Hard Cap.

The SOA does not think that comparison with the County's other bargaining units
is warranted. The SOA notes that unlike the civilian bargaining units, the SOA bargaining
unit was subject to the 2% Hard Cap, and that this affected the compensation of its
members. The SOA also concedes that the salaries of members of its bargaining unit are
higher than the salaries of the civilian bargaining units but contends that such a
comparison is not appropriate because, the SOA bargaining unit members have more
difficult and dangerous jobs. The SOA urges me to reject a comparison of its bargaining
unit to the civilian bargaining units. (Union brief at 153-182 citing, Township of
Woodbridge and P.B.A. LOCAL 81, PERC No. IA-96-119 (1998)).

The Union aiso reiterates its contention that the most appropriate comparison is to
the recent CNA negotiated between the County and Local 286A. The SOA points to the
historical relationship between its contract's wages and benefits and those provided in
the Local 286A CNA. The SOA states that there must be a justification for issuing an
award containing such a departure from an intemal pattern of settiement history. The
SOA also maintains that its proposal actually costs less than the Local 286A agreement.

ili, Lawful Authority of the Employer
The SOA asserts that the County has not presented any evidence that the County

cannot lawfully agree to the Union’s proposals

31
iv. Financial impact Upon the Governing Unit

In reliance on the testimony of its expert, Dr. Ralph Caprio, the SOA contends that
the County has the ability to pay for the Union's economic proposals. The SOA also
contends that the County has not presented evidence that it Is unable to pay. The SOA
posits that its proposals are fiscally responsible and would not have a detrimental impact
on the County or its residents. In addition, the SOA concedes that revenues are down by
$8 million dollars as a result of the COVID-19 Pandemic, however the SOA notes that the
County has received $87 million dollars in CARES Act funding to mitigate the effects of
the COVID-19 Pandemic. The SOA also cites to the testimony of the County's Chief
Financiat Officer, Richard Cahill ("Cahill") who testified that the County will be able to
collect revenues to satisfy any budgetary demands. (Union brief at 216-217, citing 47116-
117).

The SOA asserts that the County is in excellent financial condition, and has the
ability to regenerate surplus, and has excess budget appropriations which, when unspent,
go into its reserves. The County's fund batance has more than doubled in the last four
years, and there have been only de minimis tax increases.

The SOA also asserts that the Property Tax Levy Caps would not interfere with the
abllity of the County's ability to raise income,

v. Cost of Living

The SOA also seeks support for its economic position by pointing to statistical
evidence that the cost of living in the County and in the surrounding areas has steadily
increased. The SOA states that over the past five years, the Consumer Price Index (“CPI”)

has increased 7.5% while the wages of those at the top step of the Salary Guide only

32
increased by 2.0%. Therefore, the SOA posits that the wages of members of the
bargaining unit have not kept pace with inflation,

The Union also reiterates its argument that in addition to the increased cost of
living, members of the bargaining unit are required to pay up to $14,185 toward the
premium for family coverage under the Traditional Healthcare Pian pursuant to Chapter
78. The Union contends that the County wage proposal is simply too low and would not
keep up with the expected increases in the cost of living

vi. Continuity and Stability of Employment

The SOA argues that if its salary proposal is granted, it would contribute to the
continuity and stability of employment among members of the bargaining unit and would
encourage the retention of competent and qualified superior officers. The SOA contends
that if the County's proposal is granted there would be an incentive for members of the
bargaining unit to leave the County’s employ and this would impose a cost on the
taxpayers who will have to pay for training replacement officers. The SOA asserts that if
its proposal is granted it would have a beneficial effect on morale.

vii, Statutory Restrictions

The Union points to Chapter 78 and the now expired 2% Hard Cap as having
restricted the ability of members of the bargaining unit to negotiate an adequate wage
package. The Union contends that, since these restrictions are no longer in place, | am
no longer confined to a particular mandate.

The Union argues that the award of its economic proposals would alleviate the
statutory restrictions resulting from the 2% Hard Cap previously applied to members of

the bargaining unit.

a-2 SOA Discussion of County Proposals

i. County Proposals Governing Shifts and Hours of Work

The SOA notes that the County is seeking to change the provisions of Article 5(A)
of the CNA governing the workweek. The first provision that the County seeks to modify
concems the following language: “All Employees employed in the continuous operation
of the Passaic County Jail Corrections Unit shall have a workweek, inclusive of two
weekends, consisting of four (4) consecutive days on and two (2) consecutive days off.”
(Emphasis supplied). The County seeks to eliminate the highlighted phrase “inclusive of
two weekends.” The SOA contends that were | to grant this proposal, it would be
disruptive to the bargaining unit's quality of life and would interfere with the family stability
of the members of the SOA bargaining unit.

In addition, the County has proposed that it be given the discretion to stagger work
shifts by two-hours. At present, members of the SOA bargaining unit work four days on
followed by two days off and work from: 7:00 AM to 3:00 PM, 3:00 PM to 11:00 PM, or
14:00 PM to 7:00 AM. While certain Superior Officers work five (5) days on and then two
(2) days off with a shift of 8:00 AM to 4:00 P.M., the SOA contends that this would wreak
havoc with its members homelives. SOA members have childcare responsibilities, and
the proposal as written would give unfettered discretion to allow the County to change
shifts without notice®. The SOA is also concemed that such discretion would be used to

discipline members of the bargaining unit.

* Undersheriff Dennis denied this was the intent.

34
i Overtime for the K-9 Unit

At present. the officers assigned to the K-9 Unit are provided with one half-hour
before their shift and one half-hour after their shift to care for their dogs. The County has
proposed that officers assigned to the K-9 Unit be given five compensatory days off
together with a take-home vehicle. The SOA notes that of the K- Unit are also on-call

The SOA rejects this change, because it contends that the members of the K-9
Unit would not be adequately compensated for the time expended caring for their dogs,
and for their on-call status.

Night Differential

 

Members of the SOA bargaining unit who work night shifts are entitled to a
differential. The County is seeking to add a provision to the CNA that states that if a
member of the SOA bargaining unit is on medical leave or is otherwise absent for forty-
five days, that officer will no longer entitled to the differential. The SOA rejects this
proposed change and contends that members should be entitled to their regular salary
even if they are forced to take an extended leave or utilize accrued sick time. The SOA
contends that this proposal is unjust and would be financially detrimental to the bargaining
unit members and their families.

iv. Holiday Compensation Check

The SOA rejects the County's proposal to reduce the compensation members
receive in lieu of holiday pay from 15 days to 14 days. The SOA characterizes this as an

uncalled for benefit reduction.

35
v. Medical Benefits

The County is seeking to make some changes to the medical benefits provision
set forth at Article 44A of the CNA. That provision currently provides limits on employee
deductibles and co-pays for prescription drugs and doctors’ visits. The SOA opposes this
proposal because it would remove the certainty that members of the bargaining unit can
expect to receive when they incur costs for the Doctor or pharmacist services.

The County seeks to eliminate retiree health insurance benefits. The SOA rejects
this proposal and contends that this will discourage qualified individuals from applying for
employment with the Sheriff's department.

vi. Miscellaneous (Work Projects)

The County presently utilizes members of the SOA bargaining unit to assist in
work projects on county roads by providing security. At present, § 15 L of the CNA
provides in pertinent part

The County of Passaic will continue the practice that, where

work projects are conducted on county roads and security is

required for traffic control, etc. the primary entity in providing

those services, will be SOA Local 197. The engineering

department will notify all contractors, when permits are

issued, to contact SOA 197 for their security needs.

The County proposes to substitute the PBA for SOA 197. The SOA asserts
that the proposal is ambiguous, and notes that there are at least four PBA locals who are

recognized by the County. Because of the confusion this proposal would engender. the

SOA asks that | not award this proposal.

36
B. County Proposals Regarding Wages Hours and the Term of the Agreement
and its Response to the Union’s Proposals
i. The Lawful Authority

The County points to the Constitutional Officers’ Cap which requires that
constitutional officers such as the Sheriff, shall limit their budget request to 2% of the
previous year's budget. The County notes the Sheriff's budget in 2020 was $2,102,506
and that 2% of that amount would equal $42,050.12. In addition, the County asserts that
as a result of the COVID-19 Pandemic, the Sherriff's department has only collected
$1,139,264 of its usual revenue and Is therefore running at a deficit.

i. The Cost of Health Insurance

The County notes that both it and the SOA have made proposals to eliminate the
Traditional Healthcare Plan. The County also acknowledges that Mr. Fanuele, the Union's
expert, testified that when the Traditional Healthcare Plan is eliminated, the savings
resulting from the members of the bargaining unit switching plans would result in savings
to the County of between $180,000 and $203,000 per year. However, the County asserts,
that since it is self-insured, these purported savings are only speculative, and it is unclear
what claims the County would face at any given time. The County notes, that while its
savings cannot be quantified, the members of the bargaining unit will receive savings as
a result of the reduction in their Chapter 78 contributions.

if. Compensation of the SOA Bargaining Unit

The County points out that members of the SOA bargaining unit have a median
income of $128,755.88, and that. when differentials and longevity payments are taken

into account, the average wage is $140,971.17, County Chief Financial Officer Richard

37
Cahill testified that the average income in the County is $60,681, which means that
members of the SOA bargaining unit earn significantly more than the average County
resident

The County stresses that members of the bargaining unit have significant
opportunities to eam overtime, and to receive generous longevity pay, and generous
vacation entitlements.

iv. Comparisons to Similarly Situated Employees

In comparing the salaries of members of the bargaining unit to private sector
employees, the County notes that there are few private sector occupations that pay as
well as positions in the bargaining unit that do net require a college education. The County
characterizes the SOA’s demands as unreasonable.

In comparing the SOA to other County bargaining units, the County cites the

following contract settlements:

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Union Term Increase
TBT 125 Years 14 1.25%

St year 1.5%
‘CWA 1032 3 years $1500 no step movement
District 15, IAMAW 1 year 0

Years 2-5 2%
‘CWA 1032 (security) Four years 1% or $1000 at max
OPEIU Local 153 2 years 2%

CWA 1032 (nutrition) a years 1.25% COLA

 

 

 

 

 

38
 

TBT 11 (blue collar] S years Step movement; $1500 at max

 

 

1199] (Supervisors an RNs and | 4 years No step movement 2.25% COLA
LPNsO
‘AFSCME 2252 (Supervisors) years No step movement 2.25% COLA

 

 

 

 

 

Based on these comparisons, the County contends that the SOA’s demands are not
reasonable and would deviate from the internal pattern of settlement.

v. Comparisons to other New Jersey Counties

The County notes that Passaic County ranked 13" out of twenty-one counties with
respect to total county income, and when considering average income alone, Passaic
County is the fourth lowest. The County also points out that, in 2019, the County had an
unemployment rate of 4.3%, and in September 2020 the unemployment rate was 8.6%.

vi, Comparison to other County Correction Contract Settlements

The County has reviewed some of the recent settlements concerning corrections
officers and argues that the SOA’s demands deviate from the statewide pattern. The

County points to the following:

 

 

 

 

 

 

County and Union Term Wage increase

Middlesex County Superior | 4 years 2%

Corrections Officers

Camden County Correction | 3 years, Tito base

Superior Officers

‘Camden County Rank & File 5 years 2%

Morris County Superior Officers [3 vears $3,205 added to base no step
year 1; 3% no step year 2; and
frozen year 3

Union County Superior Officers | 3 years 2.75% year 1; 2.5% year 2; .75%
year3

 

 

 

 

 

39
vil. The Cost of Living

The County suggests that the appropriate metric for measuring changes in the cost
of living is the C-CPI-U, because the traditional Consumer Price Index does not reftect
changes by consumers in their buying patterns or consumption habits‘. The County posits
that its wage proposal for the SOA bargaining unit provides average increases of 1.797%
in year one, 4.206% in year two, 3.239% in year three, 3.059% in year four and 1.99 in
year five for total package average of 2.858%. The County suggests that its proposal
would be in excess of the increased costs of living throughout the duration of the
agreement.

vill. The Interests and Welfare of the Public and Statutory Limitations

The County notes that | must consider the public’s interest in fashioning my award,
and that this analysis must balance the interrelationships considering all of the statutory
criteria. The County stresses that the COVID-19 Pandemic has had a deleterious impact
on the County's finances. Although it concedes that it has received funding under the
CARES Act, the County posits that | must reject the SOA’s hazard pay proposal because
CARES Act money is to be used for salaries of those whose jab duties include working
to mitigate the effects of the COVID-19 Pandemic. The County states that members of
the SOA bargaining unit do not fall into that category

In support of its economic position, the County urges me to note that
unemployment is now 8.6% in Passaic County. The County also points out that, at the
time of the hearing in this proceeding, revenues in this fiscal year were down by
approximately eight million dotlars, and that awarding the increases sought by the SOA

“\In its discussion of the cost-of-living factor, the County has not provided the actual change it contends is,
reflected in the C-CPI-U. (County brief at 36)

40
would impinge on the Sheriff's ability to increase his budget under the Constitutional
Officer's Cap.

ix. Stability of Employment

The County contends that its bargaining proposal should be adopted because it
will not have an impact on the continuity and stability of employment. The County asserts
that the members of the SOA bargaining unit have well-paying jobs with good health
insurance and pension benefits, and it is confident that members of the SOA bargaining
unit will not leave their positions.

x. The SOA’s Hazard Pay Proposal

The County rejects the SOA’s hazard pay proposal. The County concedes that it
has provided hazard pay to the employees of the Preakness Healthcare Center because
of the COVID-19 Pandemic. The County notes that employees of the Preakness
Healthcare Center are on the frontlines of combatting the COVID-19 Pandemic. The
County reiterates its contention that because the members of the SOA bargaining unit do
not have direct responsibility for mitigating the COVID-19 Pandemic, the hazard pay
proposal should be rejected. The County also posits that hazard pay is beyond the scope
of an interest arbitration proceeding,

Vil. DISCUSSION

a. Salaries and Term of the Agreement

Conceptually, the wage proposals of both the County and the SOA are very similar.
Both parties agree that a five-year term is appropriate, and both parties agree that there
should be annual step movement for those members of the SOA bargaining unit. Where

the parties’ analysis diverges concems the annual raise that they believe should be

ca
awarded to members of the SOA bargaining unit who are at the top step of the salary
guide. Even here both parties agree that the members of the bargaining unit should be
awarded a 3% wage increase in both 2021 and 2022. The following table shows the

differences between the parties proposals:

 

 

 

 

 

 

Year Union County
2019 4% 1%
2020 a% 2.5%
2021 3% 39%
2022 3% 39%
2023 3% 2%

 

 

 

 

 

The SOA points to the history of collective bargaining in the County and notes that it is
seeking the identical wage increases that the County voluntarily agreed to with Local
286A. The SOA states that the SOA has always received the same wage increases as
members of Local 286A bargaining unit, and the SOA asks me to adhere to the historical
pattern. In addition, the SOA asks me to take note that the elimination of the Traditional
Healthcare Plan will generate significant savings for the County.

On the other hang, the County asks me to take arbitral notice of the fact that since
the Local 286A agreement was reached in January 2020, the County's economy has
been harmed by the COVID-19 Pandemic, resulting in a shortfall in revenues, and an
increase in county-wide unemployment

Among the statutory criteria that | am obligated to examine. is the question of

comparability, N.J.S.A. 34:13-16(g)(2) provides:

42
Comparison of the wages, salaries, hours and
conditions of employment of the employees involved in
the arbitration proceedings with the wages, hours, and
conditions of employment of other employees
performing the same or similar services and with other
employees generally:

(a) In private employment in general: provided, however,
each party shall have the right to submit additional
evidence for the arbitrator's consideration.

{b) In public employment in general: provided, however,
each party shall have the right to submit additional
evidence for the arbitrator's consideration.

(c} In public employment in the same or similar
comparable jurisdictions, as determined in accordance
with section 5 of P.L. 1995, ¢.425 (C. 34:13A-16.2);
provided, however, that each party shall have the right
to submit additional evidence conceming the
comparability of jurisdictions for the arbitrator's
consideration

(d) In comparative private employment.

{e) __ In public and private employment in general

As Arbitrator Mastriani stated:

the first step is to determine whether there is a presence of
internat settlements that either follow strict terms or terms that
are so reasonably consistent with one another that an award
must fall within that reasonable consistency. If a “pattem” is
not found, the arbitrator is nevertheless required to consider
evidence of internal prior settlements under the criterion of
internat comparability. [N.J.S.A. 34:13A-16(g)(2)]. if a pattem
is found, the arbitrator must either find that there should be
adherence or explain why a deviation from the pattem is
justified.

JAM/O Township of West Windsor and P.B.A. Local Number 271, Docket No.: |A-2019-

014 (2019).

43
Here, the Local 286A bargaining unit is directly comparable to the SOA bargaining
unit. Historically, both bargaining units were members of the same local, and even after
PERC created four bargaining units, these four bargaining units negotiated together. and
previously petitioned for interest arbitration in one proceeding. Thus, comparisons to
private sector employees, other Passaic County employees, and other New Jersey law
enforcement personnel pale in significance to the comparison to the historic retationship
between the SOA and Local 286A. The Local 286A CNA was agreed to voluntarily by the
County as recently as January 2020. | also take notice of the fact that both the County
and the SOA have proposed eliminating the Traditional Healthcare Plan which will
engender significant savings for both the County and the members of the SOA bargaining
unit, However, while the savings that will be experienced by the members of the SOA
bargaining unit are quantifiable because their Chapter 78 contributions will be reduced,
the County's savings because it Is selfinsured, are more speculative, but they are
undoubtedly real

In addition, | am compelled to take into account the revenue shortfalls projected by
the County. However, Dr. Caprio’s testimony that the County is in relatively good financial
shape and is capable of raising funds under the tax levy cap is convincing. Although there
is no doubt that in the short-term revenue collections will be reduced, and the County can
experience a shortfall, Dr. Caprio's testimony has convinced me that the County can
withstand the significant salary increase requested by the SOA. | conclude that the
historic relationship between Local 286A and the SOA is so compelling that there is not
enough evidence in the record to depart from the historic pattem. | will award the SOA’s

proposal. Therefore:

44
Effective and retroactive to January 1, 2019, employees will move one (1)
step on the Salary Guide, and all of those employees at maximum will receive
a four percent (4%) cost of living adjustment in his/her salaries.

 

 

 

 

Effective and retroactive to January 1, 2020, employees will move one (1)
step on the Salary Guide, and all of those employees at maximum will
receive a four percent (4%) cost of living adjustment in his/her salaries.

 

 

 

Effective and retroactive to January 1, 2021, employees will move one (1)
step on the Salary Guide, and all of those employees at maximum will
receive a three percent (3%) cost of living adjustment in his/her salaries.

 

 

 

Effective and retroactive to January 1, 2022, employees will move one (1)
step on the Salary Guide, and all of those employees at maximum will
receive a three percent (3%) cost of living adjustment in his/her salaries.

 

 

 

Effective and retroactive to January 1, 2023, employees will move one (1)
step on the Salary Guide, and alt of those employees at maximum will
receive a three percent (3%) cost of living adjustment in his/her salaries.

Although | have discussed some of the salient statutory criteria, | will now

summarize the requirements of N.J.S.A, 34:13-16(q). The primary statutory requirement

is that the Award comports with the interests and welfare of the public. N.J.S.A. 34:13-

45
416(g}(1). This requirement must be read in conjunction with the remaining subsections of
NJS.A. 34:13-16(g).

As noted, in making this award, | have considered the financial difficulties that the
County is projected to face because of the COVID-19 Pandemic. | have nonetheless
concluded that the arbitral authority in favor of finding intemal comparisons is
overwhelming in this case, and | have therefore awarded the SOA’s proposals. Other
comparisons are also relevant, | note that while in the near term, members of the
bargaining unit will appear to progress relative to other Passaic County law enforcement
agencies, | would note that many of the comparators are working under long expired
contracts. Wayne which pays the highest salaries has not had a contract since 2044.
Other comparators are working under expired or soon to be expired contracts. One can
assume that the rates of pay will increase, and that they will meet or exceed the SOA
salaries.

In addition, the members of the SOA are receiving significantly higher wage
increases than Passaic County's civilian employees covered by collective negotiations
agreements. However, the nature of the SOA's work is directly comparable to the work of
the civilian employees. In addition, those employees were not working under the 2% Hard
Cap.

Regarding the lawful authority imposed on the Employer, as noted above the
County has stressed that the "Constitutional Officer Cap.” P.L. 2015 c, 249. restricts the
ability of the Sherriff to increase his budget by more than two percent per annum.
However, constitutional officers such as the Sherriff, have a broad range of discretion in

setting their budgets and in reallocating funds to operate and manage thelr offices under

46
the Constitutional Officer Cap. | would also note that unlike the 2% Hard Cap which
imposed rigid conditions upon an Interest Arbitrator’s ability to award an increase, the
Constitutional Officer Cap is a more fluid concept. Both the Constitutional Officer and the
arbitrator have more discretion under this cap. | accept the testimony of Dr. Caprio, that
the County is in good fiscal condition, and has a healthy fund balance and that the County
had excess statutory levy capacity. Dr. Caprio testified that under the Union's proposal
the increase in wages to the bargaining unit, and that the effect on the average Passaic
County residential property owner would be de minimis. Since the County has already
voluntarily agreed to an identical proposal with Locat 286A, | conclude that the County
has determined that the Constitutional Officer Cap is not a barrier to its operations. |
conclude that the County will be able to afford the increased costs emanating from this
award, and that there is no statutory impediment to this Award.

Regarding the cost-oftiving criterla, in 2018-2019, the cost-of-living in Northem
New Jersey, increased 1.7%, and for the twelve months ending November 2020, the cost-
of-living increased 1.4% - a difference that can be attributed to the COVID-19 Pandemic.
I conclude that this Award will allow the members of the SOA bargaining unit to keep pace
with cost-of living changes.

Finally, | conclude that this Award which largely awards the proposal sought by the
SOA in this proceeding, will not have a deleterious impact on the stability and continuity
of employment. There is no evidence in the record showing that employees in the SOA
bargaining unit are seeking employment elsewhere or that they are retiring in larger

numbers than usual,

47
b. Other Union Proposals
i. The Term of the Agreement
Both the SOA and the County requested a five-year term for the period January
1, 2019 to December 34, 2020, and that is awarded
i, Hazardous Duty Pay
As a result of the COVID-19 Pandemic, the SOA is seeking hazardous duty pay of
$80.00 per shift for members of the SCA bargaining unit. The SOA notes that employees
of Preakness Healthcare Facility have received such pay as a result of Federal CARES
Act funds paid to the County. | recognize that under the best of circumstances, the
members of the SOA engage in difficult and dangerous work, and that as result of the
COVID-19 Pandemic, their jobs have gotten immeasurably more difficult. However, the
CARES Act funding is not a stable source of income for the County and any further receipt
of such funding is dependent on the whims of Congress. | do not have the power to direct
the County to allocate these funds in the manner suggested by the SOA. I do not award
this proposal.
iff, Traditional Health Plan
Both the County and the SOA have proposed eliminating enrollment in the
Traditional Healthcare Pian and requiring members of the SOA bargaining unit to exit the
Traditional Healthcare Plan as of January 1, 2021. This proposal is awarded and shall go
into effect within 30 days of the execution of this award, or as soon thereafter as

practicable.

48
¢. Other County Proposals
i. Work Week and Hours of Work
Presently, some members of the SOA bargaining unit work a schedule which is
inclusive of weekends and consists of four consecutive days on and two consecutive days
off. The County proposes to eliminate the language regarding weekends. The County has
not come forward with sufficient evidence justifying such a change in the schedule. | find
that, the change in schedule proposed by the County would have a deleterious effect on
the domestic arrangements of the members of the SOA bargaining unit. Therefore. | do
not award this proposal
In addition, the members of the SOA bargaining unit work set 8-hour shifts. The
County has proposed that it be empowered to stagger these shifts by as much as two
hours without notice to the members of the SOA bargaining unit. This would interfere with
the domestic arrangements of the members of the SOA bargaining unit and would
undermine the provisions setting shift schedules. | do not award this proposal.
i Overtime
The County presently pays members of the K-9 Unit one hour per day to care for
and feed the dogs in their charge. The County seeks to eliminate this provision, and
instead provide the members of the K-9 Unit with five compensatory days. The County
has not come forward with sufficient evidence to justify this change, and | do not award
this proposal.
iff. Holiday Compensation
The members of the SOA are provided with 15 compensatory days In lieu of

holidays. The County is seeking to reduce the number of compensatory days to 14 in lieu

49
of holidays. The County has not come forward with sufficient evidence to justify this
change, and | do not award this proposal.
