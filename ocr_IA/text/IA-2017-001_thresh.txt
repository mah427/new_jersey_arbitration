INTEREST ARBITRATION AWARD
BACKGROUND

On July 29, 2016, the Hopewell Township Superior Officers Association
(‘SOA’) filed a Petition with the Public Employment Relations Commission
to initiate interest arbitration over its successor collective negotiations
agreement with the Township of Hopewell (‘Township’). The previous
agreement expired on December 31, 2015.

On August 4, 2016, | was appointed to serve as interest arbitrator by a
random selection procedure pursuant to NJ.S.A. 34:13A-16(e)(1}. This statutory
provision requires that an award be issued within 90 days of my appointment.
By letter of August 11, I scheduled a mediation session for September 27, 2016
and directed each party to submit a final offer no later than September 19 in
accordance with N.J.S.A. 34:13A-16(f)(1). On September 19, the Township
submitted its Final Offer. The same date, | granted a two-day extension of time ta
the SOA to file its Final Offer. The SOA did so on September 20. Subsequently,
the Township objected to the late submission of the SOA’s Final Offer and
moved to have it stricken from the record. This motion was denied on the
record at hearing.

On October 4, 2016, | conducted an interest arbitration hearing at the
Township’s Municipal offices. The Township and SOA each submitted

documentary evidence and testimony. A stenographic record was made of the
hearing, the transcript of which was produced on October 7. The Township
submitted lists of unit employees for 2015, together with their dates of hire,
rank, and their total base pay paid for 2015. The SOA stipulated to the
accuracy of this list and to base year costs. Post-hearing summations were
filed by October 17, 2016.
PROCEDURAL ISSUES

Fina! Offers

By letter of August 11, | directed each party to submit a Final Offer no later
than September 29. On September 19, the Township submitted its Final Offer.
The same date, | granted a two-day extension of time to the SOA to file its Final
Offer. The SOA did so on September 20. The Township objected to the late
submission of the SOA’s Final Offer and moved to have it stricken from the
record

NLS.A. 34:134-26(F}(1) provides,

f.{1) Ata time prescribed by the commission, the parties shall

submit to the arbitrator their final offers on each economic and non-

economic issue in dispute. The offers submitted pursuant to this

section shall be used by the arbitrator for the purposes of

determining an award pursuant to subsection d. of this section.
{emphasis added).

 

NJ.A.C, 19:16-5.7 {g), Conduct of the Arbitration Proceeding, provides in relevant

part,

(g) ... Atleast two days before the hearing, the parties shall submit to
the arbitrator and to each other their final offers on each economic and

noneconomic issue in dispute. The parties must also submit written

estimates of the financial impact of their respective last offers on the

taxpayers as part of their final offer submissions. The arbitrator may

accept a revision of such offer at any time before the arbitrator takes

testimony or evidence. .. (emphasis added).

In addition, subsection 19:10-2.1 (c), provides,

{c) Regarding extensions of time, the commission or officer having

authority to dispose of the matter, may, for good cause shown,

extend any time prescribed in these rules
Under this last rule section, as the “officer having authority to dispose of the
matter”, | have the authority to grant extensions of time for submissions,
especially when it is not beyond the two-day limit as set forth in subsection 19:16-
5,7 {g}. Here the Union was granted an extension and filed one day after the
Township. It’s submission on September 20 was two full weeks prior to the
interest arbitration hearing, Therefore, there being no showing of prejudice to
the Township, | denied the Township's motion at hearing to strike the Union’s

Final Offer from the record

Post-Hearing Submission of Additional Exhibit

 

The hearing concluded in this matter on October 4, and a briefing period was
established. Briefs were due close-of-business October 27. On October 17, but
prior to the briefing deadline, the Township submitted an additional exhibit and
requested that it be included in evidence. The SOA objected to this submission

and argued that the hearing record was already closed and its brief already filed.
By letter of October 18, | advised the parties that | intended to permit the
Township to supplement its factual record with the additional exhibit which is a
Memorandum of Agreement for a successor contract with CWA covering white-
collar employees and signed by the parties on October 17. Finding that the
additional exhibit was not available before that date, and was potentially relevant
to the Township's position on several issues in dispute here, | admitted the exhibit
into the record. However, to avoid any possible prejudice to the Union’s ability to
respond, | provided the SOA with a four-day opportunity to address the issue in a
supplemental brief. The SOA subsequently advised me that it would rely on its
original brief and declined to file a supplement.
FINAL OFFER OF THE TOWNSHIP?
The Township submitted the following final offer:

Term of Agreement:

Three years, commencing January 1, 2016 through December 31,
2018. Dates in the expired Agreement shall be changed as.

The Township also seeks to amend the dates in the expired
agreement to comport with the terms of the new agreement.

Article 9, Insurance Protection:

The Township proposes to reform the language in paragraph A?

("Medical Insurance”) as follows?:

Bracketed language indicates the proposed deletion; underlining indicates proposed new language.

> The Township's original offer submitted on September 19, referred to the deletion or modification of nine
sentences in the Medical Insurance subsection. On October 18, | advised the Township by email that its Final Ofter
did not cosollate to the SOA existing contract language under the Medical Insurance subsection as this subsection
only contained seven sentences, not nine. Therefore, clarification was requested, The same date, the Township
As of the date of the execution of this Agreement by the parties,
the Township shall provide major medical, hospitalization, life
insurance protection, dental and vision care. [Each full-time
employee shall pay a portion of the medical premium as directed
by P.L. 2011 C.78, and where appropriate, for dependent

term of this agreement, Employees shall continue to pa
contributions toward health care premiums as provided in Public
Laws 2011, Chapter 78

 

 

 

iv. The Township shall pay the full premium for each full-time
employee, and where appropriate for family plan insurance
coverage.

v, Amend fourth sentence in the expired agreement to provide:

The Township reserves the right to [may] change health insurance
benefit carriers at its discretion provided such change [of coverage]
will provide substantially the same level of benefits for bargaining
unit employees [be equal to or better than the coverage previously
enjoyed.]

 

 

The Township will provide at least forty-five (45] days’ notice to the
employees of any change in carrier.

[The Association and the Township agree that members will receive
medical services within the insurance carriers of Blue Cross/Blue
Shield of New Jersey under Blue Select “Preferred Provider
Organization” and/or Horizon Direct Access (HDA). The co-payment
for doctor’s visits (HDA and PPO) shall be fifteen dollars ($15).]

All full-time employees shall receive medical, hospitalization and
prescription coverage through the employer, The base plan provided b
the Township shall be the Direct Access 20/30 Plan (the "Base Plan’).

 

 

 

submitted a clarification of its Final Offer concerning this proposal. The SOA objected to this submission on the
basis that parties are not permitied te amend Final Offers atter the close of the hearing, On October 20, ladvised
the parties that | considered the clarification necessary so that the Township's Final Offer could be put into the
context of this record. However, I simultaneously disallowed any proposed modifications to the substance of the
Township's Final Offer.
Existing employees may elect to enroll in the current Horizon Blue Cross-
Blue Shield PPO Plan (PPO 15), or Horizon Direct Access 15 Plan*

however, any cost in excess of the Base Plan premium shall be paid by the
employee. The Township shall pay the full premium for each full-time
employee, and where appropriate, for dependent insurance coverage,
subject to employee contributions pursuant to Public Laws 2011, Chapter
78, and any employee contribution towards the payment of the additional
premium for premiums in excess of the Base Plan. Effective January 1,
2017, all new employees shall be enrolled in the Direct Access 20/30 Plan.

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

The co-payment for dactor’s visits (HAD and PPO) shall be fifteen
dollars ($15)

Paragraph C, Prescription Drug Insurance:

 

[The Township shall provide a Prescription Drug Plan for each full-
time employee, and where appropriate, dependents with a co-
payment provision of seven dallars and fifty cents ($7.50) for
generic and fifteen dollars ($15) for brand name drugs. The mail
order co-payment will remain the same. Each full-time employee
shall pay a portion of the applicable premium as directed by
P.L.2011c.78, and where appropriate for dependent insurance
coverage.]

The Township will provide far each regular full-time employee
fully paid medical insurance, subject to employee contributions
pursuant to Public Laws 2011, Chapter 78, and any employee
contribution towards the payment of the additional premium for
premiums in excess of the Base Plan, including a prescription drug
plan with a $5/$10 retail store co-pay (generic/brand name) and
with a $3/$3 mail order co-pay (generic/brand name); Direct
Access 20/30 will be $10 generic/$25 brand name. There will be
no formulary. Office visit co-pays shall be $10 for employees in
the EPO plan and PPO plan, and $20 primary care/$30 specialist
for Direct Access 20/30.* The 20/30 Plan shall be the Base Plan

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

The above recited language was included in the Township's revised Final Offer submitted on October 18.

This sentence appears to refer to medical insurance rather than prescription are and shall be considered in my
analysis if the medical insurance. In addition, it appears that the Township erroneously referred to the current
plans as PPO 10 and EPO which is inconsistent with the record evidence, The actual existing plans available to
employees in this bargaining unit are the PPO 15 Plan and the Direct Access 15 Plan.
and any prescription costs between the Base Plan and the PPO
and EPO plan shall be paid by the employee.

 

 

Paragraph G, Waiver of Medical Benefits:

 

The Township proposes to delete this entire subsection as follows:

[Unless otherwise required by applicable law, any employee who is
eligible for health care coverage and elects to waive the coverage by
the Township, shall receive an annual amount (to be paid on per pay
basis} which shail not exceed 25% or $5,000, whichever is less of the
amount saved by the Township. (N.J.S.A. 40A:10-17.1}. An employee
who waives coverage shall be permitted to resume coverage under
the terms and conditions as applied to initial coverage if the
employee ceases to be covered through the employee's spouse for
any reason, including, but not limited to, the retirement or death of
the spouse or divorce.]

which the public employer is a county or a municipality, the
arbitrator or panel of arbitrators shall take into account to the
extent that evidence is introduced, how the award will affect
the municipal or county purposes element, as the case may
be, of the local property tax; a comparison of the percentage
of the municipal purposes element, or in the case of a
county, the county purposes element, required to fund the
employees’ contract in the preceding local budget year with
that required under the award for the current local budget
year; the impact of the award for each income sector of the
property taxpayers on the local unit; the impact of the award
on the ability of the governing body to (a) maintain existing
focal programs and services, (b) expand existing local
programs and services for which public moneys have been
designated by the governing body in a proposed local
budget, or (c) initiate any new programs and services for
which public moneys have been designated by the governing
body in its proposed local budget.

(7) The cost of living.

(8) The continuity and stability of employment including
seniority rights and such other factors not confined to the
foregoing whichare ordinarily or traditionally considered in
the determination of wages, hours and conditions of
employment through collective negotiations and collective
bargaining between the parties in the public service and in
private employment.

{9} Statutory restrictions imposed on the employer. Among the
items the arbitrator or panel of arbitrators shall assess when
considering this factor are the limitations imposed upon the
employer by section 10 of P.L. 2007, c. 62 (C.40A:4-45.45).

In addition, N.J.S.A. 34:13A-16.7(b) provides

An Arbitrator shall not render any award pursuant to section 3 of
P.L.1977, ¢.85 (C.34:134-16) which, on an annual basis, increases
base salary items by mare than 2.0 percent of the aggregate amount
expended by the public employer on base salary items for the
members of the affected employee organization in the twelve
months immediately preceding the expiration of the collective
negotiation agreement subject to arbitration; provided, however, the
parties may agree, or the arbitrator may decide, to distribute the
aggregate money value of the award over the term of the collective
negotiation agreement in unequa! annual percentages (emphasis
added).

 

 

 

In arriving at the terms of this award, I conclude that all of the statutory

factors are relevant, but not all are entitled to equal weight. It is widely
20
acknowledged that in most interest arbitration proceedings, no single factor can
be determinative when fashioning the terms of an award.

In addition, | note that NJ.S.A. 34:134-16g (8) requires consideration of
those factors ordinarily or traditionally considered in the determination of
wages, benefits, and employment conditions. One such consideration is that
the party proposing a change in an employment condition bears the burden of
justifying the proposed change. Another consideration is that any decision to
award or deny any individual issue in dispute, especially those having economic
impact, will include consideration as to the reasonableness of that individual
issue in relation to the terms of the entire award. | am also required to
determine the total net economic cost of the terms required by the Award.

In this matter, the interests and welfare of the public must be given the
most weight. It is a criterion that embraces many other factors and recognizes
the interrelationships among all of the statutory criteria.

Among the other factors that interrelate and require the greatest scrutiny
in this proceeding are the financial impact of the award on the Employer's
budget and the taxpayers [N.J.S.A. 34:13A-16g(5) and N.J.S.A. 34:13A-16g(9)];
the stiputations of the parties; and the comparison of wages, other compensation
and benefits of the Township's police officers to other Township employees and

municipal police officers in the County.
DISCUSSION
Duration of the Agreement:

The SOA seeks a two-year contract commencing January 1, 2016 through
December 31, 2017. The Township seeks a three-year contract commencing
January 1, 2016 through December 31, 2018.

The SOA argues that it proposes a two-year agreement because the
Interest Arbitration Act includes a sunset provision of key elements at the end of
2017. The Union anticipates that there will be numerous changes in the Interest
Arbitration Statute which will affect the employees’ rights beyond 2017. Second,
the Union notes that its proposed alternative to the Township’s change in
medical insurance pian is the creation of a “Plan Design Committee” together
with a timeline for that Committee to explore alternative forms of coverage and
make recommendations to the governing body. The SOA notes that a two-year
agreement will give the Committee a chance to accomplish its goals and get the
parties back to the negotiations table by the end of 2017. This will permit the
Township to have the opportunity to re-examine the health care coverage plans
sooner rather than later.

The Township contends that a three-year agreement will provide a longer
period of stability as well as an economic predictability for the Township’s

budgetary process. The Township notes that itis already nearing the end of the
22
first year of any new agreement and a contract expiring in 2017 would only mean
that the parties would have to return to the table next fall, In addition, the
Township notes that traditionally, its collective agreements with all of its
bargaining units, both police and three civilian units, have contemporaneous
expiration dates, Moreover, its agreements with all units have traditionally been
for a three-year period.

Township Administrator/Engineer Paul Pogorzelski, testified that he had
two issues with the proposed two-year contract. First, he stated that the
Township and all of the Township's bargaining representatives have worked hard
over the past several rounds of bargaining to have all contracts terminate
coincident with one another. He stated that presently the Township has the
flexibility to holistically look at the fiscal position of Hopewell and can structure
its offers accordingly to the other contracts that are terminating at the same
time. Secondly, Pogorzelski attested that a two-year contract would expire soon
and the Township would have to start the negotiation process again in just a few
months. (1T-154-155).

| award a three-year contract. Having modified the Union’s proposal to
submit the health benefit plans to a design committee in a limited period of time,
| am not persuaded that a two-year agreement would be in the interest of the

parties or the taxpayers. Negotiations are time-consuming and costly. They also
tend to distract from the Employer's organizational mission. A longer contract
will insure that the parties will not have to return to the bargaining table in 2017
to start the process again. A three-year contract is also consistent with the
Township's intent to again have all of its labor agreements expire
contemporaneously in 2018, This creates a level playing field in which all of the
Township's bargaining units are competing to the same Township resources
simultaneously and it permits the employer to better project its financial
obligations for a longer period. Weighing these reasons against the Union’s
desire to be able to possibly escape the 2% arbitration cap when Chapter 105
expires, | find in favor of a contract that extends through 2018.

| award a three-year contract covering the period January 1, 2016 through

December 31, 2018.

 

The SOA seeks 2% across-the-board increases for each year of the new
contract effective January 1 of each year. It notes that all members of the SOA
unit are at the maximum pay step and all sergeants have already reached
maximum longevity amounts; therefore, the full amount of the 2% may be
applied to salary increases for the SOA members. it also seeks to maintain the
existing longevity plan.

The Township offers a 2% across-the-board base pay salary increase for
each year of the new contract, inclusive of all pensionable compensation
(longevity, stipend). In addition, the Township proposes that all salary increases
shall be effective and retroactive to January 1 of each year of the new contract.
Further, it seeks to grandfather longevity for existing employees, but eliminate all
longevity for new employees hired on or after January 1, 2017.

The current salary scale for superior officers is as follows: (E-2)

 

Title 2013 2014 2015
Sergeant 1 | 110,320.10 | 112,526.50 | 114,777.03
Sergeant 2 | 113,750.16 | 116,025.16 | 118,345.67

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Any sergeant with less than one year intitle is paid at the sergeant 1 pay
scale. On his/her first anniversary date, he/she moves to the sergeant 2 pay
scale. Currently, all the SOA officers are at the sergeant 2 pay and are maxed
out at $2,000 longevity each. (E-1)

In 2015, total salaries for the police superior officers in Hopewell Township
was $481,972 while the total 2015 salaries for rank and file police officers was
$2,264,367 for a combined total of $2,746,339. This represents approximately
38% of the Township’s total budgeted salary and wages for 2016 (E-17, Sheet
3b(1), p. 17}. The Union points out that the total salaries for the police officers
and sergeants combined only amounts to approximately 2.58% of the Township's
total tax levy of $106,156,844. It is apparent that the proposed 2% salary

increases will have a minimal impact on the taxpayers of Hopewell.
For the SOA bargaining unit, the parties have stipulated that the total base
pay paid for base year 2015 was $481,972. Calculating the 2% “hard cap” on that
base, and allowing for compounding from year-to-year, yields a total cap amount
of $29,501 over the term of a three-year contract.

The parties have agreed upon a two percent “all in” increase in each year of
the successor contract. The SOA proposes that the sergeants receive two
percent added to their base pay effective January 1, 2016 and again a two percent
increase added to base pay effective January 1, 2017. There is no cost to move
sergeants up on the salary guide, as all unit employees as of December 31, 2025
were at the top rate of “sergeant 2”. There are also no costs far longevity
increases as all unit employees as of December 31, 2015 were at the maximum
longevity rate of $2,000

The Township appears to argue at hearing that the cost of moving Sergeant
Tulko, who was promoted into the SOA unit on April 11, 2016, from the “sergeant
1” pay rate to the ‘sergeant 2” pay rate in 2017 must be included in the 2% overall
increase to the SOA unit. This runs counter to PERC’s instruction in Borough of
New Milford, P.E.R.C. No, 2012-53, 38 NJPER 340 (41116 2012), wherein the
Commission first established the principle that costs of increases are to be applied
using the bargaining unit census as of the last day of the base year (here, 2015),

and carrying those unit members through the successor awards. The bargaining
unit is therefore, not to be credited for savings through retirements, nor is it

debited for the costs of new hires or promotions.

The cost of the annual 2% salary increases for the SOA unit is as follows:

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Year 2%
ATB
2016 | 9,468
2017 | 9,829
2018 | 10,025
Total | 29,322

 

| award the following:
Effective January 1, 2016; 2% salary increase for all unit employees
Effective January 1, 2017; 2% salary increase for all unit employees
Effective January 1, 2018: 2% salary increase for all unit employees
This award is consistent with the stipulations of the parties and is within the
Township's municipal levy cap and appropriations cap. Itis also in the public
interest as the impact to the taxpayers is minimal
Longevity Benefits:
Article 14, Section C, “Longevity”, of the existing SOA contract provides as
follows:

Effective January 1, 2008, the longevity pay plan for the SOA shall provide
the following

1. Employees having ten (10) to fifteen (15) years of service with the
Township of Hopeweli shall receive an annual longevity payment of
One Thousand Dollars ($1,000.00), which shall be added to the
Employee's base pay and which shall be payable via the payralt
biweekly system. Salary adjustments shall be calculated on the
Employee's base pay, exclusive of longevity pay.

2. Employees having fifteen (15) to twenty (20) years of service with
the Township of Hopewell shall receive an annual longevity payment
of One Thousand Five Hundred Dollars ($1,500.00), which shall be
added to the Employee's base pay which shall be payable via the
payroll bi-weekly system. Salary adjustments shall be calculated on
the Employee's base pay, exclusive of longevity pay.

3. Employees having twenty (20) or more years of service with the
Township of Hopewell shall receive a flat longevity payment of Two
Thousand Dollars ($2,000.00), which shall be added to the Employee's
base pay and which shail be payable via the payrall biweekly system.
Salary adjustments shall be calculated on the Employee's base pay,
exclusive of longevity pay.

The Township argues that its rationale for seeking to eliminate the longevity
benefit for new hires is tied to the “Best Practices Questionnaire” required to be
completed by New Jersey State Department of Community Affairs (DCA).

DCA’s Local Finance Notice 2016-13, CY 2016/SFY 2017 Best Practices
Inventory, E-81A, provides the following:

The State's fiscal year 2017 Appropriations Act (P.L. 2016, c.10}
requires the Division of Local Government Services (‘Division’) to
determine whether some portion of a municipality’s CMPTRA and
ETR aid will be withheld?” based on the results of a Best Practices
Inventory (‘inventory’) to be completed by each municipality. The
inventory encourages municipalities to embrace practices that
promote financial accountability, sound management and
transparency. The Local Finance Notice provides guidance on how
the Division will implement this statutory requirement.

!°The LFN also states that as in previous years, the maximum amount of aid that is subject to
withholding is the full amount of the final aid payment.
28

Borgos testified that in 2015, the State’s Best Practice Inventory consisted of
50 questions which focused on the manner of “best practice(s)” in which its
municipalities should be operating. She explained that, in most cases, there were
four potential answers to the questions: yes, no, not applicable, or prospectively.
Borgos stated that if one answered yes, prospectively or not applicable, one
would receive full credit; and if one answered no, one would not receive credit.
Overall, the municipality had to score at least 80% credit to receive its full amount
of State aid at the end of the year. (1T-117-118)

State aid for the Township in 2016 was anticipated at $1,601,563 for the
Energy Receipts Tax; along with $32,594 for the Garden State Trust Fund, for an
overall total of $1,634,157 in State Aid for 2016. Identical amounts were
budgeted far and realized by the Township in the 2015 budget year. (E-17, Sheet
5)

The Best Practices Inventory for CY2016/SFY2017 consists of 30 questions.
Prospective answers are no longer permitted. The only permissible answers are
“Yes”, “No”, and, for a limited number of questions, “N/A” (not applicable).
Municipalities must receive positive credit on a minimum of 22 questions in order
to avoid withholding of aid. (U-81A). The guidance goes on to provide,

Given the introduction of several new questions and the reduced
overall number of questions, the Division reserves the right to

determine withholding percentages upon receiving all completed
CY¥2016 Best Practices Inventories.
The worksheet is segmented into the foliowing categories: (E-81)

- General Management

- Finance and Audit

- Procurement

- Budget Preparation and Presentation
- Personnel

- Health Insurance

There were no questions on the 2015 DCA survey which pertained to
longevity. However, the 2016 survey included the following questions concerning

longevity (E-81):

28. Has your municipality adopted an ordinance, resolution,
regulation or written policy eliminating longevity awards, bonuses or
payments for non-union employees?

29. For any employees covered by a collective bargaining
agreement, has your municipality eliminated all tongevity awards,
bonuses or payments for employees hired on or after a specified
date, and refrained from increasing any tongevity awards, bonuses or
payments for employees hired before a specified date? The answer
to this question can be “N/A” if such provisions were imposed by an
arbitrator in binding arbitration but the municipality is seeking to
eliminate such a contractual obligation through collective bargaining.
If answering “N/A”, the municipality must identify under
“comments” each such provision imposed by an arbitrator, along
with the status of the collective bargaining negotiations to eliminate
such a provision.

The Township argues that the elimination of longevity for new hires will

enable it to answer “yes” to question 29, thus improving its overall score on the
DCA questionnaire, which in turn will reduce the risk that its State funding will be
reduced or eliminated.

Further, the Township has already enacted an ordinance eliminating
longevity pay for new hires among unrepresented employees after January 1,
2017. According to Pogorzelski, the Township has made the same proposal with
regard to longevity benefits to all of its other collective negotiations units.
Moreover, the Township also emphasizes that on October 17, 2016 it completed
negotiations with CWA representing the Township’s white-collar employees. The
signed Memorandum of Agreement with CWA included the elimination of
longevity for new hires in that unit. The Township contends that these facts form
the basis of a pattern of settlement among all Township employees and that |am
bound by case law to follow the pattern of settlement.

The Township also notes that interest arbitrators are more and more
frequently eliminating longevity for new hires among municipal police units,
finding that such elimination is in the interest of the taxpayers.

The SOA notes that at this point, Hopewell’s employees in all represented
units continue to receive longevity benefits.

find that there is insufficient justification to award the elimination of
longevity for new hires. First, as to the DCA best practices questionnaire, | note

that even if | were to award that proposal, the Township still cannot respond
“yes” to question #29 untess it successfully negotiates the longevity elimination
for new hires in its three civilian units. Moreover, the DCA permits the Township
to answer “N/A” to the question if the provision was imposed by an interest
arbitrator.

Second, the Township is correct that a pattern of settlement among other
employees of the same jurisdiction is a strong justification for an arbitrator to
foitow the pattern. County of Union, P.E.R.C. No. 2003-87, 29 NJPER 250,253
(4175, 2003). An internal pattern of settlement properly focuses on the terms of
economic improvement offered in a given round of negotiations. See,

Somerset County Sheriff's Office v. FOP Lodge #39, Docket No. A-1899-06T3, 34

 

NJPER 8 (App. Div. 2008); Union County Sheriff, Docket No. |A-2012-037
(Osborn, 6/11/12]; County of Passaic, PERC No. 2010-42 and PERC No. 2011-

36. See aiso, County of Essex and PBA Local No. 157, Docket No. |A-87-45,

 

pages 17-8 (Scheinman, 1989). Here, however, there is no pattern of
settlement dictating the longevity elimination. Except for the unrepresented
Township employees, which had their longevity for new hires eliminated by
Township ordinance, all other Township employees still enjoy this benefit. In
fact, employees in the CWA unit, the AFSCME unit, and the Dispatchers

Association ail have longevity plans similar to the police, and all have three tiers
 

-- $1,000, $1,500 and $2,000. Even the recently signed Mod with CWA covering

certain civilian employees is still contingent upon ratification by the membership

and approval by the governing body.

Third, a closer look at the employees’ existing longevity plan reveals that

this plan is comparatively modest when compared to longevity benefits for other

municipal police officers in Mercer County.

As seen from this chart, Hopewell’s longevity plan is already lower than the

longevity pian of any municipality in Mercer County that has a longevity plan.

Further longevity is expressed in flat dollars (as opposed to a percentage of base

pay), and remains a constant value unless the parties negotiate increases to it.

In addition, where arbitrators have awarded the elimination of longevity

 
for new hires, it has been in combination with an examination of the employees’
salaries and other benefits, and has taken into account the employer's financial
position, Typically, where the parties negotiate fongevity out of the contract, itis
a product of a give and take -- where the Union may agree to give backs, such
concessions usually involve a trade-off for other terms and conditions of
employment. That is not the case here. Further, this is not a situation where
the employer finds itself in dire financial straits and in need of relief, In fact, the
entire longevity package for the SOA unit, where all employees are at maximum,
is only $8,000 annually or .0004% of the Township's budget. Any cost savings
and the impact on the taxpayer is de minimis. In considering the employees’
existing terms and conditions of employment, the comparable longevity benefit
in other Township contracts, the longevity enjoyed by other municipal
employees in Mercer County, and the impact on the taxpayers, i find that the
Township has not sufficiently justified its proposal to eliminate longevity for new
hires. This proposal is not awarded.
Article 9, Health Insurance:

Police currently enjoy a choice of plans between Horizon Direct 15 plan and
Horizon PPO 15 plan. Each of these plans has a $15 co-pay for office visits. in
this matter, the Township seeks to impose a base plan, Horizon Direct Access

20/30 plan. The Township does not seek to eliminate the existing plans but
proposes that officers would be permitted to “buy up” to either of the existing
plans by paying the premium difference between the base plan (20/30) and the
more expensive plan.

The primary reason the Township seeks to implement this change is that
the 2027 premium rates for the existing medical plans are projected to increase
by 25.6%. in addition, the Township argues that several questions on the DCA’s
Best Practices Inventory for 2016, relate to health benefit and prescription
insurance. The Township’s inability to answer these questions affirmatively will
reduce its overall score and put State aid at risk. Further, the Township
contends that it has already committed to changing to the 20/30 plan for its
unrepresented employees on January 1, 2017, and it has successfully negotiated
the plan change with CWA, representing the Township's white-collar workers.

The Union strenuously objects to the Township's proposed change in
health benefit plans. It notes that the proposed 20/30 plan has a co-pay of $20
for office visits and $30 for specialists -- a significant increase from the current
$15 for all office visits. The Union also argues that overall the 20/30 plan affords
the employees lesser benefits at a greater expense. It notes that deductibles are
higher, co-pays are higher, emergency room visits are more costly and maximum
out-of-pocket expenses are higher. The Union notes that its members have

already incurred significant increases to the cost of their health care by the
recent full implementation of Chapter 78. The Union proposes instead, that |
award the creation of a “Plan Design Committee” to review all of the options and
make recommendations to the governing body.

DCA Best Practices Inventory Questionnaire:

 

Borgos testified that the 2015 DCA survey included the following questions
concerning medical and leave time benefits:

36. Does your municipality conduct a monthly review of health
benefit covered lives itemized on health insurance invoices to
determine that health insurance invoices do not include
employees, former employees, spouses or dependents who
should no longer be receiving coverage?

37. Municipalities frequently contract with or designate
insurance brokers to secure healthcare coverage from insurance
carriers. Brokers are typically paid by third-party administrators
{TPA's) hired to collect, review and pay healthcare bills. The
municipality pays the TPA, who in turn pays the broker. Broker
fees are often directly related to the amount of insurance
premiums or fees paid by the municipality {i.e. the higher the
premium, the iarger the broker's commission}. Thus, the
municipality-broker-TPA arrangement is vulnerable to abuse
because brokers could face conflicting incentives in seeking
lower-cost insurance alternatives. If your municipality contracts
with or otherwise designates an insurance broker, is the structure
for broker payments set at a flat-fee rather than on a commission
basis (so as to mitigate the risk of brokers recommending more
expensive insurance coverage to earn higher fees}?

 

 

 

38. The State Health Benefits Program {SHBP} offers medical,
prescription and dental coverage options for more than
850,000 participants, including employees, dependents and
retirees. All plans have substantial networks of healthcare
providers, and provide services nationwide. 62% of
municipalities, and 33% of counties, within New Jersey
participate in SHBP. If your municipality has non-SHBP
coverage, as your collective bargaining agreements come up

for renegotiation, do your municipality's negotiation proposals
seek contract provisions allowing its employees to be switched
to SHBP or another_non-SHBP plan of lesser cost?

 

 

 

 

49. Does your municipality have a transitional duty program (light
duty} to encourage employees out on workers’ compensation to
return to work?

50. The State Workers Compensation Law provides that, when an
employee receives a work-related injury producing a temporary
disability, the employee is entitled to wage continuation equal to
70% of the employee's weekly wages, subject to a maximum
compensation as determined by the Commissioner of Labor. Does

our municipality limit benefits for work-related injuries to the
above statutory benefit? The answer to this question can be
“prospective” if such a provision was imposed by an arbitrator in
binding arbitration but the municipality is seeking to eliminate
such a contractual obligation

 

A sample of worksheet questions for CY2016 is provided below: (U-81A)

23. |s your municipality collecting at least the amount set forth by the
Chapter 78 Grid for health benefit contributions {ar 1.5% of base
salary, whichever is greater) for all officers and employees?

 

 

 

The Township is concerned with the DCA’s emphasis on controlling health
care costs, as evidenced by the number of questions invelving health care on the
survey. A municipality's inability to answer the questions affirmatively and to

receive a sufficiently high score could put State aid at risk.

Cost of Medical Coverage:
Borgos testified that the Township Committee has a desire to reduce
spending and reduce taxes. The Committee is looking at large cost drivers, such
as “employee benefits”, in the municipal budget. (17-131)

The Township currently has a contract for insurance brokerage services with
Robert Maguire of Integrity Consulting Group. The contract provides for a flat
brokerage fee of approximately $32,000", regardless of the cost of insurance
premiums or whether any savings are realized.

The Township received initial 2027 renewal rates for its current medical
plans, PPO 15 Copay, Direct Access 15 Copay. Harizon projected a 25.6%
increase in the cost of the present plans. As a result, Pogorzelski requested
Maguire to look into alternative plans that might produce some cost savings to
the Township. Maguire recommended that the Township consider the Horizon
20/30 plan and possibly New Jersey State Health Benefits Plan (SHBP) as
alternatives to the present plans. Comparisons of premium costs for medical

benefits are shown in Employer's exhibit E-120 as follows:

Maguire testified that there are no brokerage fees for the SHBP (1T-111).

Maguire explained that exccept for those lines labeled “Annual Premium” in

the chart above, all other figures represent a per employee monthly cost for the

coverage listed. Because the Township's civilian employees are in a PPO $10 co-

 
e

pay plan, those costs are listed separately in the chart. However, the “Total
Medical Annual Premium” line includes costs for all employees under the existing
plans, the 20/30 plan and the SHBP

As can be seen by the chart above, if the Township stayed with the existing
Direct 15 plan, Township-wide medical premium costs would increase by 25.6%
($561,961). If the Township migrates to the 20/30 plan as a base plan, costs will
increase by 13.9% ($305,791). However, if the Township were to elect the SHEP,
costs would only increase by 4.3% ($94,479).

In addition, Employer exhibit E-120 also provides the prescription drug

For 2017, the initial Horizon BCBSNJ Access 15 Copay Rx rates will increase
by $197,430 or 29.8% over the 2016 rates; whereas, the Horizon BCBSNJ Direct
Access 20/30 negotiated rates equate to an increase of $53,817 or 8.1% over the
current BCBSNI Rx rates. Moreover, the SHBP initial Rx rates for 2017 would
reduce prescription premium costs by $84,908 ar 12.8% decrease over the
current plan. (E-120} In summary then, | am compelled to note the combined
cost changes for medical and prescription premiums if the Township migrated to
the SHBP would only be $9,571 -- a mere .003% increase. 2
Chapter 78 Contributions

The employees in this bargaining unit are currently in Tier 4 of the Chapter
78 mandated employee contribution rates. For members of this bargaining unit,

all have a current salary over $110,000 and therefore, all contribute at the top

For 2017, the New Jersey State Health Benefits Commission SHBP — Local Government
Group is recommending an overall SHBP medical/RX premium rate decrease of 0.1% for active

employees.
rate of 35% of premium costs. Comparing employee contributions for the present

pians with the proposed 20/30 plan, the employees’ contributions would be:

Here, it should be noted that these contribution rates are based upon the

current premiums, not those projected increased premiums for 2017. In

essence, by switching to the 20/30 plan, the employee contributions would be

reduced by either $570 or $1,451 depending upon which plan the employee is

the Employer.

Note: The numbers in parenthesis for the “Med/Rx Rates” are the numbers of employees in each category.

In comparing the actual benefits between the existing plans and the 20/30 plan,

the individual and family deductibles are doubled. The maximum “out-of-pocket

expenses” increase from the Direct 15 plan to the 20/30 plan. Co-payments for

primary care office visits increased from $15 to $20 and co-payments for

 
aa

specialist office visits increased fram $15 to $30. Co-payments for emergency
room visits quadrupled from $25 to $100. In addition, out-of-network payments
decreased in every category from 80% to 60% if the employees were previously in
the PPO 15 plan.

On the plus side, Maguire testified that the Horizon network for the existing
plans is identical to the network participating in the 20/30 plan. Therefore,
employees should have no difficulty keeping their existing practitioners. Also,
like the existing plans, no referrals are required in the 20/30 plan. Further, if the
patient remains within the network, the individual family deductibles go from
$200/$400 to $0 in the 20/30 plan.

Employees are currently paying $7.50 for generic prescriptions and $10 for
brand name with a $3 co-pay for all mail orders. Under the 20/30 plan,
prescription costs would increase for in-store prescriptions to $15 generic and
$25 brand name with a $3 co-pay by mail for generic and a $25 co-pay for brand
name.

Buying Up to Traditional Plan

Under the Township's proposal employees would be enrolled in the 20/30

plan or could use the “buy-up” option to obtain the PPO 15 plan or Direct Access

$15 plan. The employee's Chapter 78 contribution would be based upon the
as

Direct Access 20/30 plan; however, the employee would also pay the incremental
cost difference between the 20/30 plan and the PPO 15 plan premiums. (1T- 59)
The monthly cost to an employee enrolled in family coverage to buy-up to the
existing plan they have today would be $324.15 ($2,703.65 - $2,379.50), or
$3,889.80 annually. This is in addition to the employees’ Chapter 78 contribution.

As can be seen by the chart above, six of the ten municipalities in Mercer County
use State Health Benefits Plan to provide medical coverage for tis employees.
This is comparable to the state-wide average: DCA reports that 62% of New

Jersey's municipalities are enrolted in State Health Benefit Plan.
While the Town argues that it has already negotiated with CWA to change
to the 20/30 plan, as previously noted, this MoA has not yet been ratified by
either party. Therefore, only the unrepresented employees in the Township are
currently slated to go into the 20/30 plan in 2017.

lam not persuaded to award the Township’s proposal to create the
Horizon Direct Access 20/30 plan as the base plan for unit employees’ healthcare
and prescription coverage. First, | agree with the Township that, given the
steeply spiraling cost of maintaining the current plans, it is not in the public
interests to continue to maintain these plans for Township employees. If the
current plans are left in place, the overall health care costs for Township
employees will increase from $2,198,586 to $2,760,547 for a cost increase of
$561,961, placing an undue burden on the Employer’s budget, and ultimately the
taxpayer's. Conversely, maintaining the present plans is also not in the interest
of the police bargaining units. As premium costs increase, so too will employee
contributions increase; sergeants are already paying between $8,281.98 and
$11,084.68 in Chapter 78 contributions at the 35% level. Maintaining the
existing plan would cause the employee contribution for family coverage to rise
to $13,921.50 at the projected 2017 increased premium rates. Indeed, the
increase in healthcare contributions of $2,837 consume all of the employees’

2017 salary increases of $2,367 ($118,346 current salary x 2%). This will not
improve employee morale.

On the other hand, | am not persuaded that the proposed Horizon 20/30
plan is necessarily the option that would be in the best interest of the Township,
the employees or the public interest. The propased 20/30 plan appears to be
more costly to employees in several ways in that deductibles are higher, per visit
co-pays are higher, emergency room visits are 400% higher than the current plan
and maximum out-of-pocket expenses are higher. In addition, the modified
prescription component of the 20/30 plan, is more costly to employees, as co-
pays will rise from the current levels of $7.50/$10 to $10/$25 for in-store
prescriptions, while the cost for brand name prescriptions by mail will increase
from $3 to $25.

A comparison of the prescription premium cost between the present plan,
the 20/30 plan and the SHBP reveals that while the 20/30 plan has a lower
premium price tag than the existing programs, it is still more costly than the
SHBP. in comparing costs for all Township employees, the 20/30 plan would
have an aggregate cost to the taxpayers of $716,773 (a 8.1% increase over the
current premium costs}, while the SHBP would cost $578,048 -- a potential
savings of $138,725 over the prescription costs of the 20/30 plan. Moreover, if
the Township enrolled its employees in SHBP, it would no longer have to incur

the cost of the insurance brokerage fee which would result in a savings of
48

approximately $32,000. While no plan benefit specifications have been
provided for the SHBP, | note that the record indicates that 62% of New Jersey
municipalities are enrolled in SHBP, as are a majority of the municipalities in
Mercer County.

Moreover, the DCA Best Practices Questionnaire includes questions that
suggest DCA encourages participation in SHBP. Enrollment in SHBP would
perhaps permit the Township to secure a greater number of credits on the
questionnaire and reduce the likelihood that State aid would be cut. This is also
in the public interest.

Given the significant savings that might be obtained from the SHBP, | am at
a loss to understand why the Township would prefer the 20/30 plan and reject
‘the SHBP. | therefore award a modified version of the Union‘s proposal for the
formation of a Plan Design Committee, as follows

| direct that a Plan Design Study Committee, composed of labor and
management representatives, be formed to study health care plan alternatives,
including but not limited to the State Healthcare Plan and the Horizon 20/30 plan.
Each party shall bear the cost of any outside consultants retained by that party. if
the parties are unable to agree upon alternative plans within a period of sixty
days, then | will impose a plan from among those offered by the parties. | will

issue a ruling on health care plans, if necessary, within 45 days of that parties’
ag

notice of their failure to agree ona plan. Such agreed upon or awarded new
pian will be included in the parties’ 2016-2018 contract and will be implemented
as soon as practicable.

This award will provide the parties with an opportunity to do a more in-
depth analysis of alternative plans than this arbitration would permit. It is in the
interest of both parties to seek out the best alternatives.?* It is also in the
public’s interest that the Township find alternative plans that will control costs —
a benefit to the taxpayers — and yet will allow its workforce to maintain good

health.

The Township also seeks to modify the language of Article 9, Section
A, as follows

The Township reserves the right to [may] change health insurance
benefit carriers at its discretion provided such change [of coverage]
will provide substantially the same level of benefits for bargaining
unit employees [be equal to or better than the coverage previously
enjoyed]

 

 

The Township has not provided sufficient justification that this language

modification should be awarded. This proposal is denied.

See, Byram Township, P.E.R.C. No. 2013-72, 39 NJPER 477 (41151 2013).

It is not clear from the record whether migrating to a new plan and/or carrier would require
the cooperation of the civilian employees’ representatives.
80

Coverage Waivers:

The Township proposes to eliminate Article 9, section G from the contract.
This section provides for payments to employees for the waiver of Township-
provided medical benefits. Article 9, G., provides as follows:

Unless otherwise set forth by applicable law, any employee who is
eligible for health care coverage and elects to waive the coverage by
the Township, shall receive an annual amount (to be paid on per pay
basis) which shall not exceed 25% or $5,000, whichever is less, of the
amount saved by the Township (N.J.5.A. 40A:10-17.1). An employee
who waives coverage shall be permitted to resume coverage under
the terms and conditions as applied to initial coverage if the
employee ceases to be covered through the employee's souse for
any reason, including, but not limited to, the retirement or death of
the spouse or divorce.

The Township contends that the above provision is non-negotiable because
it is preempted by statute. Therefore, the Township seeks to remove this
provision from the contract, The Township argues that while the waiver of health
benefits is in the public’s interest and welfare, the inclusion of a non-negotiable
term of employment in a collective negotiations agreement is not. The Union has
not conceded the Employer's claim that the matter is entirely preempted by

statute.

 

Health benefit waiver payments are controlled by NJ.S.A. 40A:10-17,1

which provides,

Notwithstanding the provisions of any other law to the contrary, a
county, municipality or any contracting unit as defined in section 2 of
P.L. 1971, ¢ 198 (C:40411.2) which enters into a contract providing
group health care benefits to its employees pursuant to N.J.S.A
40A:10-16 et seq., may allow any employee who is eligible for other
health care coverage to waive coverage under the county's,
municipatity’s or contracting unit’s plan to which the employee is
entitled by virtue of employment with the county, municipality or
contracting unit. The waiver shall be in the such formas the county,
municipality or contracting unit shall prescribe and shall be filed with
the county, municipality or contracting unit. In consideration of
filing such a waiver, a county, municipality or contracting unit may
pay to the employee annually an amount, to be established in the
sole discretion of the county, municipality, or contracting unit, which
shall not exceed 25% or $5,000, whichever is less, of the amount
saved by the county, municipality or contracting unit, because of the
employee's waiver of coverage. An employee who waives coverage
may be permitted to resume coverage under the same terms and
conditions as applied to initial coverage if the employee ceases to be
covered through the employee's spouse for any reason, including but
not limited to the retirement or death of the spouse or divorce. ..
The decision of a county, municipality or contracting unit to allow its
employee to waive coverage and the amount of consideration to be
paid therefor shall not be subject to the collective negotiations
process (emphasis added).

 

 

 

It appears that this statutory provision, and particularly the last sentence of the
ianguage, gives the employer sole discretion to decide whether to offer
employees a waiver of coverage in exchange for a waiver payment, and if so, to
determine the amount of the payment, subject to the statutory caps. It also
specifically prohibits the parties from negotiating over the decision to permit
waivers and the amount of the waiver payment. However, nothing in the statute
pre-empts negotiations over the form of payment. Here the parties’ existing
contract language provides the form and timing of the payment and states that
payment shall be included in regular pay checks.

In Cumberland County Prosecutor, Docket No. [A-2012-28 and IA-2012-29
(5/14/12), Arbitrator Mastriani recommended modified contract language to A

similar opt-out provision recognizing the Employer's statutory right to permit
heaith benefit waivers and to set the amount of the waiver payment. The
modified language also required the Employer to provide employees with thirty
days’ notice of any change to the program.’*

The Township also notes that it recently concluded negotiations with CWA
for a successor agreement covering certain of the Township's civilian employees.
That settlement, which is memorialized in a Memorandum of Agreement (MoA)
dated October 17, 2016, includes a provision for the elimination of the coverage
waiver language in the CWA agreement. However, as previously noted, that MoA
is subject to ratification by both the Union membership and the Township
governing body and therefore, the document does not constitute a final
agreement.

In considering the parties’ arguments, I find that part of the existing
provision is pre-empted by N.J.$.A. 40A:10-17.1 but is not entirely statutorily pre-
empted. Further, | find that the Township's argument as to a possible pattern of
settlement concerning the elimination of the health benefit waiver language is
not persuasive since the MoA with CWA is still contingent upon membership
ratification and governing body approval.

| award the following:

‘The Employer appeuled the arbitrator's award. However, in Cumberland County Prosecutor, P.E.R.C. No, 2012-
66, 39 NUPER 32 (4110 2012), the Commission found that the appeal was moot because the Employer decided not
to implement an opt-out program.
The parties recognize that the Township has the right, pursuant to
N.J.5.4. 40A:10-17.1, to determine, in its sole discretion, whether to
permit employees to waive health benefit coverage, and to
determine the amount of payment to made to such employees,
provided that the amount does not exceed 25% of the coverage
waived or $5,000, whichever is less. If the Employer offers waiver
compensation to SOA unit employees, such payments shall be made
to the employee on a per pay basis.

Article 18, “Uniform and Equipment Maintenance and Replacement

 

The SOA proposes a one hundred and fifty-dollar ($150) increase in
each calendar year on the clothing allowance. The Union argues that this increase
is necessary because the existing allowance does not adequately cover the
employees’ cost of updating their uniforms regularly. The Township contends
that the Union has not sustained its burden to justify any increase in the clothing
allowance.

receive an annual clothing allowance of $950.

Detectives
Patrolman John Ferner, PBA President, has been employed with the
Hopewell Township's Police Department for 20 years. Ferner testified that the
uniform of the day is set by the Department and that the purchase of said uniform
must meet the Department's requirements and specifications criteria. Ferner
purchases his uniforms and equipment at Samzie's Uniform Supply in Ewing. To
Ferner’s knowledge, most of the officers in the Department purchase their
uniforms from Samzie’s Uniforms. Ferner acknowledged that based on his
personal experience, Samzie’s prices were consistent and competitive with other
stores. (11-15-16)

Ferner testified that there are two required uniforms; one for summer and
one for winter; and day and night uniforms. Ferner explained that there is a
Class A uniform which is the day uniform and a Class B uniform which is the night
uniform. There is a winter and summer uniform for both the Class A and Class B
uniform. Ferner testified that the summer uniforms are worn by the officers
commencing April 1 of the calendar year through September 30 of the calendar
year. Winter uniforms are worn from October 1 through March 31 of the
calendar year. Ferner stated that the sergeants have a prerogative to switch
uniforms depending on the temperature of the day. Moreover, detectives are also

required to maintain a Class A and Class B uniform. (2T-17-19; 25)
Pogorzelski testified that his only concern with the clothing allowance
proposal is that the Township does not know if the allowance is being spent on
clothing. According to Pogorzelski, the Township’s contract with AFSCME
includes a tool allowance and unit members are required to provide receipts for
tools purchased to demonstrate that they are using the Township’s money for the
stated purpose (1T-155-156).'’ Ferner testified that U-3 reflects a basic issue for

the Department and is a 2016 estimated price list from Samzie’s Uniforms.

However, the Township has not proposed this modification to either the SOA and PBA
contract.
Ferner testified that the Township provides the initial uniform issued to
each officer (11-27). He stated that the Township initially provides seven shirts
for each officer, of which about five are used. Ferner stated that he did not have
any receipts with him for the number of shirts that were purchased as
replacements for the Department each year, but that he did know that he
personaily purchased two pairs of Class A pants last year at $110 or $220 total; in
addition, he purchased boots for $289 (27-30-31).

The SOA argues that the clothing allowance increase is necessary to enable
sergeants to purchase enough replacement clothing and gear throughout the year

to replace uniform components that are worn out. However, treating Ferner’s
purchases last year as a typical example of annual purchases for all PBA and SOA
members, it is evident that the purchases do nat exceed the present uniform
allowance provided by the contract. Even if an officer were to make replacement
purchases for 4 shirts and 4 trousers (double what Ferner purchases) and boots
every year, the allowance would still be sufficient to cover the cost of purchases.’®

Further, it is noted that the employees’ uniform allowance is not intended
to reimburse officers for cleaning and maintenance of uniforms, as the contract
provides for the Township to clean and repair uniforms. And, the Township also
replaces clothing damaged in the line of duty. Finally, the uniform allowance
provided to Hopewell’s officers is slightly above the average uniform allowance
for other municipal police in Mercer County.

In light of the above, | am not persuaded that an increase to the clothing
allowance is warranted at this time. Awarding such an increase would not be in

the public interest.

38.4 Trousers, 442 (4 x 110.58); 2 Long sleeved shirts, 111 (2 X 55.56); 2 short sleeved shirts, 95
(2 x 47.83); 1 pr. Danner boots, 289. Total $937

38 Comparisons with other municipal police contracts as far as uniform allowances go is not
particularly meaningful because the allowance may cover maintenance costs. Additionally, in
those municipalities where officers do not have a contractual clothing allowance, this may be
because the parties have agreed to roll such an allowance into base pay rather than paying it as
a separate allowance.
