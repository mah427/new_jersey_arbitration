| was appointed interest arbitrator by the New Jersey Public Employment
Relations Commission in accordance with P.L. 1995, c. 425, in an impasse that
initially involved the City of Orange Township [the “City’] and PBA Local 89 [the
“PBA" or “Union’]. The mediation and interest arbitration proceedings with PBA
Local 89 were then joined, based upon the mutual agreement of all parties, with
the impasses that were reached between the City and FMBA Local 10 and FMBA
Local 210, Fire Officers Association. None of these impasses were resolved
despite the participation of all parties in several individual and joint pre-interest

arbitration mediation sessions.

A complexity arose early in the process when the City submitted, and the
Civil Service Commission approved, a layoff plan that included 52 layoffs and 24
demotions that were to take effect on January 7, 2011. The layoff plan was
challenged by the Unions. Agreements were reached by the employee
organizations to avoid layoffs or recall employees. The Fiscal Year 2011 budget
was presented with a $3.2 million reduction from Fiscal Year 2010 budget levels.
The reduction appears to have been linked to a $3 million cut in State Aid and
Urban Enterprise Zone cuts. This precipitated layoffs and demotions and
negotiations for cost saving accommodations and a search for grant funds to
avoid layoffs. By way of example, the FMBA and the City entered into an MOA

that included, among other things, several economic benefit modifications to
achieve an elimination of the proposed layoffs and the hiring of additional

firefighters through grant funds.

During the interest arbitration proceedings, the parties requested periods
of time to engage in direct negotiations without the participation of the arbitrator.
These efforts were unsuccessful and resulted in the reconvening of formal
interest arbitration hearings. An overall record was developed containing
evidence that, while individually submitted, included evidence that was relevant
to all of the impasses and known to alll parties. The record includes substantial
documentary evidence, well over two hundred exhibits, testimony, financial
reports and certifications. Post-hearing briefs were filed and transmitted to each
party on or about January 18, 2014. The record was then re-opened on October
29, 2014 through a submission by the PBA and the FOA, as supplemented on
November 14, 2014, regarding financial developments in the City and the
finances of the City's Water Sewer Utility as they may impact on the City's overall
finances. The FMBA concurred with the substance of these submissions. The
City responded on December 9, 2014. Supplemental submissions concerning
the City’s finances were filed by the PBA and the FOA on December 18, 2014
During the course of the proceedings, motions were filed by the FMBA to bar the
City from responding to its petition for interest arbitration on the grounds of
having filed an untimely response. The FMBA filed a similar motion on timeliness

challenging the City's December 9, 2014 response that contested the relevance
of the City’s Water Sewer Utility finances. | reserved on these motions and find
that the late filings were de minimus in nature and that no party in these
Proceedings was prejudiced in any way by the City's filings. It is noted that the
City's late filing of its response to the FMBA interest arbitration petition contained
concessionary demands that were later withdrawn by the City when the parties

agreed to submit revised final offers during the course of the proceeding.

As required by statute, each party submitted a last, or final offer, prior to
the conduct of the hearing. During the course of the proceedings, all parties, by
mutual consent, presented revised final offers. By way of example, the City's
initial final offers at hearing, but later revised, included a two and one-half (2 %)
year proposal with no wage increase for the first six months, a 3.5% decrease in
wages for the next twelve months followed by no wage increase for the next
twelve months. Its revised offers appear below. Revised final offers were also
made by PBA Local 89, FMBA Local 210 (FOA) and the FMBA Local 10. The

final offers stated below represent all of the revised final offers.

AA Degree $250
‘AA Degree in $500
Police Science

BA or BS Degree $7,000
BA or BS Degrees| $2,000

Health Insurance Opt-Out Payment

The PBA proposes that the payment for opting out of health
benefits coverage be increased from $2,500 to $5,000.

Article V and Article XII, Sick Leave Calculation.

 

The PBA is seeking to incorporate language into the parties’
CBA which would require the City to calculate sick time and
vacation time at a day for a day rate for all patrol PBA
members. Members’ daily sick time and vacation time
calculations, depending on the tour they work, should be
either 10.75 hours (patrol), 9.5 hours (detective) or 8.25
hours per day (other). The calculation of time should be
retroactive to January 1, 2010.

 

Article XVII, Life Insurance and Death Benefits, Section
2.
The PBA proposes that the life insurance benefit received by
a surviving spouse of an employee killed in the line of duty
be increased from $10,000 to $50,000.

Article XIV, Bereavement Leave, Section 1.

 

The PBA proposes to add the following to the definition of
immediate family member: grandchildren, sister-in-law,
brother-in-law and individuals residing in the employee's
household. Additionally, child should be defined as natural,
adopted or foster child

The PBA is seeking to revise the language in this section so
that bereavement leave does not commence until the first
day of the employee's tour following the date of death
Currently, bereavement leave commences the day following
the date of death.

Article XI, Court Time

The following sections of this article pertain to compensation
for active employees who are required to attend any judicial
or quasijudicial proceedings in connection with the
performance of his/her duties.

Section 1: If an employee is required to
appear in any court or in any judicial or
quasi-judicial proceeding in connection
with the performance of his duties on his
day off, time-off, or vacation day, he shall
be paid at the rate of one and one-half
(1%) times his base rate of pay for all time
spent, including travel time from and to
Orange Police Headquarters as per
existing department regulations, in
connection with any such appearance.

Section 3: If an employee is required to
utilize a private vehicle to meet the
requirements of Sections 1 and 2 of this
Article, he shall receive mileage
compensation at the prevailing ILR.S. rate
In addition, the City agrees to pay the
necessary parking expenses _—_for
appearances required by Sections 1 and 2
of this Article, whether incurred for a City-
owned or privately-owned vehicle. In
consideration for this benefit, any officer
who incurs a motor vehicle summons shall
be personally responsible for payment.

Section 4: It is understood and agreed
that the provisions of Article X, Section 2,
relating to 2 hours minimum call-in pay
shall apply to this Article XI; provided,
however, that the City shall provide a
minimum of three (3) hours call-in pay to
officers who are required to appear in any
court in the City of Newark in connection
with the performance of their duties on
their day off, time off, or vacation day.

The PBA proposes that the above provisions pertaining to
court time should apply to any member of the PBA who was
recently subjected to the City's layoff action and anyone who
may be impacted in the future. Many of the PBA employees
who were subjected to the layoff action were required to
attend judicial or quasi-judicial proceedings in connection
with job duties they performed prior to being laid off.
Language should be included in the CBA which entitles
these individuals to pay in the manner set forth above.

Seniority

The PBA proposes that language be included in the parties’
CBA which would acknowledge the seniority practice.
Specifically, language should be included in the CBA which
states that seniority will be abided by when making
assignments pertaining to overtime, side jobs and tour picks,
which are done twice a year.

Article IV, Manpower, Section A (Acting Officers).

 

Currently, Fire Officers who act in the capacity of a higher
rank are not compensated for acting officer duties unless

Article X, Salaries, Section K

Fire Superior Officers are currently required to obtain a fire
inspector license at their own expense and on their own
time. The FOA is seeking to revise this provision so that
employees are reimbursed for all courses associated with
obtaining their fire inspector license. The FOA is seeking to
revise this provision so that employees receive two personal
days per year for obtaining and maintaining their fire
inspector license.

Article XII, Clothing Allowance

The FOA is seeking to incorporate language into this
provision which would require the City to provide newly
promoted Fire Officers with a complete dress uniform at the
City's expense.

Health Insurance

The parties have agreed in past agreements in accordance
with an Award that health insurance benefits shall be paid for
any employee who has received a disability pension whether
on the job or off the job (accidental or otherwise). This
should be incorporated into the agreement.

Article Xill, Insurance, Section C

The contractual life insurance benefit received by a surviving
Fire Officer's family of an employee killed as a result of an
on-the-job injury should be increased from $10,000 to
$50,000. The reasons for this are obvious. Such an amount
is obviously and hopefully only rarely or never needed but is
clearly appropriate in the rare event of a line-of-duty death
and is present elsewhere.

Article Xill, Insurance, Section G
13.

15.

The “death benefit" which is provided to all members of the
bargaining unit should be increased from $4,000 to $10,000.

Article XV, Leave of Absence, Section B, Subsection 1

 

Members of the FOA who use bereavement leave for the
death of an immediate family member are required to report
back to duty the day after the funeral if they are scheduled to
work. This should be revised in a manner consistent with
the PBA and Police SOA. The SOA receive time off with pay
of up to four (4) consecutive work days in the event of a
death in the employee's immediate family

Article XV, Leave of Absence, Section B, Subsection 2

 

Currently, immediate family member is defined to include the
following: father, mother, father-in-law, mother-in-law,
grandparents of the employee or spouse, sister, brother,
sister-in-law, brother-in-law, child and foster child of an
employee, and his relatives residing in his household. The
following should be added to the definition of immediate
family member: adopted child, grandchildren, and individuals
residing in the employee's household. Members of the SOA
receive the above benefit.

Article XV, Leave of Absence, Section B, Subsection 2

 

The language should be clarified to show that a day is the
existing working day for Local 210's members, namely 24
hours. All reference to time off should confirm that a day off
is a 24-hour shift

Article XI, Holidays

Fire Officers receive ninety-five hours of holiday pay in base
pay. Members of the FMBA receive 110 hours of holiday
pay. The FOA is seeking to increase holiday pay to 110
since the FMBA receives 110 hours of holiday pay

BACKGROUND

The City of Orange Township is a municipality in Essex County with a
population of approximately 32,000. Its estimated median household income in
2013 was $42,654 compared to $54,176 in Essex County and $70,165 for the
State of New Jersey. Salaries for its public safety officers are comparatively low
within the County. In 2009, the median salary for its police officers ranked next
to last out of twenty-two (22) municipalities in Essex County. The City has
struggled to maintain staffing levels in its Fire Department. Projected layoff of
firefighters was avoided in 2011 through financial concessions from the fire
unions including a five (5) day salary deferral, a give back of fifty-five (55) hours
of holiday pay and compensatory time adjustments. Twelve (12) firefighters were

hired through a FEMA grant.

FMBA Local 10 represents fifty (50) rank and file firefighters. The last
collective negotiations agreement between the City and Local 10 expired on
December 31, 2009. FMBA Local 210, Fite Officers Association (FOA)
represents thirty (30) Fire Officers. The last collective negotiations agreement
between the City and the FOA expired on December 31, 2008. PBA Local 89
represents fifty-eight (58) rank and file police officers. The last collective
negotiations agreement between the City and the PBA expired on December 31,
2009. These prior agreements were reached by MOAs that modified prior fully

executed agreements. However, the parties did not execute new overall
collective negotiations agreements after reaching the MOAs. The record reflects
that the last fully executed collective negotiations agreements had expiration
dates of December 31, 2001 for PBA Local 89, December 31, 2004 for the FOA
and December 31, 2005 for the FMBA. During these time periods, the City and

the Unions also reached sidebar agreements on many issues.

The police and fire departments operate in a challenging environment.
While the crime rate in 2013 decreased from 2010 levels, property and violent
crime comparisons show the City at substantially higher levels than the State and
National averages. In 2009, the Fire Department responded to 246 fires, 169

medical service calls, 198 HAZMAT calls and overall responded to 1,882 calls.

Negotiations among the above parties commenced in early 2010. Due to
impasse, petitions for interest arbitration were filed. The last petition was filed on
December 14, 2010. Based upon the date of filings, the arbitrations were
conducted under the provisions of P.L. 1995, c. 425 prior to the enactment of the
2% “hard cap.” The parties engaged in many mediation and arbitration sessions,
some of which combined the submission of evidence along with voluntary
settlement efforts. These started on October 18, 2010 and continued on
February 17, 2011, July 5 and 10, 2012, January 14 and May 21, 2013.1 The
7 In the interim, the parties attempted on their own, but did not succeed, in reaching settlement although a
draft Memorandum of Agreement was constructed. The record contains reference fo this document. Iwill

Neither admit nor reference this document inasmuch as it reflects settlement discussions that are not
‘admissible according to applicable law.
final formal interest arbitration hearing was held on July 28, 2013. Post-hearing
briefs were filed in late January 2014. Additional submissions by all parties and
additional argument concerning recent financial developments in the City and the
finances of the City’s Water and Sewer Utility were filed through December 18,

2014.

Although there are many issues in dispute in all of the three units, the core
of the impasses concemed financial and compensation issues. Because the
City's financial condition was an issue that applied to all three bargaining units,
this decision’s references to the City's finances will be applicable to all three
units. This was consistent with a procedural agreement to have the City’s
financial presentations made in front of all three employee organizations with

opportunities for each Union to cross-examine City witnesses.

The parties are in sharp disagreement as to the extent to which the City
can fund any of the proposals of the Unions? The City relies mainly on
testimony explaining official budget documents it submitted into evidence as well
as testimony in the form of Certifications from Carl Smith, Tax Collector and Joy
Lascari, Chief Financial Officer. During the pendency of these proceedings, the

City transitioned from a fiscal year budget ending on June 30 of each year to a

2 For the purpose of depicting the positions of the partes, | will refer to the three employee organizations
individually by name and, where appropriate, collectively as “the Unions.”
calendar year budget ending on December 31 of each year. This occurred

during 2011 and created difficulty in the City’s ability to file a timely budget.

City testimony indicates that its fiscal problems were exacerbated in 2010
by a combination of many factors, including the impact of the deep recession on
its budget beginning in 2009. The State sharply reduced funding to the City
through the Urban Enterprise Zone program, the City added $473,350 in deferred
charges, had a deficit of $159,064 in receipts from delinquent taxes, a deficit of
$107,177 in miscellaneous revenues, a tax collection rate of 93.85% that forced it
to appropriate $3.3 million for its reserve for uncollected taxes and suffered
increases in debt reserve payments, health benefits and premium costs. Prior to
these unfavorable developments, the City had recently concluded a four year
agreement with its Police SOA for years 2008-2011 and was under contract in
2009 with PBA Local 89 and FMBA Local 10 for the last year of a four year
agreement that began in 2006. The FOA was not under contract in 2009 and this

year remains an open year.

Chief Financial Officer Lascari states that she is aware of all annual
budgets and annual financial statements since 2009 including the City's budget
that it proposed for calendar year 2013. She notes accurately that there are
three public safety units in this proceeding with the potential for multiple years’
worth of potential retroactive payments. She believes that the City would not be

able to absorb the cost of any retroactive payments. She describes the City as
being “plagued with the usual lack of commercial and industrial properties for real
property tax basis as well as the problem of a depressed tax-paying populace.”
She points to a discovery by a new administration that the City has been
underfunding its payments to its unemployment insurance carrier since 2010 and
as of July 1, 2013, owed $1,034,314.03. She further stated that the City has
been burdened by a 15% increase in health insurance costs, an outstanding
obligation on an ambulance service contract of $225,000, financial pressures
exerted by the “artificial” levy cap set by the State, an unfunded 27" pay period in

2010 which had not been properly budgeted, and decreasing state aid.

Tax Collector Smith emphasized that the City has been adversely affected
by property tax appeals since 2009 as a result of declining property values linked
to economic recession. He submits that in State fiscal year 2011, Orange lost a
total of $556,957.43 in real property tax dollars from judgments rendered in New
Jersey Tax Court and Essex County Board of Taxation. Tuming to the transition
year 2011, he states that Orange lost a total of $680,502.98 in real property tax
dollars from judgments rendered in New Jersey Tax Court and Essex County
Board of Taxation. He next referred to calendar year 2012, and that during the
budget year, Orange lost a total of $1,079,635. 12 in real property tax dollars from
judgments rendered in New Jersey Tax Court and Essex County Board of
Taxation. Noting that the total loss of real property dollars from July 1, 2010 to

December 31, 2012 was $2,317,095.53, he believes that going forward he

20
expects a similar loss of revenues based upon pending appeals. He stated that
the amounts owed have either been paid in real dollars to property owners or
provided by placing a credit on outstanding tax bills. The City represented
through public notices that despite the national recession, it has attracted new
development and revitalization of properties to help revenue production and to

control property taxes.

The Unions’ financial presentation was as set forth in the testimony of its
Financial Expert Raphael J. Caprio, PhD. who also authored a report containing
a comprehensive financial analysis of the finances of the City of Orange. For the
purpose of his report, Dr. Caprio testified that he reviewed and examined the
proposals for a new contract for PBA Local 89 and for Fire Officers Association
Local 210 covering the periods from January 1, 2010 to December 31, 2016 and
January 1, 2009 to December 31, 2016, respectively; and also the proposals for
FMBA Local 10 (rank and file) covering the period January 1, 2010 to December
31, 2015. He testified that he assessed the City's financial condition after relying
on an extensive set of materials, including but not limited to (a) the Essex County
Abstract of Ratables, 2006-2012, (b) Annual Financial Statements for the City of
Orange for SFY 2008 through SFY 2011, TFY2011 and their first calendar year
budget, i.e. FY 2012, (0) City Budgets for SFY2008-CFY2013, (d) City audits, (e)
recently adopted legislation, commonly referred to as Chapter 78 (the Pension

and Health Care Benefits Reform Law of 2011), (f) the distribution of salaries

21
within the PBA and FMBA Locals, aging costs, health care premium costs, and
other related wage and compensation data as provided by the City (g) State of
New Jersey data on the distribution of land use and numbers of parcels across
which and costs would have to be distributed (to complete a true impact
assessment), and finally (h) other budget and comparative data as necessary to
develop a complete analysis of the City’s ability to fund wage requests as
submitted by the Locals. After such review, Dr. Caprio opined that “it is my
unqualified conclusion that the City of Orange has, within all criterial as required
in current arbitrations and in particular considering the financial criteria and
impact upon the community, ample resources to fund the salary increases as

requested for settlement without detrimental impact on the community.”

Before turning to the evidence that the Unions have submitted the support
of Dr. Caprio's conclusion, it must be noted that his review of budget documents
led to a general confirmation of CFO Lascari's statement that the City would have
difficulty absorbing the cost of retroactive salary payments to employees in the
three public safety units at issue for 2010, 2011 and 2012. Dr. Caprio noted, and
criticized the fact that the City did not encumber funds to anticipate settling the
collective negotiations agreements or funding the terms of an interest arbitration
award. He contends that the City was not prudent when it did not encumber
‘such funds and further noted that the City was able to provide salary adjustments

during the 2010-2013 time period with other employee organizations. Reference

22
is made to an MOA between the City and the Police SOA on November 7, 2008
that called for 4% increases on January 1 of contract years 2008, 2009, 2010
and 2011. Later, on January 7, 2009, the MOA was modified to four years of 3%
increases in 2%/2% splits. He testified that if the City's position, in whole or in
part, were to be sustained on the issue of retroactivity, the City nevertheless has
the ability to improve salary scales in contract years prior to and beyond 2013 to
a level that would have incorporated salary increases that the Unions have
justified for the years that the City contends cannot be funded by retroactive
payments. In short, this could be accomplished by adopting the Unions’
proposals to defer retroactive monies for prior years towards the end of the

Agreement split into equal percentage amounts.

Dr. Caprio points to several areas of the financial evidence to support his
conclusion that the City can fund the Unions’ proposals. He observed that when
the State converted from a State fiscal year to a calendar fiscal year, the
completion of a six month transitioning fiscal year allowed for the retention of

resources and the reconstitution of the City's fund balance. He noted that:

[Mlany benefit payments typically are paid in the first three months
of the calendar year, and second, state aid is typically received in
the third quarter of the calendar year. Thus, while projecting a pro-
rated six-month appropriation budget, the City was (a) relieved of
making a significant benefits payment, while (b) receiving a full year
of state aid for only a six-month period (which in the case of Orange
is significant). The net effect of these two factors generally results
in a significant reconstitution to the municipal fund balance. In the
immediate case, the late distribution of property tax bills and

23
Politically motivated decision not to generate the full half-year
property tax levy provided some unnecessary challenges from
which the City has not addressed and is recovered from
Additional observations as to the City’s finances made in Dr. Caprio's
analysis can be summarized as follows.
* During the transition year budget and the 2012 fiscal year the City did not
use approximately $1 million in taxing capacity.

* The City has consistently appropriated substantially less funds than are
allowable under its appropriation cap.

* The City has raised less revenues in property taxes than are allowable
under the tax levy cap.

* Property tax projections in 2013 substantially exceed actual property tax
revenues in 2010

«The City’s collections and delinquent taxes have been increasing.

+ Locally generated miscellaneous revenues have shown improvement

* State aid has been consistent, stable and predictable.

* By 2013, the City was expected to reconstitute more than $1.1 million
through excess operations resulting in a significantly improved fund

balance at the end of 2013.

¢ The amount of the surplus that remains available in 2013 is at the highest
level since before 2009.

* Chapter 78 has resulted in a shift of up to 35% of premium costs from
taxpayers to employees, resulting in savings to the City and reductions in
take home pay for employees.

* The Chapter 78 impact has caused a loss of up to 9% of an employee's
compensation by 2015
The financial data on costs that | have resolved are based upon Dr.
Caprio's analysis of each of the Unions’ salary proposals. The exhibits include
costs of step movements and across the board increases, retroactive payments
and reductions in salary line items due to reductions in staffing. The Unions’

exhibits are the sole evidence on costs.?

The 2014 submissions (October 29, November 12 and December 18)
submitted by PBA Local 89 and the FOA, as concurred in by the FMBA, are
interpreted by the Unions to reflect that the Water and Sewer Utility substantially
improved its cash position and fund balance as of December 31, 2013, thereby
improving the City’s overall finances and that the City's redevelopment efforts
reflect an enlarging tax base that yields greater tax revenues. The Unions point
to a City document “Total Revenue from Development Projects 2012-2014:
$940,127.04" to show new revenues reaped by the City as well as a note in the
document showing that the funds are used to subsidize the City's tax base for the
purpose of law enforcement, firefighters and other critical services. The City
rejects the Unions submissions and submits that the revenues from the Utility in
2012 and 2013 did not cover expenses during those years and that it has
commissioned a study to look at the solvency of its utility operations. The City
also objects to the use of funds from its utility operations to fund payroll costs in

its public safety departments.

5 The costs of the salary portion of the Award are approximately one-half of the amounts set forth in Dr.
Caprio's cost analysis.

25
Although the City’s finances are mainly at issue, substantial evidence was
received concerning cost of living data and external comparables as they appear
in charts, graphs, labor agreements, PERC settlement data and interest

arbitration awards.

DISCUSSION

The statute requires the arbitrator to make a reasonable determination of

the above issues giving due weight to those factors set forth in N.J.S.A. 34:13A-

 

16g(1) through (9) that | find relevant to the resolution of these negotiations.

These factors, commonly called the statutory criteria, are as follows:

(1) The interests and welfare of the public. Among the items the
arbitrator or panel of arbitrators shall assess when
considering this factor are the limitations imposed upon the
employer by (P.L. 1976, c. 68 (C. 40A:4-45.1 et sea.).

(2) Comparison of the wages, salaries, hours, and conditions of
employment of the employees involved in the arbitration
proceedings with the wages, hours, and conditions of
employment of other employees performing the same or
similar services and with other employees generally

(a) In private employment in general; provided,
however, each party shall have the right to
submit additional evidence for the arbitrator's
consideration.

(b) In public employment in general; provided,
however, each party shall have the right to
submit additional evidence for the arbitrator's
consideration

26
(3)

(4)

(6)

(6)

(7)

(c) In public employment in the same or similar
comparable jurisdictions, as determined in
accordance with section 5 of P.L. 1995. c. 425
(C.34:13A-16.2) provided, however, each party
shall have the right to submit additional
evidence concerning the comparability of
jurisdictions for the arbitrator's consideration.

The overall compensation presently received by the
employees, inclusive of direct wages, salary, vacations,
holidays, excused leaves, insurance and pensions, medical
and hospitalization benefits, and all other economic benefits
received.

Stipulations of the parties.

The lawful authority of the employer. Among the items the
arbitrator or panel of arbitrators shall assess when
considering this factor are the limitations imposed upon the
employer by the P.L. 1976 c. 68 (C.40A:4-45 et seq.)

The financial impact on the governing unit, its residents and
taxpayers. When considering this factor in a dispute in
which the public employer is a county or a municipality, the
arbitrator or panel of arbitrators shall take into account to the
extent that evidence is introduced, how the award will affect
the municipal or county purposes element, as the case may
be, of the local property tax; a comparison of the percentage
of the municipal purposes element, or in the case of a
county, the county purposes element, required to fund the
employees’ contract in the preceding local budget year with
that required under the award for the current local budget
year; the impact of the award for each income sector of the
property taxpayers on the local unit; the impact of the award
on the ability of the governing body to (a) maintain existing
local programs and services, (b) expand existing local
programs and services for which public moneys have been
designated by the governing body in a proposed local
budget, or (c) initiate any new programs and services for
which public moneys have been designated by the
governing body in its proposed local budget.

The cost of living.

27
(8) The continuity and stability of employment including seniority
rights and such other factors not confined to the foregoing
which are ordinarily or traditionally considered in the
determination of wages, hours and conditions of employment
through collective negotiations and collective bargaining
between the parties in the public service and in private
employment

(9) Statutory restrictions imposed on the employer. Among the
items the arbitrator or panel of arbitrators shall assess when
considering this factor are the limitations imposed upon the
employer by section 10 of P.L. 2007, c 62 (C.40A:4-45.45).4

My review of the criteria will be based on the evidence presented as well

as applying well established standards that are ordinarily or traditionally
considered in determining terms and conditions of employment. The party that
seeks to modify existing terms and conditions of employment must meet a
burden to prove the basis for its proposed change. This burden cannot be met
by desiring enhanced terms and conditions of employment without providing
sufficient evidentiary support. No proposed issue can be deemed presumptively
valid in the absence of credible evidence justifying change. | also note that the
merits of awarding a proposal cannot be viewed in isolation. A decision to award
or deny any individual issue must include consideration as to its reasonableness

in relation to the terms of the entire award. In other words, there may be merit to

awarding or denying a single issue if it stood alone, but a different conclusion

 

During the pendency of these proceedings, the "annual tax levy cap” was modified from 4% to 2%.
may be reached after assessing its merits within the context of the terms of the
overall award. By way of example, comparability evidence may suggest the
awarding or improving of an economic benefit, but the financial impact of all
terms awarded may preclude the awarding of an individual proposal. | will first
review and decide issues that are common to all of the three bargaining units
other than salary. This will be followed by a review and decision on the issues
raised by each unit separately on a unit by unit basis. After review and decision
on salary for all three bargaining units, an award section will be provided that will

include an individual award for each individual bargaining unit.

Duration (PBA — FMBA — FOA)

PBA Local 89 proposes a seven (7) year agreement effective from
January 1, 2010 through December 31, 2016. FMBA Local 10 proposes a six (6)
year agreement effective from January 1, 2010 through December 31, 2016.
FMBA Local 210 (FOA) proposes an eight (8) year agreement effective from
January 1, 2009 through December 31, 2016. The City proposes a six (6) year
agreement effective from January 1, 2010 through December 31, 2015 for PBA
Local 89 and FMBA Local 10, and a seven (7) year agreement for FMBA Local

210 (FOA) from January 1, 2009 through December 31, 2015.

As is reflected above, PBA Local 89 and FMBA Local 10 each have

contracts that will commence on January 1, 2010 while the contract for FMBA

29
Local 210 (FOA) will commence on January 1, 2009. The start dates for new
agreements for each of these bargaining units shall be the day after the
expiration date for each of the prior contracts. | conclude that the interests and
welfare of the public will be best served by awarding an expiration date that is
common for all three units. In this instance, | conclude that this date should be
December 31, 2016. A common expiration date will allow the parties to confront
the City’s fiscal situation and other relevant evidence for each contract year at
the same time that negotiations are occurring rather than having to compare and
contrasting the results of bargaining years after one or more contracts have been
completed due to differing expiration dates. The December 31, 2016 expiration
date will allow for sufficient time for negotiations for a new agreement while
employees remain under contract prior to the expiration date. Accordingly, the
terms of duration shall be January 1, 2010 through December 31, 2016 for PBA
Local 89 and FMBA Local 10 and January 1, 2009 through December 31, 2016

for FMBA Local 210 (FOA).

Health Insurance — Disability (PBA — FMBA — FOA)

 

The Unions have proposed to incorporate the terms of a grievance
arbitration award that covered the issue of health insurance benefits for an
employee who has received a disability pension due to either an on-the-job or an
off-the-job disability injury. According to the Unions, the City is honoring the

award but nevertheless, it believes the issue should be incorporated into the

30
Agreement in order to reflect the terms of this specific condition of employment

for unit employees.

The grievance arbitration award involved the City of Orange Township and
Orange Police Benevolent Association Local No. 89; Superior Officers
Association; Orange Fire Officers Association Local No. 210; Orange Fireman's
Mutual Benevolent, Local 10 and Orange Municipal Employee Benevolent
Association. (AR-2005-715 and SB 04-0765, issued December 12, 2007,
Edmund G. Gerber, Arbitrator). The award is lengthy and need not be
summarized. In pertinent part, the award stated that “the City shall provide all
employees who retire on early disability with health insurance” because the
arbitrator found that the City violated the agreement by not providing health
benefits to members of the FMBA and FOA who retired on a disability after the

City had changed its health insurance plan.5

Based upon the above, | award the Unions’ proposal to include language
in the new agreements reflecting that the City will provide unit employees who

retire on early disability with health insurance pursuant to the Gerber Award.

® The arbitrator took note of the fact that the police units have express contractual provisions that provide for
this benefit

31
Health Insurance Contributions (PBA — FMBA — FOA)

 

In the course of their submissions concerning health insurance and
salaries, all parties acknowledged that legislation had been enacted requiring unit
members to contribute required amounts of base salary towards health care
benefits beginning May 21, 2010 pursuant to P.L. 2010, Chapter 2 and PLL.
2011, Chapter 78. Chapter 78 provides for amounts of health benefit
contributions pursuant to a percentage schedule based upon a combination of
the type of coverage the employee selects and the amount of base salary that
employee earns. There is no dispute as to the applicability of these provisions to
unit employees during this contract term. This award must be consistent with law
because NwJ.S.A. 34:13A-16g(5) and (9) require the arbitrator to consider the
City's lawful authority and statutory limitations. One such legal requirement on
the City was to implement Chapter 2 and Chapter 78 in accordance with their
terms. The health insurance articles in all three agreements should contain
reference to the legal basis for the contributions unit employees have been
required to make. Accordingly, the agreements shall include language reflecting
that health care contributions for unit employees shall be consistent with that

required by P.L. 2010, Chapter 2 and P.L. 2011, Chapter 78.

ie}
Health Insurance Opt-Out Payment (PBA — FMBA — FOA)

 

PBA Local 89 and FMBA Local 210 propose that the payment for opting
out of health benefits coverage be increased from $2,500 to $5,000. FMBA
Local 10 also proposes that a provision be included in its Agreement to provide a
stipend for those FMBA members who choose to opt out of coverage in the

amount of $5,000.

The City currently provides a payment when employees opt out from
receiving health benefits from the City. At hearing, it was estimated that the City
receives a savings in excess of $20,000 when an employee opts out of receiving
health benefits. The Unions have proposed that the payment for opting out of
health benefits coverage be increased from $2,500 to an amount that shall not
exceed 25%, or $5,000, whichever is less, of the amount saved by the Employer

because of the employee's waiver of coverage.

According to the Unions, the proposal is consistent with the clear
language set forth in N.J.S.A. 52:14-17.31a(c), as well as N.J.S.A. 40A:10-17.1
It is noted that Article XIII(H) in the existing FMBA Local 210 (FOA) Agreement
states that “individual employees may voluntarily waive the Employer provided
medical insurance and be paid for this waiver in the amount of $2,000 annually.”
The Unions’ proposal to increase the payment for opting out of health benefits is,

reasonable, consistent with statute, and supports the basic premise of
implementing a waiver; namely, that a public employer can achieve substantial
savings in health insurance premiums by providing a far lesser payment to an
employee who opts out of employer paid health care coverage and the employee
can receive a stipend as an incentive for doing so. Given this, and the absence
of challenge by the City, | award this proposal with the modification that its

implementation must be consistent in all respects with N.J.S.A. 52:14-17.31a(c)

 

and/or N 40A:10-17.1

Negative Sick Leave Recoupment (PBA)

 

The City proposes the imposition of a Negative Sick Leave recoupment
policy. According to the City, its proposal to the PBA would match the language

that is already in place for the Police SOA.

The City’s reference to the Police SOA is directed towards Section 6 of the
MOA it entered into with SOA Local 89 for the time period January 1, 2008
through December 31, 2011. The relevant term used in that section is
“unearned/negative sick leave.” Under prior practice, employees were allowed to
accrue and use uneamed sick leave balances. The agreement between the City
and the SOA contained a formula for recoupment of such time and a guarantee
from employees “that all unearned sick leave balances that have been accrued,
or which may accrue in the future, will be paid back to the City prior to, or upon

separation of employment.” Further, the MOA stated that “should an employee

34
become separated from the City through termination, retirement, etc.,

recoupment of all unearned sick leave will be immediately due to the City.”

In its post-hearing brief, the PBA refers to its October 7, 2013 submission
representing that due to an amicable resolution of this issue, this has obviated
the need to render an award on the issue. While note is made of this
representation, the record does not include an MOA on this issue that confirms
that the issue has been fully resolved. Accordingly, | award the City's proposal
but will retain jurisdiction over the issue in the event that the purported
agreement has been executed and/or implemented in a manner that requires that

the terms of this Award be clarified.

Article XXXIIl — Miscellaneous: Section 10, Education Pay (PBA)

 

PBA Local 89 currently receives educational stipends in the amount as

follows:
AA Degree $125
‘AA degree in police science $250
BA or BS degree $250
BA or BS degree in police science $500

The PBA proposes that the educational stipend be increased to the following

levels:

AA Degree $250
AA dearee in police science $500
BA or BS degree $1,000

BA or BS degree in police science $2,000

According to the PBA, the current stipend is only nominal and does not
provide an incentive for an employee to obtain an advanced degree. It submits
that the City and its residents benefit by police officers obtaining educational
degrees. It further submits that the current stipend is not comparable to that paid

in other communities.

| do not award the PBA’s proposal. Although it cannot be disputed that
there are benefits to be derived by an employee pursuing higher education, the
record reflects that the parties have reached prior agreement as to the level of
added compensation to be received for those who have already achieved a
degree. | do not find that a sufficient basis has been shown to award the change

proposed by the PBA.

 

k Leave Calculation (PBA)

PBA Local 89 proposes to incorporate language into the parties’
Agreement which would require the City to calculate sick time and vacation time
at a “day for a day” rate for all patrol PBA members. According to the PBA,
members’ daily sick time and vacation time calculations, depending on the tour

they work, should be either 10.75 hours (patrol), 9.5 hours (detective) or 8.25

cs
hours per day (other). The PBA also proposes that this new method for the

calculation of time should be retroactive to January 1, 2010.

According to the PBA, this proposal constitutes a “correction” and would
cure an injustice in how hours are calculated for sick time, vacation time,
personal days and seniority days. The argument in support of the proposal was
succinctly summarized in the PBA’s post-hearing submission:

In other words, these employees are now given hours for the

above-referenced contractual benefits based upon an eight-hour

work day multiplied by the number of days the employee is entitled

to without regard to the number of hours an employee works

When any employee takes a sick day, a vacation day, a personal

day or a seniority day, the charge against hours is not eight (8)

hours. Currently, employees are charged the actual hours worked

during a given day, which equates to 10.75 hours for patrol, 9.5 as

to Detectives and for those assigned to Administration.

I do not award this proposal. The PBA has not shown that the current
method of calculation is a mistake or a unilateral change in calculation that yields
an inequitable result. The existing scheme for the calculation of paid time off is
not, as argued, inconsistent with the method of calculation currently provided in
the agreement between the City and SOA Local 89 (Police Superiors). SOA
Local 89 converted to a 10.75 hour day effective June 1, 2008. When doing so,
the SOA and the City converted the then existing hours for sick days, vacation

days, seniority days and rank days into a formula that did not expand the amount

of paid leave time based upon the paid leave hours that were available to

37
employees prior to the conversion. A specific example of that conversion

appears in the MOA between the City and SOA Local 89:

All leave time shall be converted to hours, by way of example, the
current 15 eight-hour sick days, which are provided under the
current “4-2” schedule for a total of 120 hours because of the
current eight-hour day, shall be changed under the “4-4” work
schedule to 11.162, 10.75 hour sick days. This conversation shall
be applicable as well to vacation days, seniority days and rank
days.

Based upon the above, the proposal is denied.

Clothing and Maintenance Allowance — Detectives (PBA)

 

PBA Local 89 proposes to increase the Detective Clothing and
Maintenance Allowance from $250 to $1,000 and for the increase to be
retroactive to January 1, 2011. The PBA has established that the existing
allowance is nominal and below the level of this benefit generally received in law
enforcement. However, the level of increase sought cannot be justified based on
the overall financial impact of the terms of the overall award on the City
Accordingly, | award an increase of $250 in the Detective Clothing and

Maintenance Allowance effective January 1, 2015.

Life Insurance and Death Benefits (PBA)

 

PBA Local 89 proposes that the life insurance benefit received by a

surviving spouse of an employee killed in the line of duty be increased from
$10,000 to $50,000. It points out that a police officer's job is dangerous and that
the surviving spouse benefit is larger in other jurisdictions. This benefit presently
exists in Article XVII, Section 2. The existing benefit compares favorably to the
$10,000 death benefit currently received by the FMBA and FMBA Local 210

(FOA). Based upon this, the proposal is not awarded

Article XIV, Bereavement Leave, Section 1 (PBA)

 

The PBA proposes to add the following to the definition of an immediate
family member: grandchildren, sister-in-law, brother-in-law and_ individuals
residing in the employee's household. Additionally, the word “child” would be
defined as a “natural, adopted or foster child." The PBA contends that its
proposal would conform the scope of the definition of an immediate family

member to that set forth in the SOA agreement.

The PBA is also seeking to revise the language in this section so that
bereavement leave (not to exceed five (5) calendar days beginning with the date
of death) does not commence until the first day of the employee's tour following
the date of death as opposed to the current requirement that bereavement leave
commences the day following the date of death. The PBA asserts that the
proposed change provides sufficient time to grieve with the existing language

does not.

39
There is merit in the portion of the PBA proposal that the definition of an
immediate family member conform in scope to the definition of immediate family
member contained in the SOA agreement. | award this proposal. This will
provide for internal comparability and no evidence has been presented by the
City as to why the definition of an immediate family member should differ
between these two units. Accordingly, the definition of immediate family member
shall be expanded to include children (natural, adopted or foster), sister-in-law,

brother-in-law, grandchildren and individuals residing in his/her household.

| do not award that portion of the PBA proposal concerning when
bereavement leave should commence. The existing provision provides for
bereavement not to exceed five (5) calendar days beginning with the date of
death. The record does not establish sufficient evidence as to why the existing
provision is inequitable or arbitrary. | conclude that the status quo shall be

carried forward into the new agreement.

Court Time (PBA)

PBA Local 89 proposes changes to the existing provision on court time. It
is limited to laid off employees who are required to perform the same official
duties as if they were employees. The following sections of Article XI pertain to
compensation for active employees who are required to attend any judicial or

quasi-judicial proceedings in connection with the performance of his/her duties.

40
Section 1: If an employee is required to appear in any court
or in any judicial or quasi-judicial proceeding in connection
with the performance of his duties on his day off, time-off, or
vacation day, he shall be paid at the rate of one and one-half
(1%) times his base rate of pay for all time spent, including
travel time from and to Orange Police Headquarters as per
existing department regulations, in connection with any such
appearance.

Section 3: If an employee is required to utilize a private
vehicle to meet the requirements of Sections 1 and 2 of this
Article, he shall receive mileage compensation at the
prevailing ILR.S. rate.

In addition, the City agrees to pay the necessary parking
expenses for appearances required by Sections 1 and 2 of
this Article, whether incurred for a City-owned or privately-
owned vehicle. In consideration for this benefit, any officer
who incurs a motor vehicle summons shall be personally
responsible for payment.

Section 4: It is understood and agreed that the provisions of

Article X, Section 2, relating to 2 hours minimum call-in pay

shall apply to this Article XI; provided, however, that the City

shall provide a minimum of three (3) hours call-in pay to

officers who are required to appear in any court in the City of

Newark in connection with the performance of their duties on

their day off, time off, or vacation day

The PBA proposes that the above provisions should also apply to any
member of the PBA who was subjected to the City's layoff action and anyone
similarly situated who may be impacted in the future. The PBA submits that
many of the PBA employees who were subjected to the layoff action were

required to attend judicial or quasi-judicial proceedings in connection with job

duties they performed prior to being laid off.

41
| do not award the PBA's proposal in its entirety. Section 1 can only apply
to a current employee. | do award the PBA proposal to make Sections 2 and 3
applicable to a laid off employee because they are required to perform the same
duties as if they were employed. The award shall state:

Any unit employee who has been subjected to layoff and is required

to attend judicial or quasi-judicial proceedings in connection with

job duties they performed prior to being laid off shall be entitled to

the provisions set forth in Article XI, Sections 2 and 3 in the same
manner as if they had been employed at the time of the proceeding

 

Article XXIII, Wages, Section 2 (PBA)

PBA Local 89 proposes increase in annual payment from $750 to $2,000
for employees assigned to the Detective Bureau. It submits that it is one of the
lowest payments in the State and submits a chart supporting this contention
The PBA has established that the existing payment is nominal and below the
level of this benefit generally in law enforcement. However, the level of increase
sought cannot be justified based on the overall financial impact of the terms of
the overall award on the City. Accordingly, | award an increase of in the annual
payment for employees assigned to the Detective Bureau in the amount of $250

effective January 1, 2015.

42
Se (PBA)

 

PBA Local 89 proposes that language be included in the parties’
Agreement which would acknowledge the seniority practice. Specifically, it seeks
that language should be included in the Agreement stating that seniority will be
abided by when making assignments pertaining to overtime, side jobs and tour
picks, which are done twice a year. | do not award this proposal. The record
contains insufficient evidence that there has been a longstanding and consistent
practice that requires all assignments to overtime, side jobs and tour picks to be
made on the basis sought by the PBA. In the event that such practice can be
proven in a case where seniority has not been followed, the issue of the
enforceability of such practice can be presented in a grievance arbitration

proceeding.

Article XXXill — Miscellaneous: Section 10.
Increase in Education Pay (FMBA Local 210, FOA)

 

 

The FOA currently receives educational stipends in the amount as follows:

AA Degree $125
‘AA degree in fire science $250
BA or BS degree $250
BA or BS degree in fire science $500

The FOA proposes that the educational stipend be increased to the following

levels:

AA Degree $250
AA degree in fire science $500

BA or BS degree $1,000

BA or BS degree in fire science $2,000

According to the FOA, the current stipend is only nominal and does not
provide an incentive for an employee to obtain an advanced degree. It submits
that the City and its residents benefit by police officers obtaining educational

degrees. It further submits that the current stipend is not comparable to that paid

in other communities.

| do not award the FOA's proposal. Although it cannot be disputed that
there are benefits to be derived by an employee pursuing higher education, the
record reflects that the parties have reached prior agreement as to the level of
added compensation to be received for those who have already achieved a
degree. | do not find that a sufficient basis has been shown to award the change

proposed by the FOA.

Clothing and Maintenance Allowance (FMBA Local 210, FOA)

 

The FOA proposes to increase the clothing and maintenance allowance
from $350 to $600. It also proposes to incorporate language into this provision
which would require the City to provide newly promoted Fire Officers with a
complete dress uniform at the City's expense. The FOA has shown that the

existing allowance compares unfavorably to the comparisons it has presented

44
However, the increase to the allowance shall be for an additional $150, thus
raising the allowance to $500 effective January 1, 2016. | do not award the
proposal concerning dress uniforms. Article XII(A) provides that the City is now
obligated to provide an annual sum of $70 for the purchase of dress uniforms. It
states:
In addition to the annual uniform maintenance stipend, each
firefighter shall receive, the annual sum of $70 in lieu of the
provision of dress uniforms by the City. It is understood that by its
agreement to pay this additional $70 stipend in lieu of provision of
dress uniforms, the City is relieved from any obligation to provide,

or to have provided, dress uniforms for firefighters at any time.
Employees are not required to provide or have dress uniforms.

Given this language, | do not award the FOA’s proposal on dress uniforms.

Article Xill, Insurance, Section G (FMBA Local 210, FOA)

 

The FOA proposes that the “death benefit” be increased from $4,000 to
$10,000. The term “death benefit” in Section G is a life insurance benefit. It is a
separate benefit from a $10,000 benefit provided to a deceased fire officer's
family for death resulting from an on-the-job injury. The existing $4,000 amount
for the “death benefit” was negotiated with an effective date of January 1, 1986.
The PBA and SOA agreements currently provide a $10,000 life insurance
benefit. Given the date that the $4,000 amount was established in 1986 and the
fact that the PBA and SOA agreements currently provide a $10,000 life insurance

benefit, | find merit in the proposal and incorporate it into the award effective as
soon as is administratively feasible, but no later than ninety (90) days from the

date of this Award

Article Xill, Insurance, Section C (FMBA Local 210, FOA)

 

The FOA proposes to change Article XIII(C) by increasing the contractual
life insurance benefit received by a surviving Fire Officer's family of an employee
killed as a result of an on-the-job injury from $10,000 to $50,000. | denied a
similar proposal advanced by the PBA and noted that the benefit for the PBA,

FOA and FMBA is set at $10,000. Accordingly, the proposal is denied.

Article XV, Leave of Absence, Section B (FMBA Local 210, FOA)

 

The FOA has proposed to modify Article XV, Section B, Subsections 1

and 2. This provision currently reads as follows:

B. Funeral Leave

1. Special leave of absence with pay up to a maximum
of four (4) days shall be granted to any member of the
Department in case of a death within his immediate
family, but such member shalll report for duty the day
after the funeral if scheduled to work

2. The term “immediate family” shall include only father,
mother, father-in-law, mother-in-law, grandparents of
employee or spouse, sister, brother, sister-in-law,
brother-in-law, child and foster child of an employee,
and his relatives residing in his household.

46
The FOA proposes three specific changes to this Article. The first change
is intended to eliminate the requirement in Article XV, Section B(1) that the
member must report for duty the day after the funeral if the member is scheduled
to work. The FOA compares its existing provision with the bereavement leave
articles for the PBA and SOA where officers can receive time off without pay of
up to four consecutive work days. The specific proposal is as follows:

Members of the FOA who use bereavement leave for the death of

an immediate family member are required to report back to duty the

day after the funeral if they are scheduled to work. This should be

revised in a manner consistent with the PBA and Police SOA. The

SOA receive time off with pay of up to four (4) consecutive work

days in the event of a death in the employee's immediate family.

The second change sought by the FOA is to expand the definition of
“immediate family member’. Currently, an immediate family member is defined
in Article XV, Section B(2) as follows:

The term “immediate family’ shall include only father, mother,

father-in-law, mother-in-law, grandparents of employee or spouse,

sister, brother, sister-in-law, brother-in-law, child and foster child of
an employee, and his relatives residing in his household

 

 

Specifically, the FOA seeks to add to the definition of an ‘immediate family”
member, the following individuals: an “adopted child, grandchildren, and
individuals residing in the employee's household.” According to the FOA, this
proposal would extend the scope of the definition of an immediate family to that

as set forth in the SOA Agreement.

47
The third change to Article XV, Section B is to clarify subsection 2 to show
that a day is the existing working day for Local 210 members, namely, 24 hours.
Thus, all references to time off in the bereavement section would show that a
“day off” is a 24 hour shift. The FOA contends that the clarification it seeks is
nothing more than incorporating the parties’ longstanding practice into the

Agreement.

| award that portion of the FOA proposal to expand the definition of
“immediate family member” to include to add “an adopted child, grandchildren
and individuals residing in the employee's household.” This modification will
provide internal comparability with respect to the definition of an immediate family
member as provided in the SOA agreement and as awarded to the PBA
agreement. | also award the addition of “spouse” which apparently was
inadvertently omitted from both the prior agreement and the FOA proposal in
order to conform with the SOA agreement and the PBA article as awarded. | do
not award that portion of the FOA proposal with respect to the use of the
bereavement days and the requirement as to when a member must report to
duty. On this issue, because of the substantial differences in their respective
work schedules, | do not find the argument as to internal comparability with the

police department to be persuasive. | award the clarification sought by the FOA

48
that a reference to “days” in Article XV, Section B — Funeral Leave, be defined as

a 24 hour shift.

Article IV, Manpower, Section A (Acting Officers) (FMBA Local 210, FOA)

 

Currently, Fire Officers who act in the capacity of a higher rank are not
compensated for acting officer duties unless they work for five (5) hours of the
shift. The FOA is seeking to eliminate this restriction so that Fire Officers receive
compensation for any and all time worked in the capacity of a higher rank. | do
not award this proposal. It is not unreasonable for the City to require that a fire
officer perform acting officer duties for a reasonable period of time prior to

entitling that officer to compensation for working in the capacity in a higher rank.

Fire Inspector Pay (FMBA Local 210, FOA)

 

The FOA proposes to increase the Fire Inspector pay from $2,000 to
$3,000 and to incorporate this payment into base pay. The FOA cites to the 5%
stipend that a Fire Inspector Certification yields in South Orange. | do not find
that this sole comparison serves as sufficient justification for the increase in fire

inspector pay sought by the FOA. Accordingly, the proposal is denied.

49
Fire Inspector License (FMBA Local 210, FOA)

 

Fire Superior Officers are currently required to obtain a fire inspector
license at their own expense and on their own time. The FOA is seeking to
revise this provision so that employees are reimbursed for all courses associated
with obtaining their fire inspector license. The FOA is seeking to revise this
provision so that employees receive two personal days per year for obtaining and
maintaining their fire inspector license, | award a modification to Article X,
Section K only to the extent that a fire superior officer who obtains a fire inspector
license shall be reimbursed for courses associated with obtaining the fire
inspector license upon the completion and obtaining of the fire inspector license.
This shall be effective for those courses previously taken by fire officers who

complete and obtain a fire inspector license after the date of this Award

Holidays (FMBA Local 210, FOA)

The FOA is seeking to increase holiday pay to 110 hours. Its proposal is
based on matching the number of holiday pay hours currently received by the
FMBA. Article XI of the FOA Agreement currently provides for 95 hours of
holiday pay to be included in the base salary rate. This benefit was agreed to
effective January 1, 2001 when the City and the FOA incorporated holiday pay
into base salary for all years of service. An examination of the FMBA agreement

does reflect that the FMBA receives 110 hours of holiday pay. However, such

50
pay is based upon eleven (11) paid holidays at the rate of ten (10) hours per day
to be received as six (6) days in a pay period covering the first week of June and
five (5) days for the first pay period in December. An FMBA employee has an
option to have all of the holiday pay paid out in the first pay period of July. Unlike
the FOA, there is no provision in the FMBA agreement that these stipends are

included in the base salary rate.

Based upon the above, | do not award the FOA proposal. While its
proposal would match the number of hours received by the FMBA, the proposal
does not take into account that the FOA agreed to the number of hours received
as part of its agreement with the City to place holiday pay in the base salary rate.
This method of payment differs from that received by the FMBA, thereby
undermining the argument that comparability would be served by granting the

proposal.

Health Insurance (FMBA Local 210, FOA)

 

The FOA has proposed to incorporate the terms of a grievance arbitration
award that covered the issue of health insurance benefits for an employee who
has received a disability pension due to on-the-job or off-the-job disability injury.
According to the FOA, the City is honoring the award but nevertheless, the issue
should be incorporated into the Agreement in order to reflect this particular

condition of employment that employees are entitled to.

51
The grievance arbitration award involved the City of Orange Township and
Orange Police Benevolent Association Local No. 89; Superior Officers
Association; Orange Fire Officers Association Local No. 210; Orange Fireman's
Mutual Benevolent, Local 10 and Orange Municipal Employee Benevolent
Association. (AR-2005-715 and SB 04-0765, issued December 12, 2007,
Edmund G. Gerber, Arbitrator). The award is lengthy and need not be
summarized. In pertinent part, the award stated that “the City shall provide all
employees who retire on early disability with health insurance” because the
arbitrator found that the City violated the agreement by not providing health
benefits to members of the FMBA and FOA who retired on a disability after the

City had changed its health insurance plan.®

Based upon the above, | award the FOA proposal to provide unit
employees who retire on early disability with health insurance pursuant to the

Gerber Award.

Summer Uniforms (FMBA Local 10}

FMBA Local 10 proposes to incorporate what it terms ‘the previous
agreement” regarding the Fire Department purchasing summer uniforms. The

FMBA contends that the proposed provision would memorialize a prior practice

© The arbitrator took note of the fact that the police units have express contractual provisions that provide for
this benett

52
regarding the providing summer uniforms. In support of this proposal, the FMBA.
points to the testimony of its President, Ruben Padilla. According to Padilla,
there was a decade-long practice between the FMBA and former Fire Chief
DeMarzo wherein the Chief would accept a written report requesting a summer
uniform as a predicate for the department providing a uniform. According to
Padilla, the cost would be between $70 and $90 and the providing of the summer

uniform was not a regularly recurring cost.

1 do not award this proposal. The contract clearly reflects, at Article XII,
Section B, that summer uniform items are permitted but are not required. It
further states that such uniforms shall be permitted to be worn and purchased “at
their own cost and expense.” Given this clear language, the evidence alleging

prior practice does not support the awarding of the FMBA’s proposal.

Transfers Between Tours and Impact on Vacation Schedule

(EMBA Local 10}

 

FMBA Local 10 proposes that when a firefighter is transferred between
companies, the company to which the firefighter is transferred to must honor any
pending vacation requests and requests for days off or change days. Also, when
a firefighter is transferred to a tour after having selected vacation days, the days
will be available for selection in the tour from which the firefighter transferred

from.

53
The rationale for these proposals was advanced in the testimony of
Firefighter Padilla. According to Padilla, a firefighter selects his vacation in
December of the year prior to vacation. If the firefighter is transferred to another
fire company during the year, his or her “slot” may have been picked by another
firefighter leaving the transferred firefighter without a pick despite concrete
vacation plans that the firefighter may have made as early as the prior
December. Firefighter Padilla testified that the City has attempted to solve such
conflicts in the past. Based upon Firefighter Padilla's testimony, | award the

proposal with certain modifications. The award is as follows:

When a firefighter is transferred from one company to the next after
having selected his/her vacation in December, the company to
which the firefighter has been transferred will honor that vacation
selection so long as the days have not already been selected by
another firefighter who works in the tour to which the firefighter has
been transferred. In the event that another firefighter has already
selected the vacation days selected by the transferred firefighter
prior to his transfer, the company will make every reasonable effort
to permit the firefighter to retain his original vacation selection. A
decision as to whether the firefighter's prior vacation selection will
be honored will be made within 72 hours of the transfer. Any denial
of the prior vacation selection shall be in writing and accompanied
by reasons for the denial. The vacation days previously selected
by the transferred firefighter will be made available for selection by
another firefighter who remains assigned to the tour from which the
transferred firefighter had been assigned.

54
Light Duty (FMBA Local 10)

FMBA Local 10 proposes that any firefighter assigned or placed on light
duty to work the "5!" Platoon” should be placed on the same work schedule as

the firefighters and supervisors regularly assigned to the "5'" Platoon”.

According to the Union, this proposal would establish a uniform standard
for light duty for those placed on the “5% Platoon.” Testimony in support of this
proposal was offered by Firefighter Padilla. Firefighter Padilla testified that the
Agreement, at Article V(E), already provides for light duty and that this proposal
deals solely with the scheduling of work hours while on light duty. According to
Firefighter Padilla, firefighters who work the 5t" Platoon on a permanent basis
work four 9-hour days per week but that some firefighters who have been placed
on light duty on a temporary basis are assigned a work week of five 8-hour days.
After due consideration of the testimony, | decline to award this proposal.
Insufficient justification has been presented as to why all firefighters who are

placed on light duty must be placed on an identical work schedule.

  

Education Stipend (FMBA Local 10)

FMBA Local 10 currently receives educational stipends in the amount as

follows:

AA Degree $125
AA degree in fire science $250

55
BA or BS degree $250
BA or BS degree in fire science $500

The FMBA proposes that the educational stipend be increased to the following

levels:
AA Degree: $1,000.00
AA Degree in Fire Science $1,500.00
BA or ES Degree $1,500.00
BA or ES Degree in Fire Science $2,000.00

According to the FMBA, the current stipend is only nominal and does not
provide an incentive for an employee to obtain an advanced degree. It submits
that the City and its residents benefit by police officers obtaining educational
degrees. It further submits that the current stipend is not comparable to that paid

in other communities.

| do not award the FMBA’s proposal. Although it cannot be disputed that
there are benefits to be derived by an employee pursuing higher education, the
record reflects that the parties have reached prior agreement as to the level of
added compensation to be received for those who have already achieved a
degree. | do not find that a sufficient basis has been shown to award the change

proposed by the FMBA.

56
Life Insurance or Death Benefits (FMBA Local 10)

FMBA Local 10 proposes that its bargaining unit members receive a
Death Benefit identical to the one afforded to the Fire Superior Officers’
Association. Article XIll, Section G provides a death benefit in the amount of
$4,000. The term “death benefit’ in Section G is a life insurance benefit to be
distinguished from the $10,000 benefit in Article XIII, Section B which is paid to a
deceased firefighter's family for death resulting from an on-the-job injury. As I
noted in the award on this issue for the FOA, the PBA and SOA agreements
currently provide a $10,000 life insurance benefit. | awarded the $10,000 life
insurance benefit for the FOA to provide consistency with the PBA and SOA
agreements. Similarly, | award the $10,000 life insurance or “death benefit” for
members of FMBA Local 10. It shall be effective as soon as is administratively

feasible, but not later than ninety (90) days from the date of this Award.

Payroll Deferral (FMBA Local 10)

FMBA Local 10 proposes to incorporate terms of previous
settlements/memoranda relating to payroll deferral into the terms of the
agreement. | award this proposal subject to confirmation by the City that such
documents have been fully and officially executed in the manner asserted by the

Union

57
Form of Contract (FMBA Local 10)

FMBA Local 10 proposes that the City execute a formal contract and
provide copies to all FMBA members, incorporating all previous memoranda,

sidebars, and the results of this interest arbitration.

This proposal has merit and it is awarded in modified fashion. The record
reflects that the last fully executed collective negotiations agreement between the
parties expired on December 31, 2005. Thereafter, a Memorandum of
Agreement was entered into modifying the prior agreement through December
31, 2009. However, there was no fully executed collective negotiations
agreement replacing the one that expired on December 31, 2005. The FMBA
proposal would require the execution of a formal contract that includes the prior
fully executed prior agreement, the prior MOA, sidebars and the results of this
interest arbitration. | award the portion of the FMBA proposal except for the
reference to sidebars. While | agree that a new fully executed contract should
incorporate sidebar agreements, | do not award this portion of the proposal in the
absence of evidence as to the extent to which such sidebars exist. The parties
are free to, and should, incorporate such sidebar agreements during the process
of drafting the new agreement. In the event there is a lack of mutual agreement
to incorporate sidebars, such failure would not, in the event of a dispute, diminish
the rights of the FMBA to enforce the terms of the documents pursuant to the

language that appears in the sidebar documents.

58
Acting Superior Pay (FMBA Local 10)

FMBA Local 10 proposes to incorporate current practice for the
procedures to appoint acting superior officer opportunities and to establish the
pay rate on an hour for hour basis with no minimum hour requirement. The
applicable provision for this issue is Article IV Manpower. Under Article IV(a), a
firefighter who is required to serve as an Acting Captain or Man In Charge
receives Captain's pay but receives no additional compensation unless the

firefighter serves in an acting capacity for less than five (5) hours of the shift.

The FMBA’s proposal is in two parts. The first part is to incorporate
current practice as to appointment procedures. The record contains no evidence
contradicting testimony as to the current practice. Accordingly, | award this
portion of the FMBA’s proposal. The second portion of the FMBA proposal is to
eliminate the five (5) hour minimum requirement for additional compensation. |
have declined to award a similar proposal advanced by the FOA and also decline

to award this proposal advanced by the FMBA.

Salary/Wages for New Hires (FMBA Local 10)

 

FMBA Local 10 proposes to reduce the salary schedule by two steps for
new hires. It asserts that the eleven step schedule creates an incentive for

firefighters to leave City employment. | do not award this proposal. The salary

59
schedule for the FMBA. as well as a new hire schedule, shall be awarded in the

salary section of this Award.

Section 125 Plan (FMBA Local 10)

FMBA Local 10 proposes that the City establish a Section 125 plan to be
utilized for all healthcare contributions including but not limited to the current

1.5% health care contribution.

Chapter 78 of the Laws of 2011 provides legal authority for the City to
establish a cafeteria plan for its employees pursuant to Section 125 of the federal
Internal Revenue Code, 26 U.S.C. § 125 (See Local Finance Notice 2011-20R,
page 18). The 125 Plan would reduce an employee's tax obligation while the
employee's contribution levels have risen as a result of Chapter 78. Pursuant to
this authority, | award the FMBA Proposal so long as it conforms to the authority

provided to the City by this statute

Wireless Internet Service (FMBA Local 10)

 

FMBA Local 10 seeks to install and have usage of telephone, facsimile,
and wireless internet services within headquarters provided at the FMBA’s cost.

The FMBA offers the following rationale in its post-hearing submission:

60,
There

days so long as staffing level minimums are sufficient.

[T]he FMBA's proposal regarding wireless internet services
presents no impediment of any kind to the City while it would return
consistency to the Department, aid in restoring morale and even
enhance firefighter training. FF. Padilla explained that the proposal
consisted of allowing the FMBA to install and have usage of
telephone, facsimile, and wireless internet services within
headquarters provided at the FMBA’s cost. Historically, there has
been a past practice regarding this proposal as it was basically a
facilities issue with no capital expenditures. The FMBA has already
funded the costs of providing the necessary infrastructure and if
awarded, FMBA members still be subject to all Departmental rules
and regulations governing usage while on duty. FF. Padilla
described how this process was in place under for Chief DeMarzo
and that Chief Manganelli encouraged its use for training purposes,
thus proving this proposal would actually provide a benefit to the
Department itself and not just to the individual members of the
FMBA.

is merit to the FMBA proposal. | award the following language:

The FMBA shall be allowed to install and have usage of telephone,
facsimile, and wireless internet services within headquarters
provided at the FMBA's cost. Usage while on duty shall be subject
to departmental rules and regulations.

Personal Days (FMBA Local 10)

FMBA Local 10 proposes that its members be allowed to utilize personal

It also proposes that

He testified to practices, as well as a reorganization
Deputy Chiefs assigned to Administrative Staff at a savings of approximately
$200,000. The reorganization also reduced the number of firefighters required to
man a crew from thirteen (13) to ten (10). Firefighter Padilla complained that the
City uses an alleged lack of manpower as a basis to deny the use of a personal
day when twelve (12) scheduled firefighters are scheduled to man a crew. He
views this circumstance as providing for a full complement plus two (2)
firefighters. The FMBA argues that when the City sets the minimum number of
firefighters per crew at ten (10), the rationale for rejection of a personal day when

twelve (12) firefighters are scheduled is completely lacking.

Article XVI provides for personal days “subject to availability of
manpower’. There is merit to the FMBA proposal that when the City sets the
minimum staffing level at ten (10) firefighters, the denial of a personal day when
twelve (12) firefighters are scheduled to man the crew is inconsistent with the
language set forth in Article XVI(A). The FMBA acknowledges that it is not
seeking to negotiate over minimum staffing levels. It is apparent that this issue is
a matter of contract interpretation because it arises in a context of when the City
determines the minimum level of staffing it requires. This determination can vary.
I conclude that this issue is a matter of contract interpretation to be decided in the
context of the specific evidence that exists concerning staffing levels when a

personal day request is denied. For this reason, | do not award contract

62
language on the use of personal days and yield this matter to the parties’

grievance procedure

The other part of the FMBA’s proposal on personal days is to allow their
usage in twelve (12) hour blocks. The relevant contract language is at Article
XVI, Section C. It states “for purposes of this Article, a personal day shall be
8:00 a.m. to 6:00 p.m. or 6:00 p.m. to 8:00 a.m. A twenty-four (24) hour day shall
constitute two (2) personal days.” The FMBA’s complaint is that when a
firefighter decides to take one personal day that begins at 8:00 a.m. and ends at
6:00 p.m. the firefighter is required to return to the Department two hours before
an 8:00 p.m. roll call, thus subjecting the firefighter to two roll calls. | do not
award this proposal. The number of personal days and the time periods for the
use of those days are clearly set forth in the Agreement and insufficient evidence

has been provided to require a change in the language.

Payroll Deductions (FMBA Local 10)

FMBA Local 10 proposes that payroll shall remit payment to third parties
on the same date that payroll deductions are made by the employer. The FMBA
submits that the City has become frequently late in transmitting such payroll
deductions to third parties. Because of this, employees have been noticed on
occasion that they are subject to delinquency. There is merit to the FMBA

proposal. However, there is no certainty that the City, under the mandatory
language proposal, would be able to remit such payments on precisely the same

date that it makes other payroll deductions. | award the following language:

The City shall make reasonable efforts to remit payment to third
parties on the same date that payroll deductions are made by the

employer.

This is a conventional arbitration proceeding. As such, the arbitrator has
the authority to fashion the terms of an award without being restricted to
accepting either the final offer of the public employer or the final offer of an
employee organization on any individual issue. The arbitrator also has the
authority to deny in full or in part any proposal that has been advanced by any
party. In these three impasses, | conclude that none of the salary proposals can
be awarded because based upon the record developed at hearing, no final offer
of any party represents a reasonable determination of the salary issue. The
following findings are based upon the record evidence and form the basis for the

salary awards that I have issued.

The City's wage proposals are below the cost of living data. The Unions’

wage proposals are above the cost of living data. A salary award cannot be

66
directly tied to the cost of living data. While it may be a factor that influences a
wage result, it is only one of the many criteria that are relevant and entitled to
weight when making a wage determination. The weight to be given to this data
suggests an award higher than proposed by the City but lower than what has

been proposed by the Unions.

The record includes substantial evidence on comparability. The existing
wage structure for all units does not compare favorably with those employees
performing the same or similar services in public employment in similar
comparable jurisdictions. The jurisdictions in Essex County serve as a proper
basis for this conclusion. They can be considered as being within the local
operating area and all jurisdictions make contributions to the County government
based on equalized rates. They are the most comparable despite wide socio-
economic differences among the many municipalities. While a benefit, such as
maximum longevity of 14% of base salary is above average, the overall
compensation received at the time of contract expiration falls below most police
and firefighter bargaining units in Essex County. When the comparability
evidence is confined to the few Essex County municipalities that are most
comparable to Orange, such as East Orange and Irvington, the comparability
data is more favorable. The external contracts negotiated or awarded with
effective dates of January 1, 2010 going forward are relevant. A PERC Salary

Increase Analysis reflects a sharp decline in salary settlements beginning in

67
2009. Awards averaged 3.75% in 2009 and declined in 2010 to 2.88%, in 2011
to 2.05%, in 2012 to 1.86% and rose slightly in 2013 to 2.17%. Voluntary
settlements declined in 2009 to 3.6%, in 2010 to 2.65%, in 2011 to 1.87%, in
2012 to 1.80% and in 2013 to 1.88%. In respect to comparables, | give most
weight to the Irvington PBA Award of 1% in 2011, 1.5% in 2012, 2.0% in 2013
and 2.0% in 2014 as this municipality is most comparable to the City of Orange

when the standards for comparisons as set forth in the PERC Rules are applied.

The City’s wage proposal (3% over six (6) years for PBA Local 89 and
FMBA Local 10 and 3% over seven (7) years for FMBA Local 210, FOA) would
cause a broader gap in comparisons within Essex County generally and among
municipalities within the County that are the most comparable to Orange. Such a
result is not in consistent with the interests and welfare of the public and could
undermine department morale, interfere with continuity and stability of
employment and lessen the effectiveness of the public safety operation. The
Unions’ wage proposals 19.5% plus $1,000 for PBA Local 89 for seven (7) years
(exclusive of step or longevity movement), 18% for FMBA Local 10 for six (6)
years (exclusive of step or longevity movement) and 24% plus $1,000 for FMBA
Local 210, FOA over eight (8) years (exclusive of step or longevity movement)
would make for more favorable comparisons within Essex County generally and
among municipalities within the County that are most comparable to Orange.

However, these proposed increases are above the average increases in wages

68
in Essex County over the relevant time period. Moreover, the comparability data
must also be weighed and balanced with criteria concerning the financial impact
of such wage increases on the governing unit, its residents and taxpayers and
statutory restrictions imposed on the City, including the City's ability to comply
with the “appropriations cap” and the “tax levy cap.” When doing so, the Unions’
proposals are not reasonable and inconsistent with the interests and welfare of
the public. The Unions have made a forceful presentation that the City could
fund the costs of their proposals. But their projections do not factor in the City’s
obligation to fund other personnel and non-personnel costs that are attached to

its responsibilities that extend beyond public safety.

| next turn to comparisons within the City of Orange. There is little in the
way of internal comparability evidence for the years at issue. A chart depicting

internal comparisons over identical contract years is as follows:

69
The above internal comparisons must be viewed in the context of not only
their terms but also the time periods when the agreements were made. The
2009 wage agreements for PBA Local 89 and FMBA Local 10 came in the fourth
year of a four year agreement that commenced in 2006. While the FOA seeks a
similar increase for 2009, the financial evidence and the economic environment
is drastically different from that beginning in 2006 and for this reason cannot
support an award at that level. The Police SOA Local 89 wage agreements for
2009, 2010 and 2011 were the second, third and fourth years respectively of a
four year contract that commenced on January 1, 2008 and was executed in
November of 2008 and was “corrected” downwards in January 2009. This
agreement is of greater relevance because of the time period when it was
negotiated. But the weight the Unions seek to be given to the SOA agreement is
less strong than would be the case if the financial profile of the City had not
declined to the extent that it did in 2010 and 2011. The SOA agreement was
negotiated prior to the full impact of the deep recession on the City. The OPEIU
agreement involved non-public safety employees and contained 2% wage
increases in the third and fourth years in 2011 and 2012 that were offset by 4
furlough days in each contract year. There were no increases in the first two
years of the OPEIU agreement but 11 out of 22 employees who had been laid off

for budget reasons were rehired as a term of that agreement.

70
The continuity and stability of employment for police officers, firefighters
and fire superiors has not been shown to have been adversely impacted by wage
and benefit levels set forth in the respective collective negotiations agreements.
The City's proposal, if awarded, could alter this finding for prospective years
because wage levels would stagnate in relation to other jurisdictions. The overall
compensation currently received is comparatively low but the relative assets of
the City to fund its labor agreements must be taken into consideration as a
reason for wage disparities. It is reasonable to conclude that overall
compensation levels are in harmony with what the City has been able to afford
for the difficult and dangerous work performed by its public safety officers. An
improvement in those terms is warranted but the level of improvement must be
consistent with all of the statutory factors and not limited to salary comparisons

among the County's wealthiest municipalities.

A complicating factor in fashioning wage adjustments is that the City did
not encumber funds to fully plan for the cost of any retroactive payments for
wage increases that could be awarded for contract years 2010, 2011 and 2012
The Unions contend that this was caused by imprudent budgeting. However,
there are other factors that contributed to the City's budgeting. These include
losses in State aid and a declining real estate market. Further, official budget
documents reflect that the City did not appropriate funds up to its statutory

spending limitations nor raise revenues up to its statutory taxing authority during

n
these years. The City may be faulted for this but it cannot be assumed that its
taxpayers were able to absorb the tax increases (estimated at 21%) that would

have been required to make up the difference in the revenue loss

The record reflects that the City has been slowly recovering financially, Its
public releases indicate that redevelopment and revitalization of its properties
was ongoing despite the recession. Reductions in personnel costs and
increasing fund balances show that a reasonable level of wage increases and
retroactive payments can be made by the City beyond the level of wages it has
proposed. However, the salary terms proposed by alll three Unions would
adversely impact on the governing unit, its residents and taxpayers and would
impinge upon the City's ability to raise sufficient revenues to fund the proposals
within its spending and taxing limitations in order to fund the proposed increases.
The Unions have raised two additional considerations with respect to funding
They have been fully considered. First, | do not find the revenues from the City’s
Water and Sewer Utility to be relevant in funding the costs of the Unions’
proposals. Such funds are not predictable and are beyond the City is control
Second, the Unions have pointed out that the legislative imposition of health care
contributions as set forth in C. 2, P.L. of 2010 and C. 78, P.L. of 2011 have
caused reductions in take home pay for employees and helped with the City's

finances. While these observations are accurate, wage increases must be
awarded only as justified by the statutory criteria which do not include offsetting

the cost contributions with salary increases.

| first turn to the FOA negotiations and contract year 2009 in particular.
The FOA did not receive an increase in 2009 while the FMBA and PBA Local 89
received 4% increases (3%-1% split) during the last year of a four year
agreement (2006-2009). The Police SOA received a 3% increase in 2009 (2%-
1% split), the second year of a four year agreement. The FOA seeks a 3% wage
increase for 2009. The City's proposal for a zero wage increase in 2009 for the
FOA cannot be justified. It would cause a 4% reduction in the rank differential
within the fire department simply because the FOA, unlike the FMBA, the PBA
and the Police SOA, was not under contract for that year. However, the FOA’s
request for what is in essence a “parity” increase cannot be justified based solely
upon an internal comparison for one contract year that was negotiated in prior
years. All evidence points to the fact that the financial status of the City
underwent significant changes between the time that the 2006-2010 contracts
were negotiated and the negotiations for FOA’s contract year 2009. Under all of
the circumstances, | award an increase of 2% in 2009 for the FOA. However, the
effective date for this increase shall be deferred to 1% effective January 1, 2015
with the additional 1% effective January 1, 2016. | do not award retroactivity for
these increases due to the lack of availability of funds for the 2009 contract year

coupled with the financial impact of wage increases for this unit and the other

73
units in the ensuing years that will also require deferrals in retroactive pay for all
units based on the City's failure to encumber funds to pay for salary increases in

2010, 2011 and 2012.

I next turn to contract years 2010 through 2016. These contract years are
applicable to all three units. As indicated above, the record reflects that the City
voluntarily negotiated a contract with the Police SOA Local 89 containing three
(3%) percent wage increases (2%-1% split) for 2008, 2009, 2010 and 2011. The
Unions seek the same percentages for 2010 and 2011 based mainly, but not
exclusively, on this internal comparability consideration. The City rejects the
proposals asserting that there were fundamental changes in the economy and its
finances going into 2010 that make the Union's proposals for three (3%) percent
increases based upon a 2008 agreement incongruous with the events that

occurred thereafter.

The statutory criteria | deem most relevant for the resolution of this dispute
are financial impact, statutory limitations on the City and internal and external
comparability. In combination, the evidence on these factors are consistent with
a result that is in harmony with the interest and welfare of the public. These
criteria must be weighed and balanced. After doing so, | award common
increases at each step and rank for all three units of 1.5% for 2010, 1.5% for

2011, 1.5% for 2012, 1.5% for 2013, 1.5% for 2014, 1.5% for 2015 and 1.5% in

4
2016, effective each January 1 of each contract year Retroactivity for contract
years 2010, 2011 and 2012 shall be deferred. Retroactive payments shall be
made at 50% of what is due and payable during 2016 as soon after this Award as
is administratively feasible with the remaining 50% due and payable on the first
pay period that occurs in January 2017. Employees eligible for step increases
shall receive their annual step increases towards salary maximum. A new
modified salary schedule reflecting these increases shall be constructed and
placed into the new agreement.” Given the City’s financial obligations under the
terms | have awarded, | find that the Unions’ additional salary proposals must be
denied. These include PBA Local 89's proposal for $1,000 in First Responder
Pay and/or Certification Duties and/or 911 Certification Pay and the FOA’s

proposal for a $1,000 payment

The costs of funding the terms of the award have been shown by the
testimony and exhibits from the Unions’ financial expert to be within the City's
ability to fund without creating adverse financial impact and within the City's
statutory spending and tax levy limitations. While | do not agree that the City is
capable of funding the costs of the Unions’ proposals, the costs of the award are
less than half of what the Unions contend fall within the City's capability as
reflected in its comprehensive financial analysis. The terms of the Award have

attempted to ease the cost impact of the wage changes on the City. There is no

"Ido not award any changes in the structure of the existing salary schedule.

cost impact in contract year 2009 for the FOA until January 1, 2015. There is no
retroactive cost impact for contract years 2010, 2011 and 2012 until 2016 (50%)
and the end of the first pay period in 2017 (the remaining 50%). The funding for
contract years 2013 and beyond have been shown to be within the City's means
to fund due to several factors in the record that have not been rebutted,
including: the City’s unencumbered fund balance is increasing and approached
$4,000,000 by the end of 2013; the City’s tax collection rate rose significantly in
2013; there has been a substantial decrease in payroll costs in the PBA Local 89

and FMBA Local 10 bargaining units due to lower staffing levels.

Accordingly, and based upon all of the above, | respectfully submit the

following Awards:
