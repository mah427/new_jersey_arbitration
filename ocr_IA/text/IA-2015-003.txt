INTEREST ARBITRATION AWARD

BACKGROUND

On July 25, 2014, Fraternal Order of Police Lodge 91
(“FoR”) filed a Petition for Interest Arbitration with the
Public Employment Relations Commission (“the Commission”)
to initiate interest arbitration for a collective negotiations
agreement with the State of New Jersey, Division of Criminal
Justice (“the State” or “DCJ”). This is the parties’ first
collective agreement. Until 2010, DCJ detectives were
statutorily considered “confidential” employees, not eligible

for representation under the New Jersey Employer-Employee

 

Relations Act, N.J.S.A. 34:13A-1.1 et. seq. N.J.S.A. 52:17B-

 

100(b). However, effective January 18, 2010, that statute
was amended to remove the confidential designation of these
investigators as well as deputy attorneys general. FOP Lodge
91 was certified by the Commission on December 8, 2010 to
represent this unit of employees.’ The parties have been in
negotiations since that time, but have not succeeded in
concluding negotiations for the first contract.

On September 4, 2014, I was appointed to serve as interest

 

arbitrator by a random selection procedure pursuant to N.J

 

34:13A-16(e) (1). This statutory provision requires that an

award be issued within 90 days of my appointment. Both

© Separate negotiations units of detective sergeants and superior officers
were also certified at the same time. Petitions for interest arbitration
have been filed concerning negotiations in those units and tnose petitions
are pending at the Commission.

 
parties submitted Final Offers by October 17. As required by
the 2014 amendments to the interest arbitration statute, I
conducted mediation sessions with the parties, wherein
agreement was reached on a substantial number of non-economic
issues.

The State submitted a list of unit employees who were on
the payroll during the 12-month period immediately prior to
December 3, 2014 (the date the State proposes as the
effective date of the new contract). It also supplied a list
of employees who are on the payroll during the 12-month
period immediately prior to July 1, 2014 (the date the FOP
proposes as the effective date of a new contract). Both
lists contained employees’ anniversary dates, dates of
retirement or separation where applicable, and their
aggregate base pay paid during the respective 12-month
periods.

On October 21, 28, 29, 30, and 31, I conducted interest
arbitration hearings at the State Office of Employee Relations.
The State and the FOP each submitted extensive documentary
evidence and testimony.* At the close of the hearing, the
record was held open until November 4 only for the purpose of
providing the FOP an opportunity to refute the accuracy of
the State’s payroll data. No further submissions were

received, and the parties were advised that the record closed

 

 

State exhibits will be referred to as “S- “; ¥UE’s exhibits will be
referred to “FOP- *.
on November 4. Both parties submitted calculations of the
financial impact of their respective salary proposals. Post-
hearing briefs were filed by November 14, 2014.
FINAL OFFERS OF THE PARTIES

As this is the parties’ first collective agreement, both
parties submitted voluminous final offers on both economic
issues and non-economic issues. Because the final offers, taken
together, are more than 100 pages, I will summarize the issues
here, and treat them in full detail below.

The Union proposes salary increases and adjustments as
follows:

Effective 7/1/14 - 12% across the board increase to all unit
employees who were employed as of 6/30/14;

Effective 7/1/15 - Implement Salary “Range” changes as follow.

 

 

Title Current Salary Range Proposed Salary Range
Detective Trainee ¥95 y24
Detective II ¥24 ¥27
Detective I Y27 ¥32

- Detectives would move to the next highest step on the “Salary
Advancement Chart” that would provide them with a raise from
their base salary on June 30, 2015. No other salary increases
and/or movements would occur through June 30, 2016.

- Beginning in 2015, employees would advance on the salary guide
on January 1 each year instead of on their anniversary date
(currently employees at step 8 move on the guide after 18 months
and employees at step 9 move to step ten after 24 months).? Step
movement to occur in all years of the proposed agreement.

° It is unclear whether the FOP proposes this change in anniversary dates to
occur in vanuary, 2015 or in July, 2U1d.
The State proposes to continue the practice of advancing
unit employees on the salary guide on their anniversary in each
year of the agreement, and to increase employees’ salaries by a
1% across the board increase to the salary guide effective on
the first pay period after July 1, 2018.

In addition, the FOP proposes the following additional
economic items:

-Automatic advancement to Detective I after 5 years;
advance notice for schedule changes
-Overtime after 40 hours work
-Holiday Premium Pay

Weekend Differential

-Out Of Title Work Pay

-Minimum Call-In Pay

~Duty Officer Pay

-Compensation for Overnight Stay
-Uniform Main Allowance
-Reimbursement for Damaged Items
-Education Incentive Pay

-Changes in Comp Time Accrual
-Reduce Work Day to 8 Hours Including Paid Lunch
-Assignment of State Car

-Vacation Leave

-Vacation Cash-Out Upon Retirement.
-Sick Leave

-Sick Leave Cash-Out Upon Retirement
-Injury On Duty

-Terminal Leave

-Rereavement Leave
-Administrative Leave
-Union Leave Time
-Negotiations Time

-Health Benefits

-Health Benefit Contributions
-Health Benefits for Retirees
-Eye Care Plan

-Death Benefit

-Tuition Reimbursement

License & Continuing Education Reimbursement

Some of the FOP’s proposals on economic issues propose to
codify existing benefits; others propose new or enhanced
benefits. The State also proposed contract language on some of
the same economic issues. These proposals of both parties will
be reviewed sequentially.

In addition, the parties each proposed a plethora of non-
economic contract language clauses which will be reviewed
separately below. The State objected to some of the FOP’s
language proposals and filed several Scope of Negotiations
Petitions with the Commission asking that certain FOP proposals
be declared non-negotiable. On January 30, 2014, and on May 6,
2014, the Commission issued decisions finding certain subjects
were not negotiable. P.E.R.C. No. 2015-50 and P.E.R.C. No. 2015-
78. However, the Commission dismissed a third Petition (SN-
2015-029), filed October 21, 2014, as untimely and invited the
parties to address the issues in the interest arbitration

These issues will he discussed below.
STIPULATIONS OF THE PARTIES
At the beginning of the hearing, the parlies sLipulated to
the following facts:
1. FOP members move through the Y-24 and Y-27 salary
schedules through Step 8 in twelve (12) month

increment periods;

2. Step movement from Steps 8 to 9 in the Y-24 and Y-27
salary schedules is eighteen (18) months;

3. Step movement from Step 9 to Step 10 in the Y-24 and
Y-27 salary schedules is twenty-four (24) months;

4. FOP members have received increment payments in 2014;
and

5. Increments are paid to FOP members on their respective
anniversary dates.

In addition, the parties agreed upon a substantial amount
of language issues for the new contract. Due to the volume, T
have not replicated the agreed upon contract provisions in this
award. The parties have drafts of what was agreed upon. I
retain jurisdiction.

FINDINGS OF FACT

Mission of the Department

The State Division of Criminal Justice (“DCJ”) is in the
Department of Law and Public Safety and is derived from an
extension of the Attorney General’s role as the State’s Chief
Law Enforcement Officer.

Primarily, the Division is charged with the responsibility

to detect and prosecute the criminal business of the State and
to enforce the criminal laws. In addition, the Division
provides oversight and coordination within New Jersey’s law
enforcement community. It is the goal of the DCJ to coordinate
law enforcement efforts and cooperate to share resources within
criminal justice communities on the state, county, and municipal
levels, to ensure the safety and security of all New Jersey
citizens.

Organization of the DCJ:

The Division of Criminal Justice ("DCJ") is broken down
into a number of bureaus to address certain types criminal
offenses. The Division contains, amongst many others, the
following bureaus: (1) Corruption Bureau; (2) Gangs and
Organized Crime Bureau; (3) Financial and Computer Crimes
Bureau; and (4) Specialized Crimes Bureau. (S-22

The detectives of DCJ serve in all of the aforementioned
bureaus and task forces, in addition to carrying out the other
specialized law enforcement functions of the Division of
Criminal Justice such as: (1) supervising all the County
Prosecutor’s Offices; (2) comprising the Shooting Response Team
that investigates all State law enforcement officer shootings;
and (3) administering a training academy in Sea Girt, New Jersey
that trains all county prosecutor’s office investigators as well
as many other law enforcement officers.

Duties and Responsibilities of Detectives:

 

Until 2008, the law entorcement otticers in DCJ held the
title of “Investigator ~ Division of Law and Public Safety”. In
2008, the State Department of Civil Service reclassified the DCJ
titles to Detective Traince-State Investigator; Detective II
State Investigator; and Detective I-State Investigator. The
duties and responsibilities of each position are as follows:

Detective Trainee-State Investigator

 

Under immediate supervision of a superior officer in the
Division of Criminal Justice, a detective trainee assists in
performing specific field and office work relative to
criminal/civil violations of other state statutes; participates
in extensive field and office training on the operations
procedures, and policies of the Division; is authorized to
exercise all powers/rights of police officers in criminal
matters; is empowered to act as officer for the detection,
apprehension, arrest, and conviction of offenders against the
law; and does other related duties as required

According to the New Jersey Civil Service Commission Job
Specification, the employment title “Detective Trainee-Sstate
Investigator” includes, amongst many others, the following
duties:

Performs specified investigative work involving State
enforcement programs;

Prepares reports of routine nature during the course
of an investigation;

Participates in and observes the detecting, reporting
and following-up of criminal violations of New Jersey
statutes and regulations;
May assist in surveillance of certain aspects of
investigative operations to gain knowledge of illegal
activities in developing a case to prosecute violators
of New Jersey laws for casino operation; and

Exercises arrest procedures of criminal violators in
assisting an investigator to enforce state laws
governing the casino industry. (FOP-1

Detective II-State Investigator

 

Under supervision in the Division of Criminal Justice, a
Detective II performs varied investigative functions involved with
financial, compliance, and enforcement activities concerning
criminal violations of state statutes; is authorized to exercise
all powers and rights of police officers; is empowered to act as
an officer for the detection, apprehension, arrest, and conviction
of offenders against the law; and does other related duties as
required.

According to the New Jersey Civil Service Commission Job
Specification, the employment title “Detective II-State
Investigator” includes, amongst many others, the following
duties:

Conducts assigned investigations relating to alleged
or suspected violations of state law;

Conducts surveillance designed to apprehend
individuals engaged in criminal activity or to gather
investigative information;

Investigates fraud or misconduct;

Testifies before Grand Juries, Courts of Law, and
other judicial or administrative bodies; and uses
various types of electronic communications equipment
electronic surveillance equipment, photographic
equipment, recording devices, and database software

10
for investigative activities. (FOP-2
Detective I-State Investigator

Under supervision in the Division of Criminal Justice, a
Detective I performs varied investigative functions involved
with financial, compliance, and enforcement activities
concerning criminal violations of state statutes; is authorized
to exercise all powers and rights of police officers; is
empowered to act as an officer for the detection, apprehension
arrest, and conviction of offenders against the law; and does
other related duties as required

According to the New Jersey Civil Service Commission Job
Specification, the employment title “Detective I-State
Investigator” includes, amongst many others, the following
duties:

Performs various financial, compliance, and

enforcement investigations, including those of a

complex and difficult nature;

depth reports often of a highly technical business
nature or complex legal nature to be used by superior
officers in planning the next course of action to be
taken; and

May coordinate investigations with other law

enforcement authorities, and participate in joint
operations as required. (rOP-3)

1
In the capacity of law enforcement officers, detectives
investigate a wide variety of criminal allegations and/or
offenses, to include many that constitute complex and/or “high
profile” cases.

Additionally, based upon their Statewide jurisdiction, the
DCJ detectives frequently work alongside members of many other
law enforcement agencies. Most notably, the detectives work
with members of the New Jersey State Police on a consistent
basis in a variety of matters given both agencies fall under the
purview of the Department of Law and Public Safety and the State
Attorney General. DCJ detectives also work with members of the
Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI); Alcohol, Tobacco, and
Firearms (ATF); the various county prosecutor’s offices; and the
Drug Enforcement Agency (DEA) .

Responsibility for Contract Administration

 

The responsibility for negotiating and administering the
State's collective negotiations agreements with all of its
bargaining units rests primarily with the Governor’s Office of
Employee Relations (“OER”).

STATUTORY CRITERIA

I am required to make a reasonable determination of the
issues giving due weight to those factors set forth in N.J.S.A.

34:13A-16g(1) through (9) that I find relevant to the resolution

12
of these negotiations. These factors, commonly called the

statutory criteria, are as follows:

ay

The interests and welfare of the public. Among Lhe

items the arbitrator or panel of arbitrators shall
assess when considering this factor are the
limitations imposed upon the employer by (P.L. 1976,

Ge

(C. 40A:4-45.1 et seq.).

(2)Comparison of the wages, salaries, hours, and
conditions of employment of the employees involved in

the arbitration proceedings with the wages, hours, and
conditions of employment of other employees performing
the same or similar services and with other employees

generally:

(3)

(a) In private employment in general;
provided, however, each party shall have the
right to submit additional evidence for the
arbitrator's consideration.

(b) In public employment in general;
provided, however, each party shall have the
right to submit additional evidence for the
arbitrator's consideration.

(c) In public employment in the same or
similar comparable jurisdictions, as
determined in accordance with section 5 of
B.L, 1995. c. 425 (C.34:13A-16.2) provided,
however, each party shall have the right to
submit additional evidence concerning the
comparability of jurisdictions for the
arbitrator's consideration.

   

The overall compensation presently received by

the employees, inclusive of direct wages, salary,
vacations, holidays, excused leaves, insurance and
pensions, medical and hospitalization benefits, and
all other economic benefits received.

(4)

(8)

Stipulations of the parties.

The lawful authority of the employer. Among the

items the arbitrator or panel of arbitrators shall
assess when considering this factor are the
limitations imposed upon the employer by the P.L. 1976
c. 68 (C.40A:4-45 et_seq).

13
(6) The financial impact on the governing unit, its
residents and taxpayers. When considering this
factor in a dispute in which the public employer is a
county or a municipality, the arbitrator or panel of
arbitrators shall take into account to the extent that
evidence is introduced, how the award will affect the
municipal or county purposes element, as the case may
be, of the local property tax; a comparison of the
percentage of the municipal purposes element, or in
the case of a county, the county purposes element
required to fund the employees’ contract in the
preceding local budget year with that required under
the award for the current local budget year; the
impact of the award for each income sector of the
property taxpayers on the local unit; the impact of
the award on the ability of the governing body to (a
maintain existing local programs and services, (b.
expand existing local programs and services for which
public moneys have been designated by the governing
body in a proposed local budget, or (c) initiate any
new programs and services for which public moneys have
been designated by the governing body in its proposed
local budget.

(1) The cost of living.

(8) The continuity and stability of employment
including seniority rights and such other factors not
confined to the foregoing which are ordinarily or
traditionally considered in the determination of
wages, hours and conditions of employment through
collective negotiations and collective bargaining
between the parties in the public service and in
private employment.

(9) Statutory restrictions imposed on the employer
Among the items the arbitrator or panel of arbitrators
shall assess when considering this factor are the
limitations imposed upon the employer by section 10 of
P.L. 2007, c. 62 (C.40A:4-45.45).

The Arbitrator’s award must address all nine statutory
criteria, identify the criteria found to be relevant, analyze
all of the evidence pertaining to the relevant criteria, and

explain why any remaining criteria were deemed irrelevant. "A

tion along those lines should satisfy the

 

14
 

requirement for a decision based on those

judge relevant." Borough of Hillsdale and PBA, 137 N

 

 

(1994). Any economic offers thal are clearly unreasonable
in light of the statutory criteria must be rejected.

In arriving at the terms of this award, I conclude that
all of the statutory factors are relevant, but not all are
entitled to equal weight. It is widely acknowledged that in
most interest arbitration proceedings, no single factor can be
determinative when fashioning the terms of an award. This
observation is present here as judgments are required as to
which criteria are more significant and as to how the relevant
evidence is to be weighed

In addition, I note that N.J.S.

 

. 34:13A-16g(8) requires
consideration of those factors ordinarily or traditionally
considered in the determination of wages, benefits, and
employment conditions. One such consideration is that the
party proposing a change in an employment condition bears the
burden of justifying the proposed change. Another
consideration is that any decision to award or deny any
individual issue in dispute, especially those having economic
impact, will include consideration as to the reasonableness of
that individual issue in relation to the terms of the entire
award. I am also required by statute to determine the total
net annual economic cost of the terms required by the Award

The factor of inlernal comparability, based upon existing

a5
Commission and court precedent, is a factor that is not only
specifically addressed in the statutory criteria [N.J.S.A.
34:13A-16g(2) (c)], but also has been found to fall within the
criteria of the "interests and welfare of the public" and the
"continuity and stability of employment." The Commission has
held, “Pattern is an important labor relations concept that is
relied upon by both labor and management ... deviation from a
settlement pattern can affect the continuity and stability of
employment by discouraging future settlements and undermining
employee morale in other units." County of Union, P.E.R.C.
No. 2003-33, 28 NJPER 459,461 (433169, 2002). An interest
arbitration award that does not give due weight to an
internal pattern is subject to reversal and remand. County of
Union, P.E.R.C. No. 2003-87, 29 NJPER 250,253 (475, 2003).

Further, an internal pattern of settlement properly
focuses on the terms of economic improvement offered in a
given round of negotiations. See, Somerset County Sheriff's
Office v. FOP Lodge #39, Docket No. A-1899-06T3, 34 NJPER &
(App. Div. 2008) and County of Passaic, PERC No. 2010-42 and
PERC No. 2011-36 [cites].

In this matter, the interests and welfare of the public
must be given the most weight. It is a criterion that
embraces many other factors and recognizes the

interrelationships among all of the statutory criteria. Among

16
those factors that interrelate and require the greatest scrutiny
in this proceeding are the evidence on internal comparability

and comparability to other jurisdictions [

 

S.A. 34:13A-

16g(2)(c)]z the financial impact of an award on the governing

 

body and taxpayers [N.J.S.A. 34:13A-16g(6)]; the employees
existing compensation and benefits; the impact upon
continuity and stability of the bargaining unit, including
employee morale and turnover; and the cost of living

DISCUSSION
CONTRACT DURATION:

The FOP proposes a five-year contract retroactive to July
1, 2014 and extending through June 30, 2019. The State offers a
contract beginning on the date of this award and continuing
through June 30, 2019.

Neither party presented arguments in their respective
briefs explaining the rationale for their proposed starting
dates for the new contract. I intend to award effective dates
for the new contract for the full five-year period extending
from July 1, 2014 through June 30, 2019. This term is
consistent with every other contract the State has with its
multiplicity of bargaining units, including the recently
negotiated contract with the IBEW for its newly certified unit
of Deputy Attorneys General. I award the following

July 1, 2014 ~ June 30, 2019. Unless otherwise
specified, all provisions of this contract shall not

Bh)
be retroactive and shall apply beginning December 3,
2014.
SALARIES AND STEP GUIDES:
The threshold issue in this matter is whether a 2% “hard
cap” applies to awarded salary increases in this matter.

N.J.S.A. 34:13A-16.7(b) provides:

 

An Arbitrator shall not render any award pursuant to
section 3 of P.L. 1977, ¢.85 (C.34:13A-16) which, on
an annual basis, increases base salary items by more
than 2.0 percent of the aggregate amount expended by
the public employer on base salary items for the
members of the affected employee organization in the
twelve months immediately preceding the expiration of
the collective negotiation agreement subject to
arbitration; provided, however, the parties may agree
or the arbitrator may decide, to distribute the
aggregate money value of the award over the term of
the collective negotiation agreement in unequal annual
percentages. An award of an arbitrator shall not
include base salary items and non-salary economic
issues which were not included in the prior collective
negotiations agreement.

The State argues that this statutory limitation applies to
this award. It contends that any other conclusion would be
illogical and contrary to the legislative intent. The State
avers that any reasonable interpretation of the relevant
amendments to the Interest Arbitration Act must conclude that
the 28 cap applies here. The relevant provision concerning the
effective date of the amendments provides:

This act shall take effect January 1, 2011; provided

however, section 2 of P.L.2010, c.105 (C.34:13A-

16.7) [the “cap” provision] shall apply only to

collective negotiations between a public employer and

the exclusive representative of a public police
department or public fire department that relate to

18
negotiated agreements expiring on that effective date
or any date thereafter until or on December 31, 2017,
whereupon, after December 31, 2017, the provisions of
section 2 of P.L.2010, c.105 (C.34:13A-16.7) shall
become inoperative for all parties except Lhuse whose
collective negotiations agreements expired prior to or
on December 31, 2017 but for whom a final settlement
has not been reached.

 

This act shall take effect immediately and shall be
retroactive to April 2, 2014.

N 34:13A-16.9.

 

s

 

This matter concerns a newly established negotiations unit
and a first contract. At issue is a first contract.

Ostensibly, the Union would have the Arbitrator conclude that
because there is no “expiring” negotiations agreement, the 2%
cap does not apply. Such a conclusion is erroneous as it
ignores the precepts of statutory construction and is contrary
to the Legislature’s intent.

Further, the State contends that the Union's
interpretation, taken to its logical extreme, would lead to the
absurd result that the interest arbitration act does not apply
to first contracts.

The State continues that N.J.S.A. 34:13A-16 through -21 is
the section of the New Jersey Employer-Employee Relations Act
commonly referred to as the “Interest Arbitration Act.” Nowhere
in the Act is reference made to agreements for newly formed
negotiations units or first contracts. To the contrary,
reference is made throughout the entire Act to expiring
collective negotiations agreements. For example, the provisions

19
setting forth the precursors to interest arbitration provide as
follows:

Negotiations between a public fire or police
department and an exclusive representative concerning
the terms and conditions of employment shall begin at
least 120 days prior to the day on which their
collective negotiation agreement is to expire. . .

 

 

The first of those three meetings shall take place no
later than the 90th day prior to the day on which

their collective negotiation agreement is to expire.

 

Prior to the expiration of their collective
negotiation agreement, either party may file an unfair
practice charge with the commission alleging that the

other party is refusing to negotiate in good faith

N.J.S.A. 34:13A-16 a. (1) (emphasis supplied).

 

 

In terms of the initiation of the interest arbitration
process, the Interest Arbitration Act provides:

Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraph (2) of
subsection a. of this section or paragraph (1) of this
subsection, either party may petition the commission
for arbitration on or after the date on which their
collective negotiation agreement expires. The petition
shall be filed in a manner and form prescribed by the
commission. The party filing the petition shall notify
the other party of its action. The notice shall be
given in a manner and form prescribed by the
commission. N.J.S.A. 34:13A-16 b. (2

  

The State continues that, no one can credibly argue that
the Legislature did not intend for the Interest Arbitration Act
to apply to newly created police and fire negotiations units.
Therefore, the Union cannot “cherry pick” and interpret
provisions that only reference expired agreements as conferring

the right to interest arbitration but contend that the provision

20
capping awards does not apply because it only references

agreements “expiring on that effective date or any date

 

thereafter . . .” N.J.S.A. 34:13A-16.9.

Further, the State argues that the “effective date”
provision of the interest arbitration statute was not intended
to exclude negotiations for first contracts. In amending the
interest arbitration statute in 2011, the Legislature clearly
set forth an effective date of January 1, 2011. The Legislature
further clarified that the “cap” provision would “apply only
collective negotiations between a public employer and the
exclusive representative of a public police department or public
fire department that relate to a negotiated agreement expiring
on that effective date [January 1, 2011] or any date thereafter.

This language establishes a bright line and forestalls any
challenges to the statute based upon retroactivity. There is no
evidence that language was intended to exclude first contracts
any more than the reference to contract expiration dates in the
preceding provisions was intended to exclude first contracts
from the Interest Arbitration Act altogether. Rather, newly
formed units -- such as those at issue here -- are not in the
statute. However, having afforded itself the right to invoke
interest arbitration under the statute, the Union must accept
all the constraints that currently exist under the law —-

including the 2% cap.

al
The State argues that, given that there is no expiring
agreement, the proper focus for newly formed units should be on
the effective date of an agreement. Here, that effective dale
will be either July 1, 2014 (based on the Union’s proposal) or
December 3, 2014 (using the State’s proposal). Thus, this
contract, regardless of which proposal one were to analyze, will
commence well-after the effective date of the 2% cap and, thus
no basis exists to exclude this group from its application. Any
other result would require this Arbitrator to treat this group
of employees differently from all other law enforcement
personnel with contracts effective on or after January 1, 2011
Nothing in the Legislation or in the dire economic conditions
that precipitated the 2% cap suggests that a newly formed unit
can have any less detrimental impact on the budget of a public
employer than existing units that would justify such an
exclusion.

The State maintains that the legislative intent of imposing
a 2% cap on base salary awards is plain on the face of the
statutory amendments -- to lessen the burden on financially
stressed public employers of police and fire personnel. As
stated above, interpreting the language in the Interest
Arbitration Act in a literal and restrictive manner would lead
to the absurd result of excluding first contracts from interest
arbitration. Such a result is contrary to the precepts of

statutory interpretation as “[t]he language of a statute ‘must

22
be read perceptively and sensibly with a view toward fulfilling

the legislative intent.’” Association of Municipal Assessors,

 

225 N.J. Super. 475 481 (1988) (quoting Unemployed-Employed

Council of N.J. Inc. v. Horn, 85 N.J. 646 (1981).

 

For example, in In The Matter of the Denial of the

 

Application of Giles W. Casaleggio for a Retired Law Enforcement

 

Officer Permit to Carry a Hand Gun, 420 N.J. Super. 121 (App

 

Div.) (2011), the court concluded that Casaleggio, a former
prosecutor and Deputy Attorney General in the Division of
Criminal Justice, was not eligible for a gun permit afforded to
retired “full-time members of a state law enforcement agency.”
Id. at 128. In essence, the court conceded Casaleggio met a
broad definition of “law enforcement officer” but noted a “broad
prohibition.” Id. at 123. The court noted:

To decide Casaleggio’s first claim, we must consider

the legislative intent behind N.J.S.A. Although our

starting point is to ‘ascribe to the statutory words

their ordinary meaning and significance,’ we recognize

In this matter, the Arbitrator should heed the principles

enunciated by the Casaleggio and the NJ Democratic Party courts.

 

The Interest Arbitration Act does not expressly preclude the
application of the 2% cap to first contracts and the issue as to
whether it should apply must be determined in light of its

essential purpose and design; to wit, to lessen the burden on

24
financially stressed public employers. Thus, the State

concludes that declining to apply the 2% cap provision to this

 

matter would be contrary Lu Lhe Legislative intent and common
sense.

The FOP argues that no cap applies to this award. It cites
the specific language of N.J.S.A. 34:13A-16.9 which provides

This act shall take effect January 1, 2011;
provided however, section 2 of P.L. 2010,
¢.105 (C.34:13A-16.7) shall apply only to
collective negotiations between a public
employer and the exclusive representative of
a public police department or public fire
department that relate to negotiated
agreements expiring on that effective date
or any date thereafter until or on December
31, 2017, whereupon, after December 31

2017, the provisions of section 2 of
P.L.2010, c.105 (C.34:13A-16.7) shall become
inoperative for all parties except those
whose collective negotiations agreements
expired prior to or on December 31, 2017 but
for whom a final settlement has not been
reached. (emphasis added

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

The FOP continues that, according to the express wording of
this provision, the 2% cap shall only apply to: (1) collective
negotiations between a public employer and the exclusive
representative of a public police and/or fire department; and
(2) those negotiations must relate to a negotiated agreement
expiring on the effective date of the act, January 1, 2011, or
any date thereafter until December 31, 2017. The FOP maintains
that there is no dispute that the first prong of the test is
satisfied; these DCJ detectives are members of a public law

enforcement department.

25:
However, the FOP maintains that this interest arbitration
does not relate to a negotiated agreement expiring on January 1,
2011 or any dale Lhereafter until December 31, 2017. Kather,
the instant collective negotiations and/or interest arbitration
proceedings with the State relate to the drafting of an initial
collective bargaining agreement. As such, the FOP contends that
no agreement is set to expire and, thus, the criteria for the
two percent (2%) cap to apply cannot be met.

The FOP argues that the clear, unambiguous wording of
N.J.S.A. 34:13A-16.9 is controlling and provides that the two
percent (28) cap does not apply to the instant interest
arbitration. It avers that the State’s assertion to the
contrary is without merit and in direct contravention of the
express wording of controlling statute

Further, the FOP argues that this conclusion is further
reinforced by the legislative history surrounding the recent
et

amendments to N.J.S.A. 34:13A-16, seq. in June 2014. Under

  

the prior statutory language that expired on April 1, 2014, a
Police and Fire Public Interest Arbitration Task Force
(hereinafter “Task Force”) was created to study the interest
arbitration process and make recommendations concerning its
continued use in connection with police and fire labor contract
disputes. N.J.S.A. 34:13A-16.8(e) (2). The Task Force was
comprised of eight members: four appointed by the Governor; two

appointed by the Senate President; and two appointed by the

26
Speaker of the General Assembly. The Task Force was statutorily
charged with issuing a final report to the Governor and the
Legislature before April 1, 2014 and to include any specific
recommendations for any amendments to the arbitration award cap
in addition to any other findings and recommendations concerning
the interest arbitration process.

The Task Force issued its Final Report to the Governor and
Legislature on March 19, 2014. (FOP-19) Within the body of the
report, the Task Force made four unanimous recommendations
namely: (1) to increase the number of days to complete the
interest arbitration process from 45 days to 90 days; (2) to
increase the 30-day time period to 60 days for PERC to decide an
appeal of an interest arbitration award; (3) to increase the
arbitrator's maximum compensation from $7,500.00 to $10,000.00;
and (4) to increase the time period to appeal an interest
arbitration award from seven days to 14 days. Id. at pp. 16-18.
In the new legislation passed on June 24, 2014, all four of
these unanimous recommendations were incorporated into the new
law. Therefore, the Union argues, it is evident the Legislature
took the recommendations of the Task Force into account and
relied heavily upon the same when revising the law and passing
the new legislation.

The Union notes that, included within the Task Force's

final report was also additional recommendations and comments

27
made specifically by the appointees of the Governor

Specifically, the final report states on page 20:

 

N.J.S.A. 34:13A-16.9 currently provides that
the 2% base salary cap shall expire on April
1, 2014. The four appointees of the
Governor to the Task Force strongly
recommend that the law be amended to remove
the “sunset” provision and have the cap
continue without a date limitation as to the
number of agreements to which it would
apply. Moreover, they recommend that this
cap apply to newly-certified units which
have not had an initial collective
negotiations agreement prior to the
effective date of the law, January 1, 2011.
[Emphasis Added. ]

 

 

 

 

 

 

The FOP notes that David Cohen, the former Director of the
Governor's Office of Employee Relations, served as the Task
Force Chairman. The FOP points out that Cohen played a lead
role in negotiating for the State concerning the newly certified
DCJ bargaining units.

The Union argues that the Task Force’s recommendation to
include this new language amounts to a concession by the State
that it was aware that the 2% cap did not apply to newly
certified units which did not have an initial collective
bargaining agreement prior to January 1, 2011.

The FOP maintains that, taking this one step further, the
“new” version of the (2%) cap is not applicable in the instant
interest arbitration proceeding since the language was never
amended to incorporate such wording as recommended by the Task

Force.

28
Further, the Union argues that this concept is also
bolstered by the fact the Legislature reviewed the Task Force's
Final Report prior to making the most recent legislative changes
to the interest arbitration process. Therefore, the Legislature
was aware of the recommendation to change the express wording of
the law to ensure the 2% cap apply to newly certified units
without a collective negotiations agreement. However, despite
the recommendation being explicitly delineated in the Task
Force’s Report, the Legislature chose not to include the
recommended language in the amended legislation. As a result
the Union asserts, the question as to whether the 2% cap applies
to the instant interest arbitration is well-settled; clearly it
does not.

Lastly, the Union argues that the non-applicability of the
2% cap in the instant proceeding is logical as a matter of
practicality. As the Arbitrator is aware, the 2% cap is based
upon the aggregate amount expended by the employer on “base
salary” items for unit employees in the twelve months
immediately preceding the expiration of the collective
negotiation agreement subject to arbitration. As such, no
definitive timeframe to determine an “aggregate amount” expended
can be determined since no collective negotiations agreement
between the parties currently exists

To illustrate this point within the context of the instant

interest arbitration, the Union notes that the State is seeking

29
to have the new contract commence on the date the interest
arbitration award is ultimately issued. Assuming the interest
arbitration award in this matter is rendered on December 3,
2014, it is impossible to know what the State has paid in “base
salary” items for DCJ detectives from December 3, 2013 until
December 4, 2014. Therefore, the calculation of the base year
would be purely speculative.

The starting point is the statutory language

3A-16.9 provides:

 

This act shall take effect January 1, 2011;
provided however, section 2 of P.L. 2010
¢.105 (C.34:13A-16.7) shall apply only to
collective negotiations between a public
employer and the exclusive representative of
a public police department or public fire
department that relate to negotiated
agreements expiring on that effective date
or any date thereafter until or on December
31, 2017, whereupon, after December 31

2017, the provisions of section 2 of P.L.
2010, c.105 (C.34:13A-16.7) shall become
inoperative for all parties except those
whose collective negotiations agreements
expired prior to or on December 31, 2017 but
for whom a final settlement has not been
reached.

Section 2 of P.L. 2010 contains the 2% cap restrictions. The

 

plain wording of the statute states that section 2 “shall only
apply” to negotiations relating to contracts that expire on or
before January 1, 2011. Here, there was no prior contract to

expire. Therefore, a literal reading of the statutory language

30
can only reach the conclusion that the Section 2 does not apply
Moreover, the Commission affirmed this notion that the statutory
references to “contracts expiring” refer to the parties’ last
contract and it suggests that the statute be given its plain
meaning. Burlington County Prosecutor, P.E.R.C. No. 2012-61,

NJPER oi )+ Borough of Bloomingdale, P.E.R.C.

 

No. 2011-70, 37 NJPER 143 (443 2011)

More significantly, the Interest Arbitration Task Force’s
final report and recommendations to the legislature issued in
March, 2014, addressed this very issue. Those recommendations
addressed the issue of the applicability of Section 2 to newly
formed negotiations units. Specifically, the Task Force
recommended that the statute be amended to include language that
the cap apply to newly-certified units which have not had an
initial collective negotiations agreement prior to the effective
date of the law, January 1, 2011. While the legislature did
adopted the other four recommendations of the Task Force in
amendments to the statute, it declined to include this
recommendation. Therefore, even if it could be argued that the
legislature initially presumed that all police groups had an
existing contractual relationship and ignored situations
involving newly certified units, the legislature's rejection of
this amendment shows its intent not to apply a cap in such

situations.

31
Moreover, the logic of the situation dictates the exemption
of this group from the cap. The point of limiting the original
2011 2% cap to only future contracts appears to be a recognition
that units with a contract expiration date of December 31, 2010
and before would already be in negotiations at the time the
statute was enacted. It appears that the law intended to
grandfather such units. Here, the FOP was certified in December
2010 -- before the cap law became effective. The FOP could have
sought a contract period beginning in January 1, 2011.
Therefore, they are in a parallel position to those bargaining
units whose contracts expired December 31, 2010 -- the very
groups the legislature exempted from the cap.

For the foregoing reasons, I find that the 2% cap on the
arbitrator’s award does not apply to the instant interest

arbitration.

PARTIES’ SALARY ARGUMENTS

The Union argues that its salary proposal should be awarded
primarily based upon the fact that the comparability data shows
that DCJ detectives are about 12% below the average pay rate for
detectives employed by the various county prosecutors and below
the average pay of State Troopers. More importantly, the FOP
points to the fact that salaries of unit employees have been
effectively frozen since 2008. It seeks to make up lost ground

in this award.

32
The State argues that Young’s analysis of the financial
impact of the Union’s proposal is based on a faulty premise
The FOP asks whether Lhe State has the financial ability to
accommodate such requests, but the State argues this is
misplaced. The State argues the “financial impact” criterion,
N.J.$-A. 34:13A-16(g) (6), requires an arbitrator to consider the
financial impact of an award on the State, not the ability to
pay but whether the award would create a “substantially
detrimental result.” Hillsdale. It asserts that the Union
wrongly stated that awarding the Union's proposal would not have
a substantially detrimental result.

The State argues that Young’s analysis of the State's
fiscal health is based on stale data and faulty reasoning. In
support of the conclusion that the finances of the State are
improving, Young erroneously relied on data and statements from
FY14 Budget Summary presented in February 2013. The State's
budget expert Peden stated that the summary document was
Presented in February of 2013 and the economic data quoted there
is data as of December 2012, and thus, not relevant to the
State’s current fiscal health. The State argues that Young’s
report should be disregarded

The State also argues that the State’s Budget between FY
2010 through FY 2014 continues to be severely strained. The
State’s unemployment rate as of August 2014 was 6.6%, 33rd

highest in the country; the State did not achieve its revenue

33
Projections for FY2014 by $1.3 billion, and is experiencing
another major shortfall in FY 2015 of $1.8 billion. The state
argues as of Lhe hearing date its revenues had not even
rebounded to the FY 2008 level. The State argues its revenue
situation does not reflect the continued improvement the Union
suggests. The FY 2014 State’s fund balance was only 1% of the
expenditures and 1.1% of the FY 2015 projected expenditures

The fund balance is a cushion against extraordinary events
like revenue shortfalls and unforeseen circumstances. The
accepted fund balance benchmark is that the ending surplus
should be 5% or greater, as recommended by the National
Association of State Budget Offices, Center for Budget Policy
and Priorities, and the National Council of State Legislatures.
The FY 2015 budget demonstrates a continued trend of small fund
balances. The FY 2015 projected fund balance is 1.1% of
expenditures. As a result, the State’s credit rating has been
down=graded and is in next to last position nationally; this
will increase the cost of the State’s debt service

The State’s non-discretionary expenditures comprise the
largest and fastest growing parts of the budget. The largest
percentage increases in State expenditures continues to be in
pension, health benefits and debt services. In the $32.5
billion FY 2015 budget, the largest expenditures are for state
Aid (41.28) and Grants-In-Aid (30.1%) of the budget -- both

mandated programs.

34
The State argues that the future does not hold much relief
for the State’s ability to control significant portions of its
pudget. For example, State employee health benefits cost are
expected to grow to $6.5 billion over the next 10 years and
devour 14% of State revenue. In addition, $1.582 billion was
budgeted as a mandatory State pension contribution, but as a
result of the revenue shortfall, the State lapsed approximately
$882 million of that contribution. Finally, as an additional
way to address the revenue shortfall, the legislature cut
various line items of the budget by approximately $40 million

The State argues that the Union’s wage proposal
significantly increases the Division’s already-stretched budget.
The Division's total budgeted expenditures are $31.5 million
No matter which cost-calculation is used, the Union’s wage
proposal is a significant percent of the total Division's
budget. Over the past five years the Division expenditures have
been reduced by 0.6% and have remained flat for the past three
cycles. Despite this, the State avers that the FOP proposes
salaries that amount to 10% of the total Division budget, which
does not include salary adjustments for the sergeants or
lieutenants.

The financial impact criterion involves an analysis of
whether the award would create “substantially detrimental
result.” I£ awarded, the Union's proposal for an almost 35%

wage increase would have a tremendously negative financial

35
impact on the State in payouts exceeding four times the
statutory salary cap, and in the ripple effect on negotiations
with other units

The State argues that the Union’s expert's analysis and
conclusions regarding the Consumer Price Index (“CPI”) must be
disregarded. The expert’s comparison of the unit’s “yearly”
wage to CPI, failed to factor in step increases and thus his
conclusions that the detectives’ wage increases are
substantially below the rate of inflation is categorically
wrong.

A comparison of settlements negotiated with other law
enforcement and civilian units supports awarding the State's
final offer. The parties’ final offers must be reviewed in
comparison with the wages and benefits the State provided to its
other employees as “internal comparables.” N.J.S.A.34:13A-
16g(2) (c). The evidence submitted by the State overwhelmingly
demonstrates that its final offer is consistent with the wage
increases received by the State’s other represented employees
particularly the State’s comparable lew enforcement units in the
last contract cycle. Given the current state of the State's
budget as shown above and the existence of the 2% cap, nothing
would suggest that future settlements will result in any greater

increases. See, Somerset Cty. Sheriff's Officers, (court

Young failed to consider State law enforcement CNA for the
2011-2015 period other than State Troopers. The increases Young
omitted compare favorably to the State’s final offer. Contract
settlements with the State’s civilian units further support
awarding the State’s final wage offer. Young’s analysis also
failed to take into account the civilian contract settlement
trends established in the last State negotiation cycle. The
contracts established the following across-the-board pattern

This pattern of voluntary settlements demonstrates that
other State negotiations representatives continue to recognize
the State’s fiscal condition. Young did not analyze its final
offer compared to the civilian settlements

The State further argues that a comparison with comparable
positions in other jurisdictions supports awarding its final

offer, NJ

 

A. 34:13A-16g(2) (c) requires that wages, salaries,
and conditions of employment of public sector employees in

similar or comparable jurisdictions be considered. The

38
settlements in the County Prosecutors’ offices throughout the
State show a trend of declining increases. The average yearly
wage increase for the jurisdictions listed is 1.4%. The average
increase demonstrates a trend of modest increases throughout the
State. The State’s final wage offer is consistent with the
current trends. N.J.S.A. 34:13A-16.7(b)

The salaries of the FOP’s unit members are within the
Statewide range of detectives’ and investigators’ salaries
Young’s report emphasizes the difference between the Division’s
detectives’ median and mean salaries as compared to the county
median and mean. The data shows the Division’s median is $8,631
less than the counties’ median and $9,663 less than the
counties’ mean salaries. Young failed to explain the
calculation that lead to this conclusion. Young’s assertion
provides no basis for the arbitrator to award the Union’s wage
proposal. In fact, for those benchmarks in 2013 the Division
ranked 17 out of 22 in both categories. The Division’s
detectives are paid less on average than their county
counterparts. However, there is nothing in Young’s report to
conclude that the detectives should be paid more than the
average. Moreover, nothing in the interest arbitration statute
suggests that an average wage rate alone is sufficient to
justify an increase without any analysis of whether some of the
various jurisdictions which comprise the average are

“comparable.” ‘here is a range of average salaries with a

39
$50,918 spread and the Division’s salaries fall within that
range.

An analysis of voluntary settlements in interest
arbitration-eligible units and arbitration awards militates
against awarding the Union’s excessive wage proposal. The
Union's proposal far exceeds the average of voluntary
settlements for arbitration-eligible units and arbitration
awards as reported in the “Final Report of the Police and Fire
Public Interest Arbitration Impact Task Force” dated March 19,
2014. The overall average salary increases were 2.11% for
voluntary settlements outside the IA process, 1.84% for
settlements after IA initiation and 1.92% for Interest
Arbitration Awards. Other economic comparative data establishes
that the detectives are well positioned as it relates to their
salaries and the proposed increase. For example, the national
annual mean salary for detectives and criminal investigators is
$58,550 as compared to the detective’s mean of $85,849.
Further, the detective’s average median salary is $85,849 which
is $14,212 higher than the median for the household income for
New Jersey ($71,637). Finally, the State’s proposed 18 wage
increase together with increments compares favorably with the
average annual increase for New Jersey wages -- 1.4% in 2013.

Awarding the Union’s final wage offer will exacerbate wage
compression by raising the detective’s scale (without the

Trainees) to a range of $67,303.37 - $110,/86.85. ‘his will put

40
pressure on those in the detective’s immediate chain of command
The Division is already experiencing wage compression
challenges. Awarding the Union's proposal would exacerbate the
wage compression to untenable levels.

Finally, comparing the salaries of Deputy Attorneys General
(“DAGs”) who work in the Department shows that the Union’s
proposal would put detectives’ salaries above DAG 4s who require
much higher education levels. Detectives will earn $67,303.37
at step one whereas DAG 4s will earn $62,090.59 at step one
DAG 4s direct and guide detectives in their investigations
Such a result is irrational and unwarranted.

The Union's proposals are unnecessary to stabilize
employment in the Division. N.J.S.A. 34:13A-16g(8) requires
consideration of the parties’ proposals in relation to the
continuity and stability of employment. See, Fox v. Morris Cty.

Policemen’s Assoc, PBA No, 151, 266 N.J. Super. 501 (App. Div.

 

1993) (Court held criterion requires review of employer’s salary
structure, unemployment rate, employee turnover and the absence
of unemployment among police). The record establishes that the
Division has had no difficulty in attracting qualified
candidates. In terms of the Division’s ability to retain
candidates, the record contains no evidence that attrition or
turnover is a concern. Therefore, under the stability in

employment analysis, the Union’s proposals are not warranted.

41
 

In determining salary incr ments for the period of

   

this award, I have considered the following:

AND LEVY CAPS/FINANCIAL IMPACT (G5, 6)

 

Budget

According to the Governor’s FY2015 Budget Summary (FOP-36),
the following summarizes the financial state of New Jersey as of
February 2014:

- At 7.3%, New Jersey’s unemployment rate is now the lowest
it’s been in five years, since December 2008;

- New Jersey’s economic expansion continued in 2013. A
total of 10,100 jobs were created in the last 12 months,
and a total of 121,900 private sector jobs were created
since 2010;

- State income has continued to set new highs in virtually
every quarter;

- The outlook for 2014 and 2015 is positive;

- Indexes of monthly economic activity compiled by the
Federal Reserve of Philadelphia suggest that New Jersey's
growth has been at or above the national pace and higher
than other states in the region. The Fed also suggested
that New Jersey could be one of the fastest growing states
in the nation;

- Based on estimates from the New Jersey Department of
Treasury, Office of Revenue and Economic Analysis, New
Jersey’s total revenues for Fiscal Year 2015 will be $34.4
billion, $1.9 billion, or 5.8% above the 2014 level;

- The forecast of $9.2 billion in sales tax revenue for
Fiscal Year 2015 will see an increase of $532 million over
the 2014 level;

- The Fiscal Year 2015 gross income tax revenues are

42
expected to be $14 billion, or 8.2%, higher than the
revised Fiscal Year 2014 estimate;

- The Fiscal Year 2015 budget is expected to have $313
million in surplus; and

- There is $1.2 billion budgeted to provide property tax
relief.

The Deputy Director of the State’s Office of Management and

Budget, Robert Peden, testified that the difference between the

$32.6 and $31.5 billion is a $1.1 billion reduction,

that is

attributable to when the State’s April tax collections were

received for the gross income tax; an amount that fell short of

collections. (4T-10) Further, Peden stated that the above

categories of income, sales, and corporate represented the “Big

3” of taxes which the State received. (4T-11)

Peden stated that the chart above shows how the State gets
to its ending fund balance of $300 million; and $31.5 billion
worth of revenues. Peden added that because of the shortfall in
revenues, the State would have to identify a series of “lapses”
in order to balance the budget. (47-11

A lapse is appropriated money which, if not spent, comes
back to the State’s general fund to assist in balancing its
budget. Peden further testified that there are two categories
of lapses on the chart above: the first is a series with
hundreds of different accounts that were examined for
opportunities to lapse $812 million; the second lapse is a
titled a “pension” lapse. Peden stated that sometimes the State
freezes appropriated accounts and sometimes it returns monies

that have been appropriated and place it in the State’s surplus.

45
Together, between the two lapses and its revenues, the State has
an ending fund balance of $300 million, which goes back into
surplus in the general fund. (4T-12-13)

The Union points to the $300 million in surplus as a
potential source to fund salary increases. However, Peden
testified that in his view, the current surplus amount does not
measure up to what is considered adequate levels, which would be
a minimum of 5% of the budget. Such minimum surplus levels
Peden explained, are necessary as a “rainy day fund”. The
State’s failure to maintain adequate surplus has negatively
impacted upon its bond rating

Supplemental funds of $253 million reflected in the above

explained that the $85 million was additional funding which
would be excluded from the total supplemental, for a revised
total of $168 million. (47-14

Pensions, Health Benefits, and Debt Service

 

The State’s FY 2015 Budget represents $32.5 billion in
appropriations and revenues. The two largest categories of the
budget are State Aid and Grants-In-Aid. State Aid accounts for
41.2% of the budget, or $13.4 billion. Grants-In-Aid represent
30.1% of the budget, or $9.8 billion. This aid includes property
tax relief programs, Medicaid, PAAD, nursing home and long-term
services and support, and support for higher education

Executive Operations encompasses all of the salaries of State
employees or 10.5% of the overall budget, or $3.4 billion. The
State’s employee fringe benefits include both benefits for active
employees and post-retirement medical and health benefits
employer taxes, pensions, and so forth and represent about 7% of

the budget, or $2.3 billion. Debt Service, excluding School

47
Construction, accounts for 8.4% of the budget, or $2.7 billion

The two remaining categories of the budget are Legislative
and Judiciary and accounts for 2.4% of the budget, or $.8 billion;
and capital improvements, which accounts for .4% of the budget, or
$.1 billion. (S-5; 47-16-17

Peden testified that pensions, health benefits, and debt
service consume 49.0% of the State’s overall revenue growth since
FY 2009. Pensions, health benefits, and debt service account for
$7.39 billion of the FY 2015 Appropriations Account of $32.6
billion. (8-5; 47-23

According to the New Jersey Pension and Health Benefits Study
Commission, health benefit costs for the State are forecasted to
rise 4.0% by the year 2024. Peden stated that when comparing this
increase to its revenues, these increases take up an ever-
increasing share of the State’s revenues. (S-5, 47-26

In summary, Peden testified that as illustrated in the chart
above, there is a revenue increase from FY 2014 to FY 2015 of $1.1
billion. Of that amount, $300 million is appropriated for post~
retirement medical costs; and $430 million is appropriated for the
State’s debt service. (S-5; 47-26

Division of Criminal Justice (DCJ) Budget:

 

The DCJ’s budget for years 2010 through 2015 is essentially

flat. The change in the number of full-time employees represents

a negative -5.7%, or a reduction of 32 employees, (S-5;4T-37-38)

Of the total $31.5 million budgeted for appropriations in
Ded’s FY 2015 budget, $27.4 million is allocated for salaries.
($-5; 47-38-39) The FOP notes that of the FY 2014 DCJ budget, the
salary expenses for the members of this bargaining unit account
for .03% ($10.4 million/$32,920.9 billion) of the total 2014 state
budget. (FOP-18) Peden testified that the FY 2015 budget already
includes funding for the increments paid or to be paid during the

fiscal year.

49
The record reveals that many of the positions in DCJ are
funded by reimbursements from federal agencies and through the
insurance industry.
Bond Rating

As a result, at least in part due to the small fund
balance, Standard and Poor downgraded the State’s credit rating
to A which is tied with California in next to last position
nationally. At the very least, the S & P downgrading will
increase the cost of the State’s already high debt service. (4T-
42)
State Unemployment

The State’s August 2014 unemployment rate compared to four

neighboring states is as follows:® The United States average is

6.1%. (8-5)
- New Jersey: 6.6%
- Delaware: 6.58
- Maryland: 6.48
- New York: 6.4%

Pennsylvania: 5.8%

New Jersey is ranked 33" out of the 50 states and is tied
with Connecticut and West Virginia at 6.6%. (S-5)
Consumer Price Index (CPI)

Dr. Christopher Young is the FOP’s Financial Consultant and

expert witness. He conducted his analysis using two components

 

Source: Bureau of Labor Statistics (September 2014)

50
of the CPI: (1) all items; and (2) medical care. These two
components were analyzed in the following two regions: New York-
Northern New Jersey-Long Island, NY-NJ-CT-PA (“Northern NJ”);
and Philadelphia-Wilmington-Atlantic City, PA-NJ-DE-MD
("Southern NJ). A summary of this data is provided in the chart

below:

 

Yearly Compound Increase (2004-2013

 

Component _| Northern NJ | Southern NJ | Average
All items 2.64% 2.47% 2.56%

Medical Care 3.27% 2.98% 3.13%

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

The Union states that based upon the above information
inflation in the combined regions during the past ten years has
averaged a 2.563 annual increase, with the cost of medical care
increasing at an even greater rate.

The FOP contends that the data cited by Young illustrates
consumer prices in the Northern and Southern Nd regions, as well
as throughout the United States, have increased over the last
several years and will continue to do so in the future. It
states that the percentage increase of the CPI should set a
minimum level of wage increases for an individual to maintain
his or her standard of living. The FOP points out that members
of this bargaining unit have not had salary increases since
2008, notwithstanding the rise in inflation that occurred since
that time.

Young then compared the rate of increase in the CPI with

51
the rate of wage increases experienced by FOP members for the

past several years.

The State argues that the Union’s analysis of the yearly wage
increases of the negotiations unit as compared to the increases
in cost of living did not factor in employee increases as a

result of step movement on the salary guide.

 

The Employer contents that its exhibit S-30 tracks a
detective’s salary history from inception forward. For example
the listed employee became a law enforcement detective July
2000 at a salary of $35,710.20 which increased to the current
rate of $81,787.47; an increase of 129% over a 14-year period

for an average of 9.9% per year. The increase in salary far

out-paces the CPI for the time period analyzed by Young. The

 

increases for the employee since 2004 were as follows: (S~-30)

COMPARABILITY (G3)
The Union argues that the closest comparable group of

employees which should be compared to the DCJ detectives, is the

 

7 «ar/AD represents an across-the-board increase plus an anniversary date

increment. AT represents an anniversary date increment alone. AD/AT/AT
represents a year in which the employee received an anniversary date
increment and two (2) across-the-board increases. (S-30,p.150-56)

53
State Division of State Police, which is also in the Department
of Public Safety. It notes that its members often work side-by-
side with State troopers and both groups have similar
responsibilities. In addition, the Union maintains that a fair
comparison could be drawn between its members and detectives
employed by the various county prosecutors’ offices.

The State asserts the fairest group for comparison to the
DCJ detectives would be the other six law enforcement groups
employed in state government. Additionally, the State points to
the recent contract signed with the IBEW representing the Deputy
Attorneys General who are also within the Department of Law and
Public Safety.

On September 21, 2011, the State signed a successor
agreement with New Jersey State Fraternal Association (“STFA”
which represents the State troopers. This contract covered the
period July 1, 2008 through June 30, 2012, and provided for
across-the-board increases of 2.75% in FY 2009, 2.50% in FY
2010, 2.25% in FY 2011, and no increase in FY 2012. The salary
guide included in the STFA contract shows the following current
salaries for troopers

- Trooper $81,022
= Trooper II $90,949
- Trooper I $95,198

In January 2014, Interest Arbitrator Mastriani issued an

award covering the period July 1, 2011 through June 30, 2015,

54
for the New Jersey Law Enforcement Supervisors Association
(LESA). He awarded no across-the-board increases for FY 2012 or
FY 2013. For FY 2014, he awarded a 1.25% increase to the top
step only; and an additional 1.25% to the top step only for FY
2015. Increments were continued for employees moving through

the step guide. However, those employees received no cost-of-

 

living increase.

On January 27, 2014, the State signed a contract with the
PBA/SLEU covering the period July 1, 2011 through June 30, 2015.
SLEU represents various law enforcement titles such as,
conservation officer, college campus police officers, park
police officers, and weights and measures inspectors. This
contract also provided for no across-the-board increases for FY
2012 and FY 2013. For FY 2014, the parties negotiated for 1.25%
increase to the top step only. For FY 2015, the parties agreed
to 1.25% increase to the top step; and a 1.0% increase to all
other steps in the guide. Increments will continue for the life
of the contract.

In August 2014, the State signed a contract with New Jersey
Law Enforcement Commanding Officers Association, which
represents corrections captains (Juvenile Justice), corrections
majors, as well as supervising conservation officers and
supervising parole officers. This agreement covered the period

July 1, 2011 through June 30, 2015, and provided for a 1.0%

 

® It should be noted that the 2% cap applied to this matter.

55
increase effective July 1, 2013 and a one-time lump sum cash
bonus of $1,750 to corrections majors and $1,160 to all other
unit employees. Effective July 1, 2014, salaries were increased
by 1.25%. Also, in July 1, 2014, corrections majors received a
one-time lump sum cash bonus of $1,500 and all other unit
employees reached a one-time cash bonus of $1,450.

on February 12, 2014, the State signed a contract with IBEW
Local 33 representing the newly certified unit of Deputy Attorneys
General, covering the period July 1, 2013 through the period June
30, 2015. In that contract, the parties agreed to a range
adjustment for unit employees (Z30 to 233 or 235 depending upon
current salary levels and from 233 to 238), subject to approval by
the New Jersey Civil Service Commission. Additionally, the
parties agreed to change employee’s anniversary dates for those
currently employed to July 1, 2013. Further, the parties agreed
to a 1.0% across-the-board increase for FY 2014 and 1.75% increase
for FY 2015. Normal increments are to be paid for the life of the
agreement. It should be noted that this bargaining unit was
certified in October 2010. This is the first contract covering
this unit and DAG’s did not receive any salary increases for FY
2011, FY 2012, and FY 2013.

On October 4, 2013, the State signed a successor agreement
with New Jersey Superior Officers Law Enforcement Association
affiliated with FOP Lodge 193. This bargaining unit consists of

corrections lieutenants, campus police lieutenants, parole

56
supervisors, State park lieutenants, and other supervising law
enforcement officers. This successor agreement covers the
period July 1, 2011 through June 30, 2015. In that contract,
the parties agreed to a wage freeze for FY 2012 and FY 2013; a
1.258 increase for FY 2014, and a 1.25% increase for FY 2015.
In addition, certain titles were granted a one-time lump sum
bonus of $500. Increments continued for all eligible employees

On June 11, 2012, the State signed a successor agreement
with PBA Local 105, representing the State’s corrections
officers, parole officers, and juvenile justice commission
officers. This contract covered the period July 1, 2011 through
June 30, 2015. The parties negotiated no across-the-board
increases for FY 2012 but instead provided for a one-time lump
sum payment of $800 to employees at top step. For FY 2014
employees at top step received an across-the-board increase of
1.75%; for FY 2015, a 1.0% across-the-board increase for
employees in steps 1 through 9; and a 1.5% increase for
employees at on step. Increments continued for the duration of
the contract.

On September 13, 2013, the State signed a successor
agreement with the Investigators Association, affiliated with
FOP Lodge 174, covering the unit of investigators, senior
investigators, and principal investigators, parole and secured
facilities. This contract covers the period July 1, 2011

through June 30, 2015. For FY 2014, the parties agreed to a

57
1.0% across-the-board increase to the top step of the salary
guide. For FY 2015, the parties agreed to a 1.5% increase to
the Lop slep (except for principal investigators who received a
75% to the top step of that guide). In addition, principal
investigators also received an $800 one-time lump sum payment

In June 2012, the State signed an agreement with CWA
covering four bargaining units of white-collar, professional and
supervisory employees in a broad-based unit of civilian state
workers. This agreement covered the period July 1, 2011 through
June 30, 2015. For FY 2012 and FY 2013, the parties agreed to a
wage freeze. For 2014, employees received a 1.0% across-the-
board increase. For FY 2015, employees received a 1.75% across-
the-board increase.

The FOP submitted FOP-18 which included a comparison of DCJ
salaries and other terms and conditions of employment with
detectives in all 21 of the County Prosecutor's Offices. In
comparing the average salary of a DCJ detective to the average
salaries of county prosecutor detectives, the chart below shows

FOP-18, exhibit 2, also reveals that in 2008, DCJ detectives
were above the average pay among county detective units by
$462.00. However, it is an inevitable consequence of these
employees not having received increases since 2008 that has led

to its decline among average pay rates

Private Sector Wage Survey:

I give almost no weight to the component of comparability
with the private sector, other than to observe the private
sector wage increases.

There is no particular occupation, public or private
that is an equitable comparison to detectives. The
investigators are unique in a variety of ways, including
the potential to be called upon to respond to their assigned

mission areas, conducting surveillances, searches, and seizures

59
relative to investigations and related duties as assigned, along
with the stress and dangers of the job. Moreover, they are
regularly required to work evenings, nights and holidays.
Unlike the private sector, they do not compete in a global
economy, which tends to depress wages.

PERC annually distributes a private sector wage survey for use
in interest arbitration proceedings. This wage survey is developed
by the New Jersey Department of Labor and Workforce Development, with
the most recent version of this wage survey being distributed on
September 2014.

The total net change in private sector annual wages for the
State of New Jersey was a 1.6% increase from 2012 to 2013.° That
same figure for the change from 2011 to 2012 was a 2.1% increase
The same wage survey data also provides general comparisons in the
public sector as well. Between 2012 and 2013, the average annual
wage for all state, county, and municipal government workers
increased by 0.4%. During the same period, average wages for state
government workers decreased by 0.63. Total wage increases between
2012 and 2013 for all employees, public and private, amounted to
1.4%.

increase for awards issued in 2013 on post-2011 filings was
1.16% where no 2% cap applied, and 1.89% were the cap did
apply. Over the same time period, reported voluntary settlements
averaged 1.96%.

The PERC analysis indicates that the average 2012 award for
post-2011 with a 2% cap was 1.98%, and an average of 1.59% for
awards with no 2% cap. Settlement for the same time period (based
upon 29 contracts settled) averaged 1.82%. Overall, PERC’s data
over the past few years shows that there is a downward trend in
salary increases received through voluntary settlement or an
award.

CONTINUITY AND STABILITY OF EMPLOYMENT (G7):

 

Employee turnover in this unit has not been significant.
Of the 140 employees employed during FY 2014, only four
detectives left the division. In addition, during FY 2014, the
Employer hired six new detective-trainees. I conclude
therefore, that even with the long term freeze which has been
in effect on employee's salaries, this has not resulted in any
significant negative impact on employee continuity and
stability of employment.

ANALYSIS

Increments

Although not needed to calculate a 2% award under the hard
cap, the total amount the State paid to this bargaining unit in

the 12 months before the contract commences is important

61
because I am required to show the cost of the award. Here,
that period is July 1, 2013 to June 30, 2014.1° The State's
list shows that during that 12-month period, unit employees
were paid an aggregate of $9,913,644. The Union accepted this
amount as the total base year costs.

The cost of increments here is not insignificant. Here,
the State calculated the cost of increments for each year of
the contract, including the costs of moving detective trainees
from the trainee rate on salary scale ¥95 to detective II rate
on salary scale ¥24 (from $51,239 to $53,622), which occurs at
the conclusion of the trainee’s first year of employment. The
FOP did not submit its own calculation of increment costs. The
State calculations show the following increment costs for the

life of the contract: (S-12)

 

Fiscal yr. Total Increments Percent
FY 2015 $582,800.95 5.88%
FY 2016 $195,117.95 1.97%
FY 2017 $168,725.53 1.708
FY 2018 $130,541.57 1.328
FY 2019 $122,856.30 1.24%
Total Increment Cost: $1,200,042.30 12.108

However, it appears that the State has miscalculated the

cost of increments in the first year. It arrived at this

 

*° The State is on a bi-weekly payroll system. The State's list of employees
and the amounts of base salary they were paid was taken from the payroll
period 14 of 2013 to payroll period 13 of 2014, and is therefore, a close
approximation of the total amounts paid. The FOP did not object to this
method, and I have accepted it for the purpose of calculating base year
costs.

62
amount by subtracting the total amount spent for base salaries
in FY 2014 from the total amount to be spent in FY 2015 after
increments are paid. However, the difference belween these two
numbers includes (in addition to increment costs) the amount
needed to bring employees who were paid for part of the year in
FY 2014 to full salary in the subsequent year. This is not a
true “increment cost”. In Borough of New Milford, P.E.R.C. No.
2012-53, 38 NJPER 340 (4116 2012), the Commission provided
instructions for costing out the award to include increment
costs. It stated that the best method to cost out would be to
take the complement of employees on the employer’s payroll on
the last day before the new contract, and move them forward
though the steps (where increments are being awarded) and any
across-the-board increases. Thus, the appropriate starting
point to track costs for contract year one is the total base
salaries of unit employees on the last day before the new
contract begins’

Further, the cost of step movement for detective II’s who
are not yet at the top step is $2,500 per employee; the cost
for detective I’s who are not yet at the top step is $2,897 per
employee. An increment cost of $582,800 for these 136
employees would mean that, even if every unit employee received
a step increment (which they do not), their increments would be

$4,483 (which it is not). Therefore, the State’s calculations

4 This date would ordinarily be the last day of the expired contract.

63
of increment costs for FY 2015 must be rejected. Rather, I
have performed my own calculations of increment costs for FY
2014 based upon the data the State supplied as Lo salary and
anniversary date. I have found that the true cost of
increments for FY 2015 is $108,308.86. Except for the increment
costs for FY 2015, I accept the State’s calculations

SALARY INCREASES AND INCREMENTS

 

The FOP’s stated goal in constructing its salary proposals
was to bring these unit employees up to par with the salaries of
prosecutor’s detectives in the various counties and with
detectives in the State Police. The FOP calculated that its
median salary of all DCJ detectives is $85,849 as compared with
those of county detectives of $95,512. The FOP calculated that
to overcome this $9,663 disparity, it would need a 12% increase

However, the FOP’s proposal for a 12% salary increase
effective on the first day of the 2014-2019 contract is
unrealistic, even if it were followed by no across-the-board
increases for the remainder of the contract period. This
“front-end loading” of the contract would dramatically increase
the Employer’s costs for every year of the contract. It also
fails to recognize that the State is facing difficult times with
regard to revenues.

Further, the Union also seeks range adjustments which have
significant costs in the long run. It asks that Detectives II’s

be given a three-range adjustment -- moved from salary range Y24

64
be given a three-range adjustment -- moved from salary range ¥24
to Y27 -- and that Detective I’s be given an adjustment of five

ranges

 

from ¥27 to ¥32. These proposed range changes would
prove to be expensive to award in the short run and cost
prohibitive in the long run as Detective I’s would move from top
pay of $87,581 to $110,787. In addition, the FOP seeks an
automatic advancement system to move Detective II’s to the
Detective I salary range after five years of service. While the
cost of this proposal is minimal, it still must be considered in
the overall cost of the awarded salary package.

On the other hand, the State’s proposal of a freeze on the
salary guide for the first four years of the contract followed
by a 18 increase in the fifth year is also unreasonable. This
is so particularly in light of the fact that these employees
have endured a guide freeze since 2008. Awarding this proposal
will effectively create a ten-year freeze on the salary guide
(FY 2009 through FY 2018). While employees moving through the
guide would be paid their increments, detectives at top pay
(currently 43) would receive no increase for a number of years.

Additionally, this proposal does not address the cost of
living or the fact that detectives in county prosecutor’s
offices have gotten increases during this period and would
continue to do so (see State’s brief, Appendix A). Further,
the State’s miniscule offer, if awarded, would negatively

impact employees morale and likely lead detectives to seek

65
employment elsewhere, thus, negatively impacting unit
continuity and employment stability. This is all not
supportive of the statutory criteria.

For all of the foregoing reasons, I find that neither
proposal as written is in the public interest. Having
considered all of the relevant facts as discussed above and
the parties’ arguments, as well as the other components of this
award, I award the following salary increases:

FY 2015: Effective 10/1/14: 1.75% ATB

FY 2016: Effective 7/1/15: 1.5% ATB

FY 2017: Effective 7/1/16: 1.53 ATB

FY 2018: Effective 7/1/17: 1.5% ATB

FY 2019: Effective 7/1/18: 1.5% ATB
Step increments will be continue to be paid pursuant to the
previously established increment plan for these employees.

The increases awarded above result in a compounded
increase over the life of the five-year agreement of 7.998.
The impact on top pay is that it will increase the Detective
I’s salary from $87,581 to $94,580 by the last year of the
agreement. This will put DCJ detectives closer to the average
salary of detectives employed by county prosecutors of $95,512.
While it certainly could be argued that over the next four
years the county averages will also increase, such increases
are likely to be slight since the 2% cap (including step

increases) will have the effect of keeping salary increases

66
low. Additionally, top pay for Detective I’s will closely
comparable to the salary afforded to State Trooper I’s at a top
pay of $95,281. Also, this increase, even by conlracl end,
will maintain a reasonable disparity between top pay of
detective and the salary of detective sergeants which is
currently $105,810.

The pay increases awarded herein in the first year grant
some recognition to the fact that DCJ detectives have not had a
salary increase since 2008. In addition, this increase of
1.75% in the first year is comparable to that afforded to the
Deputy Attorneys General for F¥ 2015, who also suffered from a
wage freeze for several years. Further, the increase awarded
to this unit is comparable to the increase provided to the CWA
unit -- the largest unit of State employees.

While the State argues that I am bound to follow the
internal pattern of settlement, here there is no consistent
pattern of settlement for FY 2015. Some unit settled for a
1.25% increase while others received more. Moreover, even if a
consistent pattern of settlement existed for FY 2015, I believe
that the fact that DCJ detectives endured a five-year salary
freeze is sufficient justification for awarding increases on
the high end.

In awarding 1.5% increases across-the-board for the
remaining years of the contract, I have considered the DCJ

employees who, five years ago, were at about average among

67
detectives Statewide, have now fallen significantly below that
average. On the other hand, given the severe financial
constraints on the State, and particularly on the DCU budget,
the lost ground cannot be made up completely during this
contract cycle. Moreover, it must be remembered that the
raises awarded herein, are in addition to step increments which
of course add to the total cost of the award

Further, the 1.5% increase to the salary guide for the
four fiscal years going forward, closely parallel the cost of
living. It will allow the Division to offer its detectives a
competitive salary that will permit turnover to remain low as
detectives will not need to shop in other jurisdictions for
better pay opportunities. This is consistent with the
statutory criteria of continuity and stability of employment
Moreover, this award will increase employee morale which is in
the public interest.

Given that I have determined that the 2% arbitration cap
does not apply to this matter, this award is in the lawful
authority of the Employer. In addition, because I have limited
the retroactivity of this award to October 1, 2014, this will
diminish the financial impact on the DCJ budget and the
taxpayers of the State, which is in the public interest
Advancement To Detective I

The FOP proposes a contract provision that would

automatically advance employees in the Detective I title to the

68
Detective II title after five years. The Union notes that,
until 2013, the Division had a “advancement track” for
detectives. Delecltives were hired as detective-trainees and
then automatically moved to the detective II title after one
year. After serving in the detective II title for four years
the employee was automatically advanced to the title of
detective I. The Union seeks to reinstate this practice and
include it within the contract provisions. The Union observes
that this is similar to the provisions of the STFA contract
wherein State troopers automatically advanced from trooper to
trooper II to trooper I based upon the attainment of years of
service.

Both Detectives Marfino and Pentony testified regarding how
detectives had historically “progressed” through the detective
titles and the appropriate salary ranges. (17-45-46; 31-27
They testified that detectives were recently advised by the
Division that Civil Service was now calling such advancement a
“promotion” and employees would no longer advance automatically

The Union contends that what the State has now labeled a
“promotion” to detective I is not really a promotion at all but
is merely an advancement from one range to another. More
specifically, the FOP contends that such advancement includes
none of the indicia of a process one would normally associate
with a promotional process. First, the FOP notes that the job

descriptions for the two titles virtually identical except for

69
the length of service associated with each. It notes that the
job description for detective I does not confer any supervisory
duties to the tille. As a practical matter, the Union states
that in fact, the only difference between the responsibilities
of a detective II and a detective I is a function of the greater
experience level a detective I possesses

Further, the Union maintains that since the Division’s
announcement that the elevation from detective II to detective I
would now be considered a promotion, no “promotions” have
actually taken place. In addition, the record shows that there
is no process in place for employees to be promoted.

Promotional criteria has not been established; promotional
announcements have not occurred; and no interviews or screening
process has been developed. Chief of Staff Miller testified
that she was unaware of any promotional process which has been
developed for detective II’s to advance to detective I's.

The State argues that the Union’s proposal to automatically
advance detective II’s to detective I’s amounts to a promotion
and is therefore not mandatorily negotiable.

As Director of the Governor’s Office of Employee
Relations, Michael Dee testified on both direct and cross
examination, (5T-4,7, 10). The move from detective II to
detective I advances the individual to a title with a higher
Class Code; i.e., a promotion as defined by the Civil Service

Commission (“CSC”) in its regulations. Specifically, the CSC

70
defines promotion of an individual employed in the State service
as “an advancement to a title having a higher class code * than
the former permanent title.” N.J.A.C. 4A:1-1.3 (emphasis
added). The CSC defines Class Code as the “designation assigned
to job titles in State and local service with ranking based upon
an evaluation of job content.”

Exhibit $-21 establishes that the detective II title has a
class code of 23 while the detective I title has a class code of
26. ‘Thus, the State argues that when a unit member moves from
detective II to detective I he/she advances-i.e., is promoted --
to a title with a higher class code. As such, the move from
detective II to detective I is a promotion and, therefore, the
Union’s proposal for an automatic promotion is non-negotiable.

Accordingly, the State avers that I am required to follow
the well-established precedent and find the contested proposals
non-negotiable as they would impermissibly infringe upon the
State's ability to promote detectives and to establish
promotional criteria.

I find that the Division has historically treated career
advancements for non-ranking detectives as advancements, and not
promotions, and continues to do so.

The Division has a standard operating procedure for career

advancement for detectives (SOP-45). That SOP provides,

 

% The NJ CSC’s Class Code is not the same as the Salary Range. (S-21)

45:1: POLICY OF DIVISION OF CRIMINAL JSUTICE

 

The Division of Criminal Justice recognizes that a

definite, well designed career path is essential for

providing the individual State Investigator with a

mechanism for future personal planning and for

fostering good morale and overall well-being of the
investigative staff. Therefore, it is the policy of
the Division of Criminal Justice that a State

Investigator shall progress through the investigative

ranges in a steady and orderly fashion.

The SOP continues in Section 45-5 to lay out how and when
an employee would advance from trainee through the career path
for investigators; advancement is based upon length of service
and satisfactory performance. By contrast, the SOP makes clear
that advancement to a supervisory position is considered a
promotion to be based upon competitive interviews (Section 45-
6).

The Division continues to advance detectives from the
trainee title to detective II based upon the completion of one
year of service and satisfactory performance. The State's
argument that it now views advancement to detective I as a
“promotion” is undermined by both the SOP and the lack of any
action on the Division’s part to actually implement any
promotional process or establish criteria for such promotional
opportunities, Based upon the record, I find that in these
particular circumstances, this salary advancement is merely a

range change and not a promotion. Accordingly, such advancement

is mandatorily negotiable. I am inclined to award the Union's

72
proposal that the Division resume its practice of automatically

moving employees from the detective II range to the detective I

range based upon length of service and satisfactory performance.
The following chart illustrates the detectives’ career

advancement through the salary ranges:

SALARY RANGE CHANGES

The FOP seeks to change the salary ranges of unit employees
by advancing detective II’s three ranges and advancing Detective
I's five ranges. It also asked to move detective trainees from
the Y95 range to the Y24 salary range.

Currently, the DCJ detective trainees are compensated
according to range Y95, which provides a minimum salary of
$48,970.62 and, after six months of service, a salary of

$51,239.81. Detective II’s are compensated in accordance with

 

salary range Y24, which is as follow:

 

Increment | $2,500.22 |
Step 1 $53,622.79

The State argues that the Division is currently
experiencing wage compression challenges. Awarding the Union's
proposal would exacerbate the wage compression to untenable
levels. It notes that sergeants are presently being paid in
salary range 30 (at a top pay of $105,810) and lieutenants are
presently being paid in salary range 33 (at a top pay of
$116,129). The deputy chief of detectives has a salary of
$109,200. Therefore, awarding the Union’s proposed range
changes with a top pay for detective I at $110,787 would put

75
those employees above the pay rate for sergeants and would
create compression with higher ranks.

I agree with the State’s position that granting Lhe
proposed range changes would compound the compression problem
which already exists, which in turn would negatively impact
employee morale to those above and make it unlikely detectives
would ever seek promotions. Further, I do not believe that I
have the authority to award range changes with any finality as
it is the Department of Civil Service which controls the setting
and adjustments to salary ranges. See the State’s contract with
IBEW providing for range changes for deputy attorneys general

subject to the approval of the Department of Civil Service.

 

Moreover, the FOP has not adequately explained its rationale or
justification for the range changes. This proposal is denied.
CHANGES IN ANNIVERSARY DATES

Finally, the FOP proposes to change the date on which step
increases are awarded. Currently employees receive step
increases on the payroll period of their anniversary
Employees on steps 1 through 8 move through the guide annually
employees move from step 8 to step 9 after 18 months; and
employees move to step 10 after 24 months. The Union proposes
that all unit employees annually advance on the guide on
January 1. The Union has not adequately explained the

rationale for this proposal except to argue that it would

16
simplify calculations. I find that this proposal has not been

justified and I decline to award it.

WORK HOURS

The Union proposes the following clause:

A. Regular Hours/Workweek

The regularly scheduled workday shall consist of no
less than eight (8) hours. The regular hours of work
each day shall be consecutive. The regularly scheduled
work week shall consist of five (5) days, Monday to
Friday. References to consecutive hours of work in
the balance of this Article shall be construed to
include a one-half (1/2) hour paid meal period in
which employees may be subject to

recall.

The State proposes this language for the work hour’s

clause:

Work Day and Work Week

A.

The work week for each job classification within

the unit shall be consistent with its designation in
the State Compensation Plan and shall generally
consist of eight (8) consecutive hours per day, five

(5)

days per week. However, the general work week and

work hours may be changed to meet operational needs

The FOP argues it seeks to codify the regular hours of work

for detectives as defined by Standard Operating Procedure #46.

(FOR-32)

Given that this is the policy the Division of Criminal

Justice has abided by for approximately 20 years, FOP’s proposal

should be awarded. Moreover, the proposal does not infringe on

the State’s managerial prerogatives in any way. By qualifying

the proposal with the word “regular” and not delineating the

exact hours required for all Detectives, FOP’s proposal

77
recognizes that all detectives will not all work the same hours
and/or days given the varying nature of their assignments.

The State makes no particular argument in its brief
concerning the above disputed language

The Division’s SOP #46 provides in part:

46-6. Normal Hours

A State Investigator shall be assigned a shift of

normal or regular hours which shall be 8:30 a.m. to

5:00 p.m. Monday through Friday; or 9:00 a.m. through

5:30 p.m. Monday through Friday; or such other expanse

of time an identification of days as may be assigned

by the appropriate [supervisor] .

To the extent that the FOP’s proposal tracks the language of the
existing SOP, I am inclined to award it. The SOP was
promulgated by the Employer and, although the policy was drafted
in 1995 -- prior to the State’s changing the detective’s title
from “investigator” to “detective-Law and Public Safety”, the
policy has never been modified and is presumptively still in
effect.

However, the FOP apparently seeks to deviate from the SOP
as to the 30-minute meal break. The SOP provides for a thirty-
minute unpaid meal break during an employee's eight and a half
hour shift. By its proposal to include a thirty-minute paid
meal break into an eight-hour work shift, the FOP appears to be
seeking to reduce the length of the work day by one half-hour

per day. Alternatively, if the FOP is seeking to maintain the

present schedule of 8:30 a.m. to 5:00 p.m., with a thirty-minute

18
lunch break, then the consequence of its proposal would be to
add thirty minutes of overtime per day. The State has not
responded Lo this demand. Nevertheless, I find no justification
in the record evidence to support such a reduction in the work
day. I am inclined to leave the length of the work day,
including the current thirty-minute unpaid meal break (pursuant
to the SOP), intact.

I award the following:

Detectives shall be assigned a shift of regular hours
which shall be 8.5 consecutive work hours, 5 days per
week. Unless the nature of a duty assignment
dictates, otherwise, a State investigator shall take
one thirty-minute unpaid meal period during his/her
8.5 hour shift.

A detective may be scheduled to work at times outside
of his/her regular hours, or in addition to, his/her
regular hours. Employees will be given as much
advance notice as practicable of changes in their
scheduled hours of work.

OVERTIME
B. Overtime

All overtime shall be compensated as paid compensation
at the rate of one and one-half (1 %) hours, unless
the employee, at said employee's sole discretion,
elects to bank those hours in the Compensatory Time
Off bank (hereinafter “C.T.O. Bank”).

All work performed in excess of forty (40) hours in a
five (5) consecutive day work week shall be
compensated at the overtime rate. For overtime
calculation purposes, time worked includes vacation
leave, compensatory time leave, sick leave
bereavement leave, administrative leave, union leave
and holiday leave.

D. Overtime

79
Employees are compensated pursuant to a 28-day cycle
in accordance with N.J.A.C. 4A:6-2.2A (b). Hours

worked up to and including 160 hours in a 28-day cycle

are paid at straight time. Hours worked between 160

hours and 171 hours in a 28-day cycle shall be

compensated with compensatory time off (CTO) at the

rate of one (1) CTO hour for every one (1) hour

worked. Hours worked over 171 hours in a 28-day cycle

shall be compensated at the overtime rate of one and

one-half (1%) times the employee's regular hourly

rate.

Overtime for detectives is presently calculated based upon
a 28-day work cycle. Hours worked over 160 during the period
are compensable by compensatory time off calculated at an hour
for hour rate; hours over 171 in the period are compensable at a
time-and-one-half rate.

According to Neggia, FOP 91 members have to work over 171
hours in a 28-day cycle before they are entitled to any paid
overtime. For those hours worked between 160 hours and 171
hours, FOP members accrue compensatory time, wherein in which
hours are stored in an employee time bank. Significantly, this
time accrues as straight time. Hours worked over 171 are stored
in a separate bank at one and one-half (1%) times the number of
hours worked (time and a half) until that employee’s bank
reaches eighty (80) hours. It is only after that bank reaches
eighty (80) hours, that any hours worked over one hundred
seventy one (171) in a twenty-eight (28) day cycle are then paid
at the overtime rate of time and a half. (3T114-115)

The Union argues that this system allows the Division of

Criminal Justice to manipulate the same and employ certain

80
measures to avoid paying overtime to detectives. As described by
Detective Neggia, given the fact the Division of Criminal
Justice has a 28-day cycle to work with, Lhey manipulate the
same by mandating Detectives to “flex” their time and take
certain days off towards the end of the cycle to avoid paying
overtime. (3T116:7-117:12) The Union also notes that the
Division also does not charge detectives for use of vacation
and/or administrative leave days already utilized in an earlier
portion of a twenty-eight (28) day cycle

The Union contends that the overtime and/or compensatory
time off policies utilized by the Division of Criminal Justice
are confusing and inequitable to say the least. Of critical
importance, however, is the fact that detectives do not receive
“overtime” compensation for the hours worked beyond 160 up to
and including 171. Instead, compensation for these hours is
provided to detectives in the form of compensatory time off and
paid at straight time.

The FOP contends that its proposal seeks an overtime and
compensatory time off system that is similar and/or identical in
nature to almost every other law enforcement agency in the
State.

The Union maintains that, should the Arbitrator accept
FOP’s proposal concerning overtime and compensatory time, the
negotiations unit's members would earn overtime compensation for

all work performed in excess forty hours in a five consecutive

81
day work week. The Union avers that its proposed system is
simple, straightforward, and, most importantly, fair

The State argues DCJ Invesligalors, now DCJ Detectives,
have been working the same 28-day work schedule since July 8,
1995. (FOP-32) Here, the Union seeks a five-day, Monday thru
Friday work week with a required eight-consecutive-hour work
day. (J-8) The State notes that DCJ detectives have been
designated by the Civil Service Commission (“CSC”) as “4L,” and
therefore the Union’s proposal is preempted by regulation and is
non-negotiable. N.J.A.C. 4A:6-2.2A provides that:

a. Job titles which meet all of the following criteria
may be assigned an alternate work schedule consisting
of a 23-day cycle, pursuant to 29 U.S.C. § 207(K). .

b. Job titles which meet the criteria in (a) above and
which are assigned such an alternate work schedule
shall be designated 4L. All employees who meet the
criteria are considered engaged in law enforcement
activities regardless of their rank or their status as
trainee, probationary or permanent employees.

1. The tour of duty within the 28 day cycle shall
total at least 160 hours. At the discretion of the
appointing authority, employees who work more than 160
hours may be compensated through either a provision
for flexible work patterns or a grant of comparable
amounts of time off to a maximum of one hour for each
hour of such additional work time

2. Within the 28-day cycle, employees can work a
maximum of 171 hours. Employees may work more than 40
hours in a week without incurring overtime, so long as
they do not work more than 171 hours within the 28 day
cycle. Overtime begins on the 172nd hour

3. Except for the special eligibility requirements set
forth above, overtime compensation shall be paid in
the same manner as employees in 40 hour workweek
titles. See N.J.A.C. 4A:3-5.5(b)

82
The State argues that the FOP has failed to present any
evidence Lo support a compelling reason for abandonment of the
long-established 41 work schedule.

The State argues that the Union’s proposal would represent
a complete change in the manner in which overtime is calculated
resulting in an incalculable (and, ultimately, costly) impact on
the manner in which the Division performs its work. The State
asserts that the Union has failed to justify its offer to change
a long-standing work schedule.

As to the need to retain the 28-day schedule, the State
relies on the testimony of Chief of Detectives Paul Morris
According to Morris, although units such as those that
investigate insurance fraud, conduct financial investigations
and assist with the prosecution of court cases tend to have more
consistent Monday to Friday, 8:30 a.m. to 5:00 p.m. or 9:00 a.m.
to 5:30 p.m. schedules, (57-128), many other assignments require
that detectives work at other times when the crime is occurring
Morris provided the following examples

* Covering wiretaps requires 24/7 coverage for
between twenty to sixty day periods.

. Activities in the Human Trafficking Unit, which
deals heavily with the crime of forced prostitution,
also must be available 24/7.

* The Gangs and Organized Crime Unit deals with
“the gray market which would include illegal guns

illegal narcotics, money laundering these folks aren't
working nine to five and some of the operatives you're

83
using whether their informants or not the ones who are
in contact with you, all the time they are not working
nine to five. They do things when they want or they
need to.”

* Detectives are occasionally called upon to carry
out raids which “occur when we can use the element of
surprise and that could take place at any time

. A Detective may need to execute an arrest
warrant. That work must be done when the Detective
“can get” the target, which “may not be feasible to do
nine to five. You may have to ask people to come in in
the afternoon to able to capture the individual.”

¢ The installation of surveillance equipment is
generally done at times when the Detective will not be
seen. “[I]f you were going to put a bug in a car it
would necessitate getting up real early in the morning
or in the middle of the night when the owner of the
car is sound asleep. If we are going to do a survey
of electronic surveillance using a camera on a
particular location, we wouldn't want to go out to do
that survey in a casual observe and someone see us out
there. They want to go when it's quite and the cover
of night can help us.

. Detectives assigned to the Shooting Response Team

conduct on-site investigation of “the use of deadly

force employed by police officers in the State.” Such

shooting can occur at any time of the day or night

In Morris’ eight years as Chief, there have been as

few as three shootings to as many as ten shootings per

year.
The State also notes that, Det. Neggia characterized the Union’s
overtime offer as “exactly the same” as that found in the State
Police contract. The State point out unlike DCJ Detectives,
State Police work in shifts and, thus, DCJ’s scheduling needs
differ greatly than those of the State Police (e.g., given that

Troopers work on shifts, there is less need to have employees

work off-shift given the availability of relief troopers). The

84
provisions relating to hours of work contained in the STFA
contract reflect that difference. Depending on assignment
troopers can work eight~, ten- or twelve-hour shifts, as well as
shifts of anywhere between eight and twelve hours.

So # #

I find that, given the nature of the operations performed
by detectives employed at DCJ, flexibility in scheduling is
essential. The FOP’s comparison to other law enforcement units
is inapposite in that groups such as State troopers, State
corrections officers, and others typically work around-the-clock
shifts to staff a police or custodial operation on a 24/7 basis
Therefore, their work schedules are more fixed and regular
Here, the Employer needs flexibility to cover investigations of
crimes as they occur. Its operation does not lend itself to a
strictly 9-to-5 work schedule. The Union has not adequately
provided justification for changing the overtime computation
plan to one based upon a 40-hour work week. Moreover, not even
antidotal evidence has been supplied to demonstrate the possible
costs associated with a complete modification of the overtime
formula. Therefore, I’m unable to track the costs of this
modification for purposes of costing out the award as required
by arbitrators. Accordingly, the State’s proposal is awarded as
follows:

D. Overtime

85
Employees are compensated pursuant to a 28-day cycle
in accordance with N.J.A.C. 4A:6-2.2A (b). Hours
worked up to and including 160 hours in a 28-day cycle
are paid at straight time. Hours worked between 160
hours and 171 hours in a 28-day cycle shall be
compensated with compensatory time off (CTO) at the
rate of one (1) CTO hour for every one (1) hour
worked. Hours worked over 171 hours in a 28-day cycle
shall be compensated at the overtime rate of one and
one-half (1%) times the employee’s regular hourly
rate.

COMP.

TIME

The Union proposes:

C. Compensatory Time Off

1. Compensatory time off (hereinafter “C.T.0.”) will
be recorded in a "bank" up to a maximum of one hundred
and forty (140) hours at a rate of time and a half.
Any overtime earned by an employee with one hundred
and forty (140) hours banked is payable only in cash
or taken as compensatory time only if agreed upon by
the employee. Hours currently in the employee’s “Comp
Time Bank” will be transferred to the new C.T.0. Bank

2. Once C.T.0. is banked in the C.T.0. Bank, the time
accrued shall remain in the C.T.0. Bank and only be
used at the request of the employee. Each request is
subject to prior employer approval based on
operational needs.

D. Current “11 Hour Bank” a.k.a. “Bank 1”

 

Hours currently “banked” by employees in Bank 1 shall
be carried over. After the implementation of this
contract, hours will no longer accrue into Bank 1.
These hours can be used at the discretion of the
employee until separation from the Division of
Criminal Justice. Any unused hours banked in the
current “11 Hour Bank” or “Bank 1” that go unused will
be paid in cash upon retirement

The State proposes:
Employees are compensated pursuant to a 28-day cycle

in accordance with N.J.A.C. 4A:6-2.2A (b). Hours
worked up to and including 160 hours in a 28-day cycle

86
are paid at straight time. Hours worked between 160

hours and 171 hours in a 28-day cycle shall be

compensated with compensatory time off (CTO) at the

rate of one (1) CTO hour for every one (1) hour

worked. Hours worked over 171 hours in a 28-day cycle

shall be compensated at the overtime rate of one and

one-half (1%) times the employee’s regular hourly

rate.

The use of banked CTO hours for time off may be

scheduled by the employee or the Division in

accordance with departmental needs. At the request of

either party, the employee and her/his supervisor

shall meet to amicably schedule CTO. If the employee

and her/his supervisor cannot agree on scheduling, the

supervisor shall have the discretion to schedule the

cTo

FOP argues that its proposal seeks the establishment of one
compensatory time off bank, instead of the two separate banks
currently being utilized by the Division. The “comp bank” would
permit a maximum of 140 hours, to be used at the discretion of
the employee, subject to the operational needs of the Division
Moreover, FOP’s proposal also addresses how the current “11-
Hour Bank,” those hours accrued between 160 and 171, will be
phased out and eliminated. Specifically, it proposes that at
the time this contract is implemented, hours will no longer
accrue into this bank and the hours contained therein can be
utilized by the detective throughout the course of their
employment and/or be paid out upon their retirement
Eventually, all of the hours contained in the “11-Hour Bank”

will be drained and the bank can then be eliminated in its

entirety.

87
The Union argues that the State’s proposal would codify the
convoluted, unfair overtime and compensatory time off systems
currently being utilized

The State makes no particular argument in its brief with
regard to the Union’s proposal to merge the comp time banks
together.

I find neither the FOP’s proposal nor the State’s proposal
to be satisfactory. First, the current SOP provides:

A State investigator working overtime shall earn

compensatory time at the rate of one and one-half

compensatory hours for every hour of overtime. Earned

comp time shall be credited to the State investigator

at the end of the work test period to be available for

use in the following work test period and thereafter

Acceptance of employment with the Division of Criminal

Justice constitutes agreement to accept comp time in

lieu of cash overtime.

A State investigator may accumulate comp time to a

maximum of 480 hours. Earned overtime which would

cause accumulated comp time to exceed 480 hours shall

be paid in cash in accordance with F.L.S.A. The

Division may pay any and all comp time in cash at any

time. Compensatory time balances so paid shall be

reduced in proportion to the cash payment

The SOP does not distinguish the hours between hours in the
11-hour bank and hours in the CTO bank; therefore, it is unclear
whether the 480-hour cap on accumulated compensatory time
applies to only the regular comp time bank or both banks
Moreover, the comp time limitation of 480 hours in the SOP
cannot be reconciled with the unrebutted testimony of the

Union's witnesses that comp time in the CTO bank is currently

capped at 80 hours. Further, the SOP provides that all overtime

88
shall be at time and one-half which is clearly not the existing
practice. Therefore, I am unable to reconcile the existing
practice as explained in the record with the provisions in the
SOP.

I award the following:

There shall be one bank of compensatory time off
("CTO"). Pursuant to the overtime article, employees
who work more than 160 hours and up to and including
171 hours in a 28-day cycle, will be credited with
comp time on an hour-for-hour basis. Employees may
use time accrued in the CTO bank at their discretion,
subject to prior employer approval based on
operational needs.

 

WEEKEND HOURS

Employees required to work weekends shall be paid at the

rate of one and one-half (1 % ) times the normal salary

rate.

The FOP argues this proposal merely delineates that
detectives who are required to work weekends shall be paid at
the rate of one and one-half (1 %) times the normal salary rate
In essence, this proposal seeks a “shift differential” of sorts

According to Neggia, many detectives assigned to certain
task forces and/or narcotics units are assigned a significant
number of weekend and night hours. (3T127-129). Moreover, Neggia
stated that there are various scenarios wherein which a
detective might get “stuck” working overnight and/or on the
weekends. Given that this varies from a typical detective’s

regular hours, the FOP believes these detectives should be

89
compensated at a higher rate for such work beyond the “normal
call of duty.”

The FOP argues that its proposal is more than reasonable
and should be awarded. Quite simply, being required to work on
the weekends is atypical for the DCJ detectives. Those
detectives who are required to do so should be rightfully
compensated for the impact such work has on their personal
lives. Furthermore, many law enforcement units have a similar
contract provision, providing the employees who perform such
work with an “enhanced” form of compensation. FOP should be
afforded the same benefit.

The State argues that there is no provision in the STFA
contract which provides for State police be paid overtime for
weekend work.

Although the FOP perceives that working weekends is outside
of detectives’ “normal workday”, I find that such “off-hours”
assignments are typical for law enforcement officers. In fact,
most employees with police powers work shifts which certainly
include evening shifts, overnight shifts, and weekends. This is
widely considered an integral component of holding a job in law
enforcement. While some municipal police departments and county
corrections groups may still pay a differential for some shifts.
the concept of shift differential is no longer a widely accepted
benefit. Further, I have not seen special compensation or a

differential paid tor weekend work, as such assignments are an

90
expected part of a career in law enforcement. More importantly,
the FOP did not point to any contract with State law enforcement
groups which pays premium pay for weekend work. The FOP’s
proposal is denied.
OVERNIGHT STAY

Both parties have made proposals concerning compensation
and accommodations for overnight stays. The Union proposes

Any employee who is assigned an investigation and/or
extradition which causes him/her to stay out of state
overnight shall receive an additional 4 hours pay (at
the overtime rate) for each night out of state in
addition to pay for actual hours worked. In addition
to the employee receiving lodging and travel expenses
the employee shall receive payment in accordance with
the current Federal and/or State per diem guidelines
for meals.

Any employee traveling for approved training requiring
one or more overnight stays shall be paid for eight
(8) hours pay or the actual hours worked for each day
over eight (8) hours. Actual time traveling both to
and from an approved training shall be

paid. Employees who are stranded or otherwise delayed
while on travel due to circumstances outside of their
control shall be reimbursed for this time. In addition
to the employee receiving lodging and travel expenses
the employee shall receive payment in accordance with
current Federal and/or State per diem guidelines for
meals.

The State proposes:

Any employee who is assigned an investigation or
extradition which causes him/her to stay out of the
state overnight or who travels out of state overnight
to attend mandatory training shall receive per diem
reimbursement for lodging, meals, and expenses
consistent with the State Department of the Treasury
Travel Regulations. The time spent traveling for the
above-referenced purposes shall be compensated as
required by the federal Fair Labor Standards Act.

91
The Union argues that its proposal would solve the current
system of reimbursement and compensation which is dependent upon
the whim of the supervisor. Detective Neggia also testified
regarding the part of the proposal pertaining to training-
related activities

Q. The second paragraph of the overnight stay, it

discusses when an employee becomes stranded out-of-

state whether for official duties or training, things

of that sort. Why is the union asking for that?

A. We are asking for anybody who is away on training,

I believe that involves an overnight stay of one or

more days, that they basically be paid for the actual

hours in excess of eight hours a day and in each day

for eight hours that they are actually there working

or travelling back and forth to the training.

Q. Have there been situations where employees have

been stranded overnight at different training

exercises and unable to get home?

A. Yes.

Q. And how has that been handled in the past?

A. It varies by individual. Certain individuals have

been denied time due to no cause of their own duty

being stranded due to weather conditions. (37131

The FOP argues that its proposal would impose a level of
uniformity and clearly delineate how such a situation should be
handled going forward. Moreover, the proposal would ensure that
detectives are rightfully compensated for such assignments
and/or activities that require them to be away from their
families.

Alternatively, the State’s proposal regarding “overnight

stays” does not spell out how such situations will be handled,

92
but merely states that detectives will be compensated for the
time spent traveling as required by New Jersey wage payment laws
and the federal Fair Labor Standards Act. Such language does
nothing more than continue the inconsistent, haphazard way these
situations are currently handled. For the reasons set forth by
Detective Neggia, this cannot continue. Consequently, the FOP
argues that its proposal is superior and should be awarded

The State points to the Division’s current SOP-46, which
provides:

Travel which keeps a State [Detective] away from home

overnight must be approved by the appropriate

[supervisor] before such travel takes place. Activity

which constitutes work time during travel away from

home shall be determined in accordance with the

regulations promulgated under the Fair Labor Standards

Act. FOP-32, Sec. 46-12
The State points out that neither the concept of an “overnight
stay,” nor compensation for such stays is addressed in any of
the State’s six law enforcement agreements (S-31). Nor are
overnight stays or out-of-state travel addressed in the State

Police CNA (FOP-24). Rather, Neggia testified that he believed

the proposal was found in one of the county contracts.

The State contends that a provision in some unspecified county
contract is not persuasive justification for awarding the
provision. Instead, the Arbitrator should rely on and award the
State’s counter-proposal which is based on the almost two-decade

old sop-4

 

} the State Department of the Treasury Travel

93
Regulation, which applies to all State employees; and the
federal Fair Labor Standards Act, which mandates compensation
for covered travel time and reimbursement for covered travel

expenses. Accordingly, N.J.S.A. 34:13a-16g(9), supports the

 

 

awarding of the State’s proposal.

Additionally, the State claims that because the Union
failed to cost-out the financial impact of its proposal as
required by N.J.S.A. 34:13a-16f(3), the proposal may not be
awarded. Under the Union’s proposal, any time a Detective is
out of state overnight on an investigation or extradition, the
Detective would receive six hours of additional pay (i.e., four
hours of overtime pay at time-and-one-half) for “each night
spent out of state.”** Det. Neggia testified that Detectives
assigned to the Casino Unit are frequently required to perform
extraditions that require overnight stays. (1T129-130

That State opines that the second paragraph of Union's
proposal should also be rejected. The proposal would require
that Detectives be compensated for all travel time for approved
training that requires an overnight stay, as well as
compensation for any time a Detective is delayed in his/her

travels due to “circumstances outside of their control.” That

 

paragraph addresses a personal situation involving Det. Neggi:

* Union does not define how “night spent out of state” is to be determined.
It is unclear whether it means an entire night (i.e., 5:30 p.m. to 8:30
a.m.), any portion of a night (e.g., any time past 5:30 p.m.), or something
else.

94
A: Earlier this year, I believe it was January or
February, I went on two separate trips for ICAC,
Internet Crimes Against Children. In the course of
those two travels, I was delayed a number of hours, a
number of days because Newark Airport was basically
iced in and you cannot get out of our training
location and when I put the hours in to be reimbursed
for my time that I was actually out-of-state, I was
actually denied those hours, 25 hours total. So that's
why we have this provision in here to prevent that.

Q: The 25 hours would represent the time that you
normally would have worked had you been able to get
back; is that fair?

A: Correct. I wanted to get back. We could not get
back. The airport was closed.

Q: Are you aware of any other situation where that
occurred?

A: Not that I'm aware of. No. (3T179-180

The State argues that a collective negotiations agreement is

not the vehicle for addressing individual, personal peccadillos

I find that the FOP has not justified awarding additional
compensation for occasions when out-of-state travel is
necessary. And, apart from the one example of one employee
being stranded during a storm, the Union has not adequately
explained why its proposed language is needed.

I award the following:

An employee who is assigned to an investigation or

extradition, or who attends approved training, which

causes him/her to stay out of the State overnight

shall receive per diem reimbursement for lodging,

meals, and expenses consistent with the State

Department of the Treasury Travel Regulations. The

actual time spent traveling for the above-referenced

purposes shall be compensated as required by the
federal Fair Labor Standards Act.

95
MEAL BREAKS
The FOP proposes:
Work, for purposes of this Article, shall be
defined as any service performed which arises out
of the employee's status as a law enforcement
officer. Meal and break periods which occur
during periods of work shall be computed as work
time.
The meal breaks have been discussed and an award crafted in the
Hours of Work section. The Union has not justified why this
particular separate section is needed.
CALL IN TIME
The parties have each submitted a proposal for compensation
for “call-in” time. The main difference between the parties
proposals is the number of minimum hours for which the detective
will be compensated when called in to work. The FOP proposes
I. Call-In Time
When an employee is called in for duty outside his/her
normal tour of duty, or on a day when he/she is not
scheduled for duty, the employee shall be guaranteed a
minimum of four (4) hours compensation, whether or not
the four (4) hours are worked, except when the end of

the call-in period coincides with the beginning of
his/her scheduled shift.

 

The State propose
F,  Call-In Time

When an employee is called in for duty outside of
his/her scheduled work time, or on a day when he/she
is not scheduled for duty, the employee shall be
guaranteed a minimum of two (2) hours compensation,
regardless of the amount of time worked. The

96
guarantee shall not apply when the call-in period is
contiguous with the employee’s scheduled work time

The FOP argues that a review of the collective negotiations
agreements contained in Ex. FOP-19 illustrates that four hours
of compensation for “call-in” time is the accepted and/or normal
Practice. Moreover, as stated by Detective Neggia, there is no
uniform policy currently utilized by the Division to compensate
officers for “call-in” time. (37135) The form of compensation
for “call-in” time is usually dependent upon a detective’s
supervisor.

The FOP argues that its proposal will codify a detective's
compensation for being “called in” for duty and, thus, impose a
level of uniformity within the Division. Moreover, under FOP’s
proposal, the compensation given to Detectives will be
comparable to the amount provided to various other law
enforcement collective negotiations units. Four hours of
compensation is an adequate amount of compensation for the
members given the inconvenience of being “called in” and the
impact the same can have upon one’s personal life

The State argues that its proposal of a two-hour minimum
call-in pay is identical to all but one of the State’s law
enforcement Agreements. Every State 2011-2015 law enforcement
CNA containing a call-in time provision provides for a minimum
of two-hour compensation when the law enforcement officer is

called-in outside of the employee’s scheduled work time. (S-31:

a7.
FOP Lodge 174, Art. XXVI, Sec. F(4); PBA Local 105, Art. XXVII
Sec. (C); NJ Superior Officer Law Enforcement Assoc., Art
XXVII Sec. (C); NJ Law Enforcement Supervisors Assoc., Art. XXVI
Sec. (C); PBA State Law Enforcement Unit (SLEU), Art. XXVII Sec
(c).

The State points out that the State Police contract is the
only State law enforcement Agreement that has call-in time of
greater than two hours, and that contract only provides a
minimum of three hours of call-in time. (FOP-24, Art. V, Sec. C

The State argues that its proposal is consistent with of
the vast majority of its law enforcement contracts, and thus
supports the criteria of comparability with other similar
employees within the same jurisdiction. It maintains that the
Union has failed to establish that any greater minimum hours of
call-in time is necessary

I find that that the State’s proposed two-hour minimum is
supported by the fact that at least five other State law
enforcement units have a two-hour minimum call in benefit. The
Union has not justified its proposal for a four-hour minimum,
which even exceed that which the State Police have in its
contract. I award the following provision

F. Cali

 

In Time

When an employee is called in for duty outside of
his/her scheduled work time, or on a day when he/she
is not scheduled for duty, the employee shall be
guaranteed a minimum of two (2) hours compensation,
regardless ot the amount of time worked. The

98
guarantee shall not apply when the call-in period is
contiguous with the employee’s scheduled work time

SCHEDULE CHANGES

The FOP proposes:

H. Schedule changes

Any schedule change or shift change which is effective
on less than forty-eight (48) hours’ notice to the
employee shall cause the entire work obligation so
changed to be paid at the overtime rate. Change shall
be defined as an alteration from a regularly scheduled
work schedule. Work schedule changes shall be
communicated to the affected employees directly, in
person or telephonically, and through the State e-mail
system.

 

The State propose:

B. The Division will schedule each employee’s work

hours one (1) week in advance. Scheduled hours are

subject to change to meet operational needs

C. Employees shall be given as much advance notice as

practicable of changes in their scheduled hours of

work.

The FOP maintains that according to Detective Neggia
similar provisions are contained in the collective negotiations
agreements for the investigators/detectives of the various
county prosecutor’s offices.

The Union avers that this proposal will properly compensate
a detective when his/her schedule is altered on a moment's
notice due to emergent or non-emergent situations. In short
the proposal ensures the detectives will be compensated for the
impact such a change has on their personal lives without a

proper amount of notice. Moreover, the same will act as a

99
deterrent for the Division to alter a detective’s schedule for
disciplinary reasons or otherwise.

The FOP argues that the State’s proposal to provide
employees with “as much notice as practicable” for schedule
changes is inadequate and does nothing to compensate a detective
for such a monumental change in his/her employment and personal
life. Schedule changes that do not provide a detective with
adequate notice may result in the alteration of childcare and
other personal needs of a detective and his/her family. Thus,
when such a situation arises, such a contractual provision will
deter deleterious conduct of the Division. Consequently, the
FOP argues that its proposal should be awarded.

The State’s brief did not address this issue

The Union has not provided sufficient justification for its
proposal that a monetary penalty be imposed when schedule
changes occur within 48 hours of the change. The record does
not indicate with what frequency such changes occur and whether
the changes are to meet emergent circumstances, or simply the
employer’s failure to advise the detective of the need to work
different hours. I recognize that last-minute schedule changes
can be extremely disruptive to a detective’s personal life
However, given the nature of the work being performed by some
members of this bargaining unit, I expect that scheduling must
be arranged around the detection of crime, which of course does

not happen on a fixed schedule. Balancing the competing needs

100
of the Division and the interests of the employees, I award the
following:
A detective’s scheduled hours of work are subject to
change to meet operational needs. Employees shall be
given as much advance notice as practicable of changes
in their scheduled hours of work

QUT OF TITLE WORK

 

The FOP proposes:

An employee working in an out-of-title position

whether carrying the acting title or not, including,

but not limited to, Sergeant-State Investigator or

Lieutenant-State Investigator, shall upon the end of

the 4" bi-weekly pay cycle be paid at the salary of

the title he/she is working. The salary shall be the

rate of pay equivalent to a minimum of one (1) step up

within the acting title from the employee’s current

rate.

The FOP argues that its proposal is simple and
straightforward. In essence, FOP is requesting that, if a
detective is ordered to perform the work of a Sergeant and/or
Lieutenant for four consecutive pay cycles, immediately after
the fourth consecutive pay cycle, so long as he or she is still
performing the duties of the higher rank, the detective will
receive the compensation of the rank that they are serving in.
As indicated by Detective Donlan, since 2008 through the current
time, detectives have been performing the work of sergeants and
lieutenants for extended periods of time

Detective Donlan noted that a detectives in the South

office that has been serving in a sergeant’s billet for the past

three years and continues to receive his detective pay. (17122).

101
The Union claims this is a large problem within the Division as
management has no restraining mechanism in place to prevent them
from ordering detectives to serve in a higher rank without pay
As a result of these actions, management saves on the additional
expense associated with a promotion. This particular proposal
is directed towards stopping management's abusive behavior
Consequently, FOP implores the Arbitrator to grant this proposal
in its entirety as a matter of equity and fairness.

The State argues that the Union has offered only hearsay
testimony in support of this proposal. One of the only two
instances in which Dolan testified that an individual has been
working out-of-title involved an unnamed sergeant whom Dolan
claimed has been performing lieutenant's duties for a prolonged
period of time. (1T-121). Sergeants are excluded from this
negotiations unit. Such vague testimony cannot form a basis to
award the proposal sought here

Additionally, the State notes that of its other law
enforcement units, only the State Police contract has a
provision for out-of-title-work (FOP-24). The reason no such
provision exist is simple -- classified and unclassified
employees (including the Detectives here) in the State Service
have a right to seek a “desk audit” through Civil Service in the
event an employee contends that he or she is performing “out-of-
title work.” See N.J.A.C. 4A: 3-3.9. Accordingly, even if one

were to credit the testimony ot Donlan and assume that “out-of-

102
title” work occurs within the DCJ with any frequency, the
detectives in this unit have a regulatory remedy in place
nullifying any need for the provision sought here by Union

Nonetheless, not even the State Police Contract contains
Union's provision, The State Police provision on out-of-title
work provides:

Out-of-title work assignments occur when a member is
formally designated to occupy a position in an acting
capacity, which is structured at a higher rank in the
then currently published staffing tables of the
Division.

This Article governs out-of-title work issues and
compensation for time served in a formally designated
acting assignment at a higher rank for greater than
eight (8) bi-weekly pay periods and is applicable to
all enlisted members of the Division of State Police
When the Superintendent initiates a 369A or otherwise
designates in writing that a member will be assigned
to serve in an acting assignment at a higher rank, the
member will be eligible to receive the rate of pay of
the higher rank upon completion of eight (8) bi-weekly
pay periods of continuous service. The rate of pay of
the higher rank will be effective and payable to the
member for service in the higher rank subsequent to
the completion of the eight (8) bi-weekly pay periods.
Following completion of the eight (8) bi-weekly pay
periods, the member shall receive the rate of pay of
the higher rank until either promoted according to the
procedures adopted by the Superintendent or the acting
assignment is terminated. Any decision to initiate or
terminate any acting assignment shall be within the
sole discretion of the Superintendent and shall not be
subject to any grievance procedure contained in this
Agreement. Time served in an acting assignment at a
higher rank will not be given consideration toward any
promotional decision, toward computation of any
probationary period, and/or toward computation of
seniority at the higher rank. (Id., Art. XXII)
(emphasis added) .

 

103
Thus, New Jersey State Police are only entitled to be

compensated for out-of-title-work “for time served in a formally

designated acting assignment at a higher rank for greater than
eight (8) bi-weekly pay periods.” Id. (emphasis added). In

 

comparison, Union seeks out-of-title-work pay after only four
(4) bi-weekly pay periods “working in an out-of-title position.”
Unlike the provision in the expired State Police CNA, Union’s
Proposal has no requirement that the out-of-title work must be
“designat[ed] in writing” to fall under the provision. Thus, if
awarded in its present form, this proposal is likely to result
in disputes and grievances as to whether a detective has been
“working in an out-of-title position.” For the foregoing
reasons, the State argues that the Union’s proposal should be
rejected.

I find that the Union has justified the need for contract
language that would provide for compensation for employees being
asked to serve in the capacity of a superior officer for
extended periods of time. The State’s suggestion that
detectives put into the role of a superior officer could simply
request that civil service conduct a desk audit is an
unsatisfactory solution, as such a process is not expeditious
and may not necessarily result in the granting of compensation
for the employee for having served in the acting position. I

award the following:

104
An employee who has been designed by the Employer to
serve in an acting capacity as a superior officer
shall, upon the end of the 8‘ bi-weekly pay cycle, be
paid at the salary of the title he/she is working

The salary shall be Lhe rate of pay equivalent to a
minimum of one (1) step up within the acting title
from the employee's current rate. The rate of pay of
the higher rank will be effective and payable to the
member for service in the higher rank subsequent to
the completion of the eight (8) bi-weekly pay periods.
Following completion of the eight (8) bi-weekly pay
periods, the member shall receive the rate of pay of
the higher rank until either promoted or the acting
assignment is terminated. Any decision to initiate or
terminate any acting assignment shall be within the
sole discretion of the Employer and shall not be
subject to the grievance procedure.

HOTEL STAY
The FOP proposes,

In recognition of “Maggie’s Law,” N.J.S.A. 2C:11-5
the State understands that employees may be required
to work more than twenty-four (24) consecutive hours
and, as such, because of the requirements of the law
such employees shall be afforded a hotel/motel room
without cost to the employee or driven home at the end
of their shift when it exceeds twenty-four (24) hours
in duration.

The FOP argues that this proposal is consistent with “Maggie's

Law,” codified at N 2C:11-5. Moreover, the proposal is

 

consistent with the Division of Criminal Justice Standard
Operating Procedure #71, entitled “Driving While Fatigued,”
(POP-33). As such, FOP seeks nothing more than to clearly
delineate its members’ rights when they are required to work
more than 24 hours in duration. Given the proposal is

consistent with N.J.S.A, 2C:11-5 and the Division's long-

105
standing Standard Operating Procedure, that FOP argues that
there is no reason that the same should not be awarded

The State notes that SOP-71 which has been in place since
March 1, 2005. (FOP-33) Union’s stated intent for its proposal
is to formalize SOP-71 in the contract. However, the Stat
maintains, the problem with Union’s intent is that the proposal
addresses only a small aspect of SOP-71 --he provision of a
hotel room or a ride home to a detective who has worked greater
than twenty-four hours consecutively. The two-page SOP
addresses the rationale for Maggie’s Law, and provides an
explanation as to how and when the policy will be implemented as
well as a detailed procedure for “replacing and relieving
personnel.” (See FOP-33, Sec. 71-2, 71-4, and 71-5). Indeed, by
failing to incorporate the SOP in its entirety, Union’s proposal
either seeks significant changes to the current practice (for
which Union has failed to establish any basis) or, at a minimum,
will create significant confusion and numerous disputes. The
State therefore argues that the Union’s proposal should be
rejected.

I believe tht the State’s concerns about the Union’s
proposal not having incorporated the entire SOP into the
proposal language are unfounded. Section 71-2 of the SOP
provides the background of enactment of Maggie’s law
Section 71-4 deals with procedures on how supervisors are to

plan for replacement or relief of personnel who have not slept

106
within a 24-hour period. The FOP proposal captures the essence
of the SOP to which detectives have an interest; namely, that
they not be requircd to drive while fatigued in accordance with
Maggie’s Law. I award the following

There may be occasions when a detective is required to
work more than twenty-four (24) consecutive hours. In
accordance with “Maggie's Law,” N.J.S.A. 2C:11-5
detectives who are assigned to work such a shift

shall be afforded a hotel/motel room without cost to
the employee or driven home at the end of their shift
at the discretion of the supervisor. However, at the
conclusion of an eight-hour rest period, the detective
will be permitted to return to duty

 

HEALTH BENEFITS
The Union proposes:
Health Insurance and Fringe Benefits:

A. State Health Benefits Program

 

1. The State Health Benefits Program is applicable to
employees covered by this Contract. It is agreed that,
as part of that program, the State shall continue the
Prescription Drug Benefit Program during the period of
this Agreement to the extent it is established and/or
modified by the State Health Benefits Design
Committee, in accordance with P.L. 2011, c. 78. The
State Health Benefits Plan Design Committee shall
provide to employees the option to select one of at
least three levels of coverage each for family,
individual, individual and spouse, and individual and
dependent, or equivalent categories, for each plan
offered by the program differentiated by out of pocket
costs to employees including co-payments and
deductibles. Pursuant to P.L, 2011, c. 78, the State
Health Benefits Plan Design Committee has the sole
discretion to set the amounts for maximums, co-pays
deductibles, and other such participant costs for all
plans in the program and has the sole discretion to
set the amounts for maximums, co-pays, deductibles

and other such participant costs for all plans in the
program and has the sole discretion to determine the

107
plan design, plan components and coverage levels under
the program.

2. Medicare Reimbursement - Consistent with law, the
State will no longer reimburse active cmployees or
their spouses for Medicare Part B premium payments.

The State proposes:

A, State Health Benefits Program

 

As with any provisions of this Agreement that
reflect statutory or regulatory mandates, the
provisions of paragraphs (A 1-3), (B), (C) and (G)
of this Article, are for informational purposes only
and provide an explanation which is subject to
change due to legislative action. Any legislative
changes to the State Health Benefits Program that
occur during the term of this Collective
Negotiations Agreement shall apply to employees in
this negotiations unit at the same time and on same
terms as they apply to unrepresented State
employees. If the legislation provides that such
changes go into effect at the expiration of current
collective negotiations agreements, such changes
shall go into effect for this unit on July 1, 2015
or when the changes apply to other State law
enforcement collective negotiations units, excluding
State Police, whichever is later.

1. The State Health Benefits Program is applicable
to employees covered by this Contract. It is agreed
that, as part of that program, the State shall
continue the Prescription Drug Benefit Program
during the period of this Agreement to the extent it
is established and/or modified by the State Health
Benefits Design Committee, in accordance with P.L.
2011, c. 78. Pursuant to P.L. 2011, c. 78, the
State Health Benefits Plan Design Committee has the
sole discretion to set the amounts for maximums, co-
pays, deductibles, and other such participant costs
for all plans in the program and has the sole
discretion to determine the plan design, plan
components and coverage levels under the program.

2. Effective July 1, 2003, new hires are not
eligible for enrollment in the Traditional Plan.
The Traditional Plan and the NJ Plus POS Plan have
been abolished.

108
3. Medicare Reimbursement - Effective January 1,
1996, consistent with law, the State will no longer
reimburse active employees or their spouses for
Medicare Part B premium payments.

The key difference in the two proposals is that the State
seeks to have any legislative changes go into effect
immediately, whereas the Union seeks to continue the benefits
clause for the length of the contract unless the contract
language is superseded by any such legislative changes

I find merit in the FOP’s argument. The terms of the
contract should remain in effect for the contract length unless
changes are mandated by statute or the State Health Benefits
Commission, If the legislature enacts changes to the law and
makes such changes mandatorily immediately effective, then the
statutory provisions will control. If the legislature exempts
current contracts from any amended provisions, then the parties
current contract provisions will continue. I award the Union’s
proposal’? and add the following:

3. Any legislative changes regarding post-retirement

medical benefits that mandate immediate changes to

retiree benefits and/or contribution levels shall

supersede the provisions herein. If the legislation

provides that such changes go into effect at the
expiration of current collective negotiations

agreements, such changes shall go into effect for this
unit on July 1, 2019.

HEALTH BENEFIT CONTRIBUTIONS

* 4 see no value in adding the State’s proposed language concerning the
elimination of traditional plan or NJ Plus plan.

109
The Union proposes:

A. Contributions Towards Health and Prescription Benefits

 

1. Bmployees shall contribute, through the
withholding of the contribution from the pay, salary,
or other compensation, toward the cost of health care
benefits coverage for the employee and any dependent
provided under the State Health Benefits Program in an
amount that shall be determined in accordance with
section 39 of P.L. 2011, c. 78, except that, in
accordance with Section 40(a) of P.L. 2011, c. 78, an
employee employed on July 1, 2011 shall pay:

a) from implementation through June 30, 2012, one-
fourth of the amount of contribution;

b) from July 1, 2012 through June 30, 2013, one-half
of the amount of contribution;

c) from July 1, 2013 through June 30, 2014, three-
fourths of the amount of contribution; and

d) from July 1, 2014, the full amount of
contribution, as that amount is calculated in
accordance with section 39 of P.L. 2011 c. 78. After
full implementation, the contribution levels shall
become part of the parties’ collective negotiations
and shall then be subject to collective negotiations
in a manner similar to other negotiable items between
the parties.

The State proposes:

B. Contributions Towards Health and Prescription
Benefits

 

1. Except for any changes that occur in accordance
with Section A above, employees shall contribute
through the withholding of the contribution from the
pay, salary, or other compensation, toward the cost
of health care benefits coverage for the employee
and any dependent provided under the State Health
Benefits Program in an amount that shall be
determined in accordance with section 39 of

P.L. 2011, c. 78. If Section 39 of P.L. 2011,
Chapter 78 should expire during the term of this
Collective Negotiations Agreement, the contributions
required pursuant to Section 39 and this Collective

110
Negotiations Agreement shall continue for the
duration of this Collective Negotiations Agreement
unless the Legislature specifically enacts different
employee contribution levels for the State Health
Bencfite Program, which shall then govern

I award the following:

A. In accordance with section 39 of P.L. 2011, c. 78
employees shall contribute, through the withholding
from salary or other compensation, toward the cost of
health care benefits coverage for the employee and any
dependents provided under the State Health Benefits
Program. Effective July 1, 2014, employees shall
contribute the full amount of contribution as
calculated in accordance with section 39 of P.L. 2011,
c. 78.

B. Contributions Towards Health and Prescription
Benefits

 

1. If Section 39 of P.L. 2011, Chapter 78 should
expire during the term of this collective
negotiations agreement, the contributions required
pursuant to Section 39 and this Collective
Negotiations Agreement shall continue for the
duration of this agreement unless the Legislature
specifically enacts different employee contribution
levels for the State Health Benefits Program, which
shall then govern.

EYE CARE

The Union proposes:

B. Eye Care Program

cin Full-time employees and eligible dependents
shall be eligible for the State administered Eye Care
Program.

2. The Program shall provide for a $70.00 payment
for regular prescription lens or a $100.00 payment for
bifocal lens or more complex prescriptions. Included
are all eligible full-time employees and their
eligible dependents (spouse and unmarried children
under 23 years of age who live with the employee in a
regular parent-child relationship). The extension of

111
benefits to dependents shall be effective only after
the employee has been continuously employed for a
minimum of sixty (60) days.

a, Full-time employees and eligible dependents
shall be entitled to a maximum payment of $75.00 or
the non-reimbursed cost, whichever is less, of an eye
examination by an Ophthalmologist or Optometrist
during the two (2) year period ending June 30, 2016
and only one payment during the two (2) year period
commencing July 1, 2016.

4. Each eligible employee and dependent may
receive only one (1) payment for glasses and one
payment for examination during the period of July 1,
2014-June 30, 2016 and one payment for glasses and one
payment for examination during the period of July 1,
2016-June 30, 2018.

The State proposes:

D. Eye Care Program

1. It is agreed that the State shall continue the
Eye Care Program during the period of this Contract
The coverage shall provide for a $40.00 payment for
regular prescription lens or $45.00 for bifocal lens
or more complex prescriptions. Included are all
eligible full-time employees and their eligible
dependents (spouse and unmarried children under 26
years of age who live with the employee in a regular
parent-child relationship). The extension of benefits
to dependents shall be effective only after the
employee has been continuously employed for a minimum
of sixty (60) days.

2. Full-time employees and eligible dependents as
defined above shall be eligible for a maximum payment
of $35.00 or the non-reimbursed cost, whichever is
less, of an eye examination by an Ophthalmologist or
an Optometrist.

3. Each eligible employee and dependent may receive
only one payment for glasses and one payment for
examinations during the period of July 1, 2015 to June
30, 2017 and one payment for glasses and one payment
for examination during the period of July 1, 2017 to
June 30, 2019. This program ends on June 30, 2019.

112
Proper affidavit and submission of receipts are
required of the employee in order to receive payments.

The FOP argues that, through its proposal, it seeks an
allotment for prescription eyeglasses in the amount of $70 and,
for bifocal lenses, one hundred dollars ($100.00). It also seeks
a seventy-five dollar ($75.00) allotment for eye examinations.
Moreover, the proposal seeks these allotments every two (2)
years while the collective negotiations agreement is in effect.*

The FOP argues that this proposal would assist detectives
in paying for these services and products as the same are not
covered under the State Health Benefit Plan. According to
Neggia, even if FOP’s proposal were awarded, the members would
still have some out of pocket expenses for glasses and eye
examinations.

The FOP argues that the cost of living has increased over
the past several years and will continue to increase. FOP’s
proposed allotments for these services and products recognize
this increase and seek to pay members a sufficient amount toward
the same. Consequently, this proposal is more than reasonable
and, thus, should be awarded in its entirety

The State opposes the increases in the eye care program as
proposed by the Union. It argues that (1) the design of the

program is to defray the cost of eye care and frames and lenses

16 Neggia testified that he read the proposal as applying at least the eye
exam benefit every year. [4T139-140] However, this is not what the FOP’s
Final Offer provides.

 

113
and the $35 covers the cost of the deductible for an eye exam
which is covered under the SHBP; and, (2) the program is the
same across all bargaining units and also applies to the non-
aligned employees. Given the anticipated large and
uncontrollable increases in health benefits, it would make no
sense increase this benefit or to carve out a different program
for this small unit.

The State’s proposal in section D(3) asks to make
reimbursement available during contractually set 2-year periods
i.e, 2015-2016 and again 2016-2018. It also proposes that to
sunset the benefit provisions on June 30, 2019. The State
asserts that this proposal is a benefit cost containment
measure, should the State decide to modify or end the program at
the agreement's expiration.

I find that neither the State’s proposal nor the Union's
proposal is entirely justified. As to the Union’s proposal to
increase the reimbursement levels, it must be noted that no
other bargaining unit in State government has an eyecare
reimbursement rate of greater than the plan that currently
exists for DCJ detectives. The Union’s complaint that the plan
does not cover the costs of eyeglasses or frames has merit;
however, the plan does not appear to be intended to completely
cover such costs; rather, it is intended to partially offset

such costs. I am not inclined to give an increased benefit to

114
this bargaining unit for eyecare that would put it out of parity
with all other State units.

As to the State’s proposal to make the benefit available in
specified two-year increments, this is inconsistent with other
State contracts and ignores the possibility that some employees
did not receive a reimbursement in the last two years, or need
glasses for the first time in 2014. Therefore, language
permitting reimbursement once in a two-year period is more
appropriate. Finally, I decline to include language that would
sunset the clause upon the expiration of the contract. The
State’s proffered reason that it wants the option to terminate
the program if it wishes flies in the face of collective
negotiations, is inconsistent with the provisions of other State
contracts, and is not in the public interest, which favors
collective negotiation over unilateral action. I award the
following:

1. It is agreed that the State shall continue the Eye

Care Program during the period of this Contract.

Included are All eligible full-time employees and

their eligible dependents (spouse and unmarried

children under 26 years of age who live with the

employee in a regular parent-child relationship) are

covered under this program. The extension of benefits

to dependents shall be effective only after the

employee has been continuously employed for a minimum

of sixty (60) days.

2. Eligible employees and eligible dependents as

defined above shall be eligible for a maximum payment

of $35.00 or the non-reimbursed cost, whichever is

less, of an eye examination by an Ophthalmologist or
an Optometrist during a two-year period.

115
3. Eligible employees and eligible dependent as
defined above shall be eligible for a maximum payment
of $40 for single vision eyeglasses or $45 for bifocal
or complex lenses during a two-year period.

Finally, the State proposes

E. The provisions of Sections (A.1-3), (B), (C) and
(G) of this Article are for informational purposes
only and are not subject to the contractual
grievance/arbitration provisions of Article 2

The State maintains that this provision appropriately
excludes disputes concerning these fringe benefits from the
grievance and arbitration procedure and is consistent with the
language contained in the negotiated agreements between the
State and its other negotiation units. The FOP asserts that
there is no basis to exclude health benefits from the grievance
procedure. I award the State’s proposal as it is consistent
with language contained in the State’s other negotiations units
contracts.

HEALTH INSURANCE IN RETIREMENT

The Union proposes:

i. Those employees who have 20 or more years of
creditable service on the effective date of P.L. 2011
c. 78, who accrue 25 years of pension credit or retire
on a disability retirement on or after July 1, 2011
will contribute 1.5% of the monthly retirement
allowance toward the cost of post-retirement medical
benefits as is required under law. Those employees
who have fewer than 20 years of creditable service on
June 28, 2011, and who accrue 25 years of pension
credit and retire on or after July 1, 2011, will
contribute toward the cost of post-retirement medical
benefits in accordance with P.L. 2011, c. 78. In
accordance with P.L. 2011, c. 78, the Retiree Wellness
Program no longer applies.
2. The State agrees to assume, upon retirement,
the full cost of the Health Benefits coverage for the
State employees and their dependents including the
cost of charges under the Part B of the Federal
Medicare Program for cligible employees and their
spouses, but not including survivors, for employees
who accrue 25 years of pension credit service, as
provided under the State plan, by July 1, 1997, and
those employees who retire on disability on the basis
of fewer years of pension credit in the State plan by
July 1, 1997.

3. Employees who accrue 25 years of pension credit
service after June 30, 2007, and before June 30, 2011,
will be eligible to receive post-retirement medical
benefits (“PRM”) in accordance with applicable law in
effect at that time. Such employees will be eligible
to participate in the applicable PPO or HMO and will
pay 1.5% of pension benefit as a contribution to the
cost of PRM, but such contribution shall be waived if
the retiree participates in the Retiree Wellness
Program. Participation shall mean that the retiree
completes the designated HRA form at the time of
retirement, participates in the annual health
assessment, and participates in any individualized
health counseling, follow-up, or program developed for
that individual. There shall be an annual
verification from the appropriate person at the
Retiree Wellness Program in which the retiree is
participating.

4. Employees hired on or after July 1, 1995, will
not receive any reimbursement for Medicare Part B
after retirement.

Se Employees who elect deferred retirement are not
entitled to health benefits under this provision.

 

The State propose!

118
f. Violations of this Article are not subject to the
grievance/arbitration procedures of this Agreement.

g. Any legislative changes regarding post-retirement
medical benefits that occur during the term of this
Collective Negotiations Agreement, including but not
limited to contribution levels, shall apply to this
negotiations unit at the same time and on the same

terms as they apply to unrepresented State

changes go into effect at the expiration of current

collective negotiations agreements, such changes shall

go into effect for this unit on July 1, 2015 or when

the changes apply to other State law enforcement

collective negotiations units, excluding State Police

whichever is later.

The FOP asserts that the major difference between its
proposal and the State’s proposal is the State’s inclusion of
language that would make any legislatively imposed changes to
the contribution level of retirees to become effective
immediately, notwithstanding the terms of any collective
negotiations agreement that may be in effect at the time. In
addition, the State seeks language that any violations of this
contract article would not be subject to the grievance/
arbitration provisions contained in the contract.

The FOP urges rejection of the State’s proposal as it would
allow any contract language to immediately be superseded by
legislative changes, thus rendering this contract article null
and void. Moreover, the Union contends, in proposing this
article to fall outside the purview of the grievance/arbitration

procedures, the entitlements contained therein are not

enforceable. The FOP argues that its proposal clearly
identifies and/or delineates the rights of retirees with regard
to healthcare contributions and must be awarded.

The State argues that it is appropriate to exclude disputes
over retirees’ health benefits from the grievance procedure
Further, it argues that any legislative changes should be given
immediate effect in furtherance of cost containment.

First I find that the State has not sustained its burden of
justifying the exclusion of health benefits for retirees from
the grievance arbitration clause. The Union has the right to
seek enforcement of its collective agreement, even where the
agreement incorporates statutory provisions

Second, the provisions of Chapter 78 concerning health
benefits are due to sunset. Upon its expiration, this contract
will still be in effect. Chapter 78 provides that upon
expiration of the statute, the provisions will be treated as
part of collective agreements, to be subsequently negotiated by
the parties. If the legislature enacts changes to the law and
makes such changes mandatorily immediately effective, then the
statutory provisions will control. If the legislature exempts
current contracts from any amended provisions, then the parties
current contract provisions will continue. I award the Union's
proposal and add the following:

£. Any legislative changes regarding post-retirement

medical benefits that mandate immediate changes to

retiree benefits and/or contribution levels shall

supersede the provisions herein. If the legislation
provides that such changes go into effect at the

120
expiration of current collective negotiations

agreements, such changes shall go into effect for this

unit on July 1, 2015.

DEATH BENEFIT

The Union proposes the following language

The State will provide to the estate of an employee

killed in the line of duty a twenty-five thousand

dollar ($25,000.00) benefit which may be in addition

to those benefits provided by any State or Federal

administered pension program or insurance program.

The Union argues that this proposal would provide $25,000
to the estate of an employee killed in the line of duty, in
addition to any other benefits the estate might receive as a
matter of law or otherwise. According to Neggia, a similar
provision is contained in the collective negotiations agreement
for the Investigators/Detectives of the Essex County
Prosecutor's Office. Neggia explained the purpose behind the
proposal:

We do some very dangerous duties rather than just

strictly office type investigations so we felt as

through if God forbid something happened to one of our

Detectives, they wanted to provide for educational

benefits to their children or however they see fit for

the spouses or others to spend that money on behalf of

the family. (37145)

Given the members’ status as sworn law enforcement
officers, the FOP asserts that its proposal should be awarded.
The very nature of being a law enforcement officer is that you
are putting your life on the line every day you report to work

In the unfortunate event a detective was ever killed, this

proposal would help his/her family immensely by ensuring some

121
financial stability. As a matter of practicality, the proposal
should be awarded.

The State argues that these employees already have a death
benefit which is provided by statute. In addition to a non-
contributory life insurance benefits paid through the
detectives’ retirement system (which represents a lump sum
payment of 3.5 times a detective’s annual salary), the
spouse/child/children of a detective killed in the line of duty
is/are entitled to receive 70%, 20%, or 35%, respectively, of

the detective’s pension. N.J.S.A. 43:16A-10. Additionally

 

effective January 13, 2014, the family of a detective killed in
the performance of his/her duties are reimbursed for up to
$10,000 of the detective’s funeral expenses. N.J.S.A. 52:18A-
218.2. By any standard, the State argues, the benefits to which
these detectives already are entitled are generous

I agree with the State. The statutory entitlement to three
and a half times the employee’s salary in the event of death is
sufficient insurance against an employee's death. The Union's
proposal for an additional $25,000 insurance policy is denied
EDUCATIONAL INCENTIVE

The FOP proposes:

1. In order to recognize the achievement of the

employee's educational advancements, the State shall

provide an annual education incentive payment for

employees who attain the following degrees:

60 credits or Associates - $500.00
Bachelors - $1,000.00

122
Master's and above - $1,500.00

2. To qualify for Educational Incentive pay, all
credits and degrees must be from an institution
accredited by a nationally recognized accrediting
association, such as the Middle States Association of
Colleges and Schools.

3. The Educational Incentive payment is an annual
lump sum payment, which shall not be added to the base
salary.

4, Educational Incentive payments are not

cumulative. The employee shall only be entitled to the
amount at the highest degree they hold.

5. The Educational Incentive payment shall be made

on or before June 30 of each fiscal year. The employee

must have attained the degree or the earned requisite

credits by July 1 to receive the payment for that

fiscal year. If not, the employee shall commence

receiving the payment in the next fiscal year

The FOP notes that it is not seeking to compound these
educational incentive payments. Rather, a detective will only
be eligible to receive a single payment based upon the highest
degree achieved.

FOP’s contends that its proposal is identical in form and
substance to the educational incentive provision contained in
the collective negotiations agreement between the State and the
STFA. Again, the FOP is seeking nothing more than the award of a
comparable benefit already being provided to negotiations unit
that also falls under the purview of the Division of Criminal
Justice and/or the State Attorney General. Moreover, a similar

educational incentive is provided to many detectives of the

various county prosecutor’s offices. (FOP-34.) As a matter of

123
equity, FOP’s educational incentive provision should be awarded
in order to maintain consistency within the Division of Criminal
Justice itself and the various county prosecutor's offices.

The State maintains that this proposal should be denied.

It points out that the Union proposal would award employees
based upon the degree earned, regardless of the area of study
the degree may be in. Further, it responds that, contrary to
Neggia’s testimony that “a lot of county prosecutor’s offices
and some State law enforcement contract have this benefit, a
review of Union’s fringe benefit survey chart, (FOP-11), shows
that 13 of New Jersey’s 21, or 61%, pay no educational
incentive. Of the 8 counties that do pay an incentive, four pay
less than Union proposes. This comparison militates against
Union's offer.

The State further argues that a review of the State’s law
enforcement contracts warrants the same conclusion. Of the 7
law enforcement contracts, only the State Police contract
provides for an educational incentive.

The State also argues that, while an educational incentive
benefit presumably incentivizes employees to obtain advanced
education, here, “graduation from an accredited college or
university with a Bachelor's degree” is a prerequisite for being

WW

hired as a Detective. Further, Pentony testified that nearly

"The Detective II and I Job Specifications, (FOP-2, and ~3), provide that
“Applicants who do not possess the required education may substitute
additional experience as required on a year-for-year basis with thirty (30)

124
all bargaining unit members hold at least a BA degree and many
hold master’s degrees, law degrees, or higher. Thus, Union is
seeking annual incentive pay that is based on degrees which
almost all detectives earned before being hired

Finally, the State notes that the proposal would be
fiscally prohibitive and irresponsible. Exhibit 37 of FOP-18
Dr. Young’s report, contains a list of what appears to be the
Unit members and the degrees they hold. As Union offered no
testimony on this chart we will presume that in the column
titled “Degree” “A” stands for associates degree, “B” bachelor’s
degree, “M” master’s degree, and “JD” juris doctorate. Using
the information provided in Exhibit 37, Union’s proposal would
require the State to pay at least $121,000 in educational
incentive each year of the Agreement, or $484,000 over the life
of the contract. Thus, the State argues, consideration of the
proposal under criteria N.J.S.A. 34:13A-16g(1) and (6) militates
against awarding it.

I have considered the arguments of both parties. First
Chief of Detectives Morris, who have an extensive background
with the State police, testified that troopers are not
necessarily required to hold a bachelor’s degree as a pre-

requisite for appointment to a trooper position. Thus, in that

 

semester hour credits being equal to one (1) year of experience.” The
Detective II and I Job Specifications also provide that [continued

“A Master's degree . . . may be substituted for one (1) year of indicated
experience.” The Detective Trainee Job Specification (FOP-1) does not contain
these substitution options.

125
context, the State has an interest in providing an incentive to
its troopers to seek advanced degrees. Here, however, the
detectives are required to hold at least a bachelor’s degree.
But like the troopers group, the State does have an interest in
providing an incentive to detectives to seek additional
education beyond the minimum requirement for the position. A
better educated work group is a benefit to the Division and to
the employees themselves. Further, there is record evidence
that about half of the units of county prosecutor’s detectives
have educational incentive programs. Therefore, I award the
following effective July 1, 2015:

1. In order to recognize the achievement of the

employee's educational advancements, the State shall

provide an annual education incentive payment for

employees who attain the following advanced degrees:

Master's - $1,000
PhD/JD - $1,500.

2. To qualify for Educational Incentive pay, all
credits and degrees must be from an institution
accredited by a nationally recognized accrediting
association, such as the Middle States Association of
Colleges and Schools

3. The Educational Incentive payment is an annual
lump sum payment, which shall not be added to the base
salary.

4, Educational Incentive payments are not

cumulative. The employee shall only be entitled to
the amount at the highest degree they hold.

5. The Educational Incentive payment shall be made
on or before June 30 of each fiscal year. The employee
must have attained the degree or the earned requisite
credits by July 1 to receive the payment for that

126
fiscal year. If not, the employee shall commence
receiving the payment in the next fiscal year

The cost of providing this benefit is $21,000 ($1,500 x 2
employees + $1,000 x 18 employees)
TUITION REIMBURSEMENT

The Union proposes the following Article

A. In accordance with N.J.A.C. 4A:6-4.6, employees
may be eligible for tuition reimbursement for post-
secondary courses (taken at a properly accredited
educational institution) which are directly job
related and/or necessary to increase such employee's
expertise in his or her area of work, as determined by
the Chief of Detectives, provided the employee is not
being reimbursed for the same course(s) from other
sources, such as the L.E.E.P. and/or the V.A.

1. The maximum reimbursement per credit shall be
equivalent to the tuition at the State Colleges or the
actual tuition, whichever is less.

2. Approved courses shall be taken during off-duty
hours.
B. Written application must be made through channels

to the Office of Attorney General’s Fiscal Office,
prior to enrollment in a course of study, stating the
basis for the request for reimbursement. Within twenty
(20) calendar days, a response will be made in writing
as to whether or not the Division will provide
reimbursement subject to the availability of funds.

In order to secure reimbursement, the employee must
complete the course of study and maintain a course
grade of not less than "C" or its equivalent at the
undergraduate level, or satisfactory for program
completion in graduate study. Written proof of payment
of tuition must be submitted to the Division along
with a copy of the final grade received

Tuition reimbursement shall ordinarily not exceed
twelve (12) credits per year.

C. The operation of this program is subject to the
availability of funds. In the event that funds are

127
not sufficient to meet all requests which would

otherwise be approvable, the State may provide tuition

reimbursement at less than full cost.

The FOP argues that this benefit is also available to the
State troopers unit. (FOP-24) Detective Neggia further
indicated that the Division of Criminal Justice provided tuition
reimbursement to FOP members, including him, in previous years
when the funds were available to do so

The FOP notes that its proposal is subject to the
availability of funds. Therefore, any concerns put forth by the
State regarding the same should be somewhat assuaged. The FOP
contends that the provision should be awarded so as to codify
the Division’s past practice and grant the Detectives a right to
this benefit when adequate funding is available. Moreover, by
engaging in such a reimbursement system, the Division of
Criminal Justice will surely benefit from better educated
Detectives.

The State argues that, like reimbursements for training,
the issue of tuition aid program is codified in a Department of
Law and Public Safety SOP, which provides for a procedure to
such reimbursement subject to available funding. The State
points out that the provisions of this SOP are based upon the
provisions contained in N.J.A.C. 4:A6-4.6. It notes that
except for the State troopers contract, other law enforcement
contract simply contain a provision that states, “The tuition

aid program shall be administered consistent with N.J.A.C. 4A:6-

 

128
4.6.” Therefore, the State asserts that, if any language
should be awarded on this subject, it should be limited to the
same language and/or a reference to the SOP

I find that the FOP’s proposal closely tracks the SOP which
is based upon the civil service regulation in Section 4A. I
award the following:

A. In accordance with N.J.A.C. 4A:6-4.6, employees
may be eligible for tuition reimbursement for post-
secondary courses (taken at a properly accredited
educational institution) which are directly job
related and/or necessary to increase such employee's
expertise in his or her area of work, as determined by
the Chief of Detectives, provided the employee is not
being reimbursed for the same course(s) from other
sources, such as the L.E.E.P. and/or the V.A.

 

1. The maximum reimbursement per credit shall be
equivalent to the tuition at the State Colleges or the
actual tuition, whichever is less.

2. Approved courses shall be taken during off-duty
hours.
B. Written application must be made through channels

to the Office of Attorney General's Fiscal Office
prior to enrollment in a course of study, stating the
basis for the request for reimbursement. Within twenty
(20) calendar days, a response will be made in writing
as to whether or not the Division will provide
reimbursement subject to the availability of funds

In order to secure reimbursement, the employee must
complete the course of study and maintain a course
grade of not less than "C" or its equivalent at the
undergraduate level, or satisfactory for program
completion in graduate study. Written proof of payment
of tuition must be submitted to the Division along
with a copy of the final grade received.

Tuition reimbursement shall ordinarily not exceed
twelve (12) credits per year

129
DUTY,

D. The operation of this program is subject to the
availability of funds.

OFFICER/UNIT PHONE MONITOR

 

The FOP proposes:

A. The parties hereby expressly acknowledge the Division of
Criminal Justice maintains 24/7 communications systems
monitored by a Duty Officer and Unit Phone Monitors. This
position requires the Duty Officer and Unit Phone Monitors
to receive and transmit communications. Some calls can be
emergent in nature, i.e. including, but not limited to
statewide police officer involved shootings, environmental
crimes, human trafficking, bias crimes and/or other
emergent issues.

B. An Employee who is assigned to be a Duty Officer or Unit
Phone Monitor shall be paid $500.00 for every 2 weeks of
assignment, to be paid the following month. An employee
who is a Backup Duty Officer or Backup Unit Phone Monitor
and who takes control of duties will receive $35.00 per
day.

C. In accordance with the Division of Criminal Justice
Standard Operating Procedure 19, no Detective shall be
requested to staff the Position of Duty Officer

The FOP witness, Neggia testified about the purpose of this

proposal:

What we are trying to get at here in this request is,
that there are certain Detectives that work in the
Bias Crime Unit and work in the Human Trafficking Unit
that handle an on-call phone. It's basically a
hotline which the Attorney General’s Office puts out
these flyers with I believe it is an 800 number or
toll free number where people who want to report
instances of bias crime and/or human trafficking would
call this number. I believe it is manned 24/7. These
Detectives in this particular unit are required to
answer this phone on a 24/7 basis. I believe they
rotate it through the unit. We just want this
provision to recognize them and compensate them for
actually handling that particular work for the
Division.. (37149150

130
The Union argues that, given the responsibilities of
serving as the duty officer and/or unit phone monitor,
detectives are subjected to restrictions in their personal lives
when serving in this position. For example, these detectives
cannot drink alcohol and/or travel far away from home in the
event the phone needs to be answered or a call has to be
responded to. According to Neggia, the detectives assigned to
these positions are either: (1) not compensated; or (2) given
compensatory time off. Suffice it to say, there is no practice
that is consistently followed

The FOP argues that this contractual provision will ensure
there are definitive criteria as to how detectives are
compensated for serving in these positions. Consequently, FOP's
proposal should be awarded

The State responds that the Union proposes that detectives
be compensated $500 every two-weeks for carrying a “duty
officer” cellphone (which are carried by lieutenants), and $35
per day for carrying the human trafficking unit cell phone -
which receives an average of two and five calls, respectively
each week. The State argues that the Union has established no
basis upon which to award this additional compensation.*®

Chief Morris was more knowledgeable as to the “hotline”

telephones and who is responsible for monitoring them.

#8 As proposed, the offer equates to an estimated annual cost to the State of
$37,920: ($500 x 26 weeks of Duty Phone pay = $13,000; and $35.00 x 365 days
of Human Trafficking Unit phone duty = $24,920).

131
According to Morris, the duty officer cell phone, which
receives an average of four calls in each two-week
assignment, is the responsibility of and is monitored by
lieutenants (47-135).

The cell phone for the human trafficking unit may be
monitored by detectives. An average of five calls is received
on that phone weekly, and may or may not require immediate
action by the detective who answers the call.

The State asserts that, contrary to Neggia’s belief, the
“hotline” for the bias unit is a landline, not a cell phone
that is used primarily for collecting data. The line is also
tied into the bias units in the 21 counties prosecutors’ offices
as well as DCJ. The State argues that the Union has established
no basis for the establishing this new and excessive monetary
benefit. As such the proposal should be rejected

I award a modified version of the Union’s proposal. There
are three separate situations where DCJ employees are possibly
“on call”: duty officer, the human trafficking unit hotline
and possibly the bias crimes unit hotline. It is unclear from
the record whether detectives are actually ever asked to assume
the position of duty officer, as the SOP states that the
responsibility is one assigned to lieutenants. It is also
unclear whether they are assigned to monitor the bias crimes
Unit hotline. But detectives definitely are assigned to the

human tratticking phone. I agree with the Union that employees

132
deserve some compensation for the intrusion into their personal
lives when undertaking this assignment. Therefore, I award the
following:

A. An detective who is assigned to be a duty officer

or unit phone monitor shall be paid $35 per day for

such assignment. Payment will be made within 30 days

of completion of the period of continuous assignment.**
If, as the State suggests, no detective is assigned as duty
officer or assigned to monitor the bias crime hotline, then the
State will have no cost to this unit associated with the
assignment. The annual cost for monitoring each “hotline” would
be $12,775.

TIME OFF:

The FOP proposes:

A. Vacation
1. Upon separation from the State or upon retirement, an

employee shall be entitled to vacation allowance for the
current year prorated upon the number of months worked in
the calendar year in which the separation or retirement
becomes effective and any vacation leave which may have
been carried over from the preceding calendar year

2. If a permanent employee dies, having earned
vacation credits, a sum of money equal to the

compensation figured on his salary rate, at the time
of death, shall be calculated and paid to his estate

3. Each employee covered by this Agreement may, at
his option, carry forward up to one year's earned
vacation.

A Vacation

 

1 T have not awarded the Union's proposal that restricting DCJ from assigning
detectives as duty officers. First this proposal is inconsistent with it
proposal for compensation for the assignment. Second, I believe that the
designation of personnel to handle the duty ofticer assignment is a
managerial prerogative.

133
2. Vacation leave shall be taken during the calendar
year in which it is earned. An employee may request
in writing, that he/she be granted vacation carryover
into the next year in cases where his/her workload
would not permit the individual’s requested vacation
schedule. This request must first be approved by the
Chief of State Investigators or his/her designee. at
the discretion of, and with the written authorization
of the Attorney General, the Director, Division of
Criminal Justice, or designee, vacation carryover into
the next calendar year may be authorized up to the
total number of unused vacation days earned in the
previous year. However, in no event shall carryover
be more than five (5) days, unless the press of
business dictates otherwise.

3. | Any unused vacation leave remaining at the time

of separation or retirement from State service, may

either be utilized or satisfied by lump sum

reimbursement (not to exceed one year’s accrued

vacation time) at the discretion and with the written

authorization of the Attorney General and the division

director or his/her designee.
The parties have agreed on the amount of vacation allowance for
detectives, based upon length of service. The parties disagree
over approval for vacation leave carryover, payment for unused
vacation upon separation from service or death of the employee

The Union argues that its proposal merely seeks to codify
the existing vacation leave benefit

The State argues that if codifying the existing benefit is
the Union’s intent, then it should agree that the State’s
proposal is substantively and materially identical to the DCJ’s

SOP-06, (FOP-14), which has been in effect since January 1996.

SOP-06 provides in relevant part:

134
Vacation leave should be taken during the calendar
year in which it is earned. A State [Detective] may
request, in written memorandum form, that he/she be
granted vacation carryover into the next year in

vases where his/her workload would not permit a

normal vacation schedule. This request shall be

forwarded through, and approved by, the appropriate

Chain of Command to the Chief [Detectives]. At the

direction of, and with the written authorization of

the Attorney General, the Director, Division of

Criminal Justice, or designee, vacation carryover

into the next calendar year may be authorized up to

the total number of unused vacation days earned in

the previous year. However, every attempt should be

made to reduce carryover to no more than five days

unless the State [detective]’s investigative workload

dictates otherwise.

The State argues that the awarding of the Union’s proposal
would substantially and significantly change the DCJ’s policy
and practice. In particular, the Union’s proposal would permit
each detective the ability to carry forward up to one full
year’s worth of vacation time, for any reason or no reason, at
the detective’s discretion. The current policy, as stated in
FOP-14 and mirrored by the State’s proposal, permits detectives
the right to request that up to five days of vacation time be
carried forward to the following year further providing
(consistent with the current practice) that greater carryover
may be approved when the “press of business dictates otherwise.”

The FOP argues that its proposal pertaining to how vacation
leave is calculated for an employee who is separated from State

service and/or retires is in complete accordance with N.J.A.C.

4A:6-1.5 and N.J.S.A. 11A:6-2 and, thus, must be awarded as a

135
matter of law. Moreover, it avers that the language is similar
to provisions contained in every other State law enforcement
collective negotiations agreements currently in effect. (FOP-
19) The State’s proposal, on the other hand, fails to recognize
the mandates of the applicable statutes and/or regulations
Additionally, it asserts, the State’s proposal seems to indicate
a detective would need certain approvals in order to obtain
payment for such leave and/or utilize the same.

Secondly, the FOP argues that its proposal on the method of
calculating how unused vacation credits would be paid to an

employee’s estate was drafted after reviewing the express

 

wording contained in N. « 4A:6-1.2(j), which mandates how

 

unused vacation credits are paid. As such, the proposal must be
awarded as a matter of law as the same is mandated by
regulation. The FOP argues that similar provisions are
contained in every other State law enforcement agreement
currently. (FOP-19)

Further, the parties dispute the amount of vacation days a
Detective can carryover from one year to the next. The FOP
maintains that its proposal seeks to carry over up to one year
of unused vacation, while the State’s proposal would only allow
a detective to carryover a maximum of five days. As indicated
by Neggia, FOP’s proposal is consistent with the Division’s
current practice. Additionally, its proposal is identical to the

one contained in the STFA collective negotiations agreement.

136
The FOP argues that therefore, the State is attempting to
deprive FOP a benefit afforded to all other State units

Finally, the FOP asserts that its proposal concerning
carryover of vacation leave make more fiscal and operational
sense. If employees are only permitted to carryover only five
vacation days from year to year, they are going to “use it or
lose it.” Some employees will not be able to take the vacation
time during the year due to operational needs. Thus, being able
to carryover only five days may cause an onslaught of vacation
time being utilized at the end of the year. Significant
overtime may be required to backfill for those taking vacation
or alternatively, offices may be operated under minimal staffing
levels. For these reasons, the State’s proposal should be
rejected and FOP’s proposals awarded in their totality

Concerning the issue of vacation leave carryover, it
appears that the Union’s proposal and the State’s proposal do
not mirror the existing practice. I intend to award the
existing practice as recited in SOP #6 as follows:

Vacation leave should be taken during the calendar

year in which it is earned. A detective may request

in written memorandum form, that he/she be granted

vacation carryover into the next year in cases where

his/her workload would not permit a normal vacation

schedule. This request shall be forwarded through

and approved by, the appropriate Chain of Command to

the Chief of Detectives. At the direction of, and

with the written authorization of the Attorney

General, the Director, Division of Criminal Justice

or designee, vacation carryover into the next

calendar year may be authorized up to the total
number of unused vacation days earned in the previous

137
upon

year. However, every attempt should be made to
reduce carryover to no more than five days unless the
State detective’s investigative workload dictates
otherwise.

As to the issue of cashing out unused vacation time

a detective’s retirement, I award the following

language:

SICK

 

4, Upon separation from the State or upon
retirement, an employee shall be entitled to vacation
allowance for the current year prorated upon the
number of months worked in the calendar year in which
the separation or retirement becomes effective and any
vacation leave which may have been carried over from
the preceding calendar year

5. If a permanent employee dies, having earned
vacation credits, a sum of money equal to the

compensation figured on his salary rate, at the time
of death, shall be calculated and paid to his estate

LEAVE
The Union proposes the following language
B. Sick Time

1. Every employee covered by this Agreement shall
earn payment for absence due to illness (Sick Leave
at the rate of fifteen (15) days per year, which shall
accumulate at the rate of 1.25 days per month that is
worked during the first calendar year of employment.

2. Employees shall be credited for each subsequent
calendar year thereafter, fifteen (15) days as of the
first day of the calendar year

Unused sick days shall accumulate year to year
without limit.

4, After an employee has used five (5) continuous
sick days, the employer shall have the right to demand
that the employee furnish a note from his doctor that
the employee was in fact ill.

138
seq:

5. Upon retirement, the employee may use sick leave
for thirty (30) days immediately prior to the date of
retirement without need of a doctor’s note. This
shall be contingent on the employee having thirty (30
days remaining after Lhe cash payment pursuant to
Article of this contract. In the event an
employee has less than thirty (30) sick days remaining
after the cash payment, he shall be permitted to be
absent without a doctor’s note for said lesser number
of days immediately prior to retirement.

   

Pursuant to N A. 11A:6-16 and N » 4A:6-1.3, et

1. Employees will earn sick leave at the rate of
one (1) day per month for the first calendar year and
will be credited with fifteen (15) days of sick leave
each year thereafter.

2. Unused sick leave may be carried over to the next
calendar year with no restrictions.

3. Sick leave may be used for:
a. Illness;
b. Death of an immediate family member;
c. Care of a seriously ill member of the

employee’s immediate family
4, Proof of Illness

Proof of illness or injury may be required if there is
reason to believe that the employee is abusing sick
leave, or has been absent on sick leave for five or
more consecutive work days, or has been absent on sick
leave for an aggregate of more than fifteen (15) days
in a 12 month period.

5. Eligibility for supplemental compensation on
retirement is set forth in 11A:6-16 and
N.J.A.C. 4A:6-3.1 et seq. To the extent legislation
is passed during the term of this agreement amending
entitlement to such supplemental compensation, members
of the unit shall be subject to those legislative
changes in accordance with that legislation

 

139
The FOP contends that its proposal merely codifies the
current practice with regard to sick leave, except that it seeks
to increase the sick leave allotment for detectives in the first
year of their employment from one day a month to 1.25 days per
month.

The State argues sick leave for the unclassified service is

governed by N.J.S.A. 11A:6-16 and N.J.A.C. 4A:6-1.3. N.J.A.C.

 

4A:6-1.3 (Sick Leave), provides, in pertinent part:

(a)Full-time State employees shall be entitled to
annual paid sick leave as set forth in (a)1 and 2
below. 2. 2:

1. New employees shall only receive one working day
for the initial month of employment if they begin work
on the 1st through the 8th day of the calendar month,
and one-half working day if they begin on the 9th
through the 23rd day of the month

2. After the initial month of employment and up to the
end of the first calendar year, employees shall be
credited with one working day for each month of
service. Thereafter, at the beginning of each calendar
year in anticipation of continued employment
employees shall be credited with 15 working days
(Emphasis added)

 

 

 

 

Further, N.J.A.C.4A:6-1.3(g) governs the reasons for which sick

 

leave may be used:

(g) Sick leave may be used by employees who are unable
to work because of:

 

1. Personal illness or injury (see N.J.A.C. 4A:6-21B
for Federal family and medical leave);
2. Exposure to contagious disease (see N 4a: 6-

 

1.21B for Federal family and medical leave);

140
3. Care, for a reasonable period of time, of a
seriously ill member of the employee's immediate
family (see Nu: 4A:1-1.3 for definition of
immediate family, see N.J.A.C. 4A:6-1.21A for family
leave under State law and see N.J C. 4A:6-1.21B for
Federal family and medical leave); or

  

 

 

4. Death in the employee's immediate family, for a
reasonable period of time

Because Sec. B(1) of the Union’s proposal is inconsistent

with (and preempted by) the accrual of sick leave in the first-

 

year of employment mandated by N.J.A.C. 4A:6-1.3(a) (2), it must

be rejected. Conversely, Sec. B(1) and (3) of the State’s
proposal is consistent with the governing Civil Service
regulation. As such, the State’s proposal should be awarded
Proof of Illness:

The State argues that its proposal, which is consistent
with the governing Civil Service regulation, provides:

Proof of illness or injury may be required if there is
reason to believe that the employee is abusing sick
leave, or has been absent on sick leave for five or
more consecutive work days, or has been absent on sick
leave for an aggregate of more than fifteen (15) days
in a 12 month period. (J-9, Item 3.B(4))

The Union has multiple proposals on this subject:

If an Employee cannot work due to an illness, injury
or infirmity, the employee shall be required to
present evidence in the form of a certificate from a
licensed physician that he is unable to work after he
or she is absent from work for five (5) consecutive
work days. The Employer may require the said employee
to present an additional certificate from a physician
of the employer's selection. If the Employer requires
the employee to present an additional certificate from
a physician of the employer's selection, the expense
of obtaining the same will be borne by the employer

 

141
Certifications of infirmity may be continually
requested by the employer at a frequency rate that is
consisted with the rules and regulations of the New

Jersey Family Leave Act, N.J.S.A. 34:11B-1, et. seq.

(J-10, TLem 10.A).

As well as:

4, After an employee has used five (5) continuous

sick days, the employer shall have the right to demand

that the employee furnish a note from his doctor that

the employee was in fact ill. (J-8, Item 11.B(4)

The State argues that the Union offered no evidence or
testimony in support of its proposal to limit the circumstances
in which DCJ may request proof of illness. (J-8, Item 11.B(4)
Nonetheless, the Union’s proposals impermissibly limit the
circumstances under which the State may request proof of illness
from a unit member, and would be in violation of the governing
Civil Service regulation. As such, the Union’s proposal cannot
be awarded. On the other hand, the State’s proposal is taken

directly from the Civil Service regulation and should be

awarded.

 

N.J.A.C.4A:6-1.4(d) (Sick leave procedures: State Service)

 

provides:

An appointing authority may require proof of illness
or injury when there is a reason to believe that an
employee is abusing sick leave; an employee has been
absent on sick leave for five or more consecutive work
days; or an employee has been absent on sick leave for
an aggregate of more than 15 days in a 12-month
period. (S-24)

Additionally, the State’s proposal is consistent with its

SOP 1-00 on “Sick Leave Usage,” (FOP-13), which has been in

142
effect since February 9, 2000. We note that the parties have
stipulated to a Management Rights article which recognizes the
application of the SOPs Lo the unit members. (See J-10, Item §
and J-11, Item 5).

I find that the State’s proposal is based upon the
applicable Civil Service statutes and regulations and therefore
must be awarded. On the other hand, the Union’s proposals
which seek to add additional sick days in the employee's first
year of employment and to limit the Employer’s opportunity to
verify sick leave usage when abuse is suspected, are contrary to
the statute and regulations and are preempted by same. 1 award

the following provisions:

 

Pursuant to N. ~ 11A:6-16 and 4A:6-1.3, et

   

seq
1. _ Employees will earn sick leave at the rate of
one (1) day per month for the first calendar year and
will be credited with fifteen (15) days of sick leave
each year thereafter.

2. Unused sick leave may be carried over to the next
calendar year with no restrictions.

3. Sick leave may be used for
d. Illness;
€. Death of an immediate family member;

f. Care of a seriously ill member of the employee's
immediate family.

4. Proof of Illness

Proof of illness or injury may be required if there is
reason to believe that the employee is abusing sick

143
and religious observances” while N.J.A.C. 4A:6-1.9(a) (1) further

 

provides that the “[p]riority for granting such leave requests
shall be: (i) emergencies; (ii) religious holidays; (iii)
personal matters.” The Union’s proposal is prohibited by the
foregoing regulatory requirements and completely ignores the
operational impact that would result in providing all employees
with three paid days off without any advanced notice or approval
requirements. On the other hand, the State asserts that its
proposal is consistent with the requirements set forth in
N.J.A.C. 4A:6-1.9(a) and (b) while simultaneously providing
additional practical context for the approval process.
Accordingly, the State argues that the Union’s proposal on
Section 3 must be rejected in favor of the State’s proposal

The State further argues that Section 5 of its proposal

should also be awarded as it is consistent with the mandate

 

contained in N 4A:6-1.9(e), which provides:

“Administrative leave that is not used during the calendar year
shall be forfeited.”

I award the following provisions under the administrative
leave clause:

3. Detectives will be permitted to take three days of
annual leave in each calendar year for personal
business, including emergencies and religious
observances. The detectives request for the use of
administrative leave time shall indicate whether the
basis of the request is due to an emergency, the
observance of a religious holiday, or to attend to
personal matters. The request must be approved by the

152

 
DCJ Chief of Staff or his/her designee and shall not
be unreasonably denied.

4. Consistent with N.J.A.C. 4A:6-1.9, priority in
granting such requests shall be (1) emergencies, (2)
religious holidays (3) personal matters.”)

5. There is no accumulation, carry forward, or lump
sum reimbursement for unused administrative leave.

It should be noted that I have rejected the State’s
language requiring advance notice, specific reasons for the
request, and/or documentation to support the request. I believe
that the employee should not be compelled to divulge the
circumstances underlying the employee's need to take an
administrative leave day except to the extent that the
regulation provides for priorities in approving such requests.

TIME OFF FOR ILLNESS, INJURY OR INFIRMITY

 

The Union proposes:

A. If an Employee cannot work due to an illness, injury or
infirmity, the employee shall be required to present
evidence in the form of a certificate from a licensed
physician that he is unable to work after he or she is
absent from work for five (5) consecutive work days. The
Employer may require the said employee to present an
additional certificate from a physician of the employer's
selection. If the Employer requires the employee to present
an additional certificate from a physician of the
employer's selection, the expense of obtaining the same
will be borne by the employer. Certifications of infirmity
may be continually requested by the employer at a frequency
rate that is consisted with the rules and regulations of
the New Jersey Family Leave Act, N.J.S.A. 34:11B-1, et.
seq.

 

The FOP argues in its brief that there is no dispute concerning the
priority of approving administrative leave. However, the State’s proposed
Paragraph 4 did not appear in the FOP’s final offer as agreed upon language.

153
B. For the purpose of this Article, injury or illness
incurred while the employee is acting in any law
enforcement activity in the line of duty shall be

covered by the State’s Workmen's Compensation

Tnsurance Carrier or equivalent.

C. In the event a dispute arises as to whether an

absence shall be designated as an injury on duty, (as

outlined in Section B), the parties agree to be bound

by the decision of an appropriate Workmen's

Compensation Judgment or, if there is an appeal

therefrom, the final decision of the last reviewing

court.

FOP seeks a provision delineating certain procedures to be
adhered to when an employee is ill and/or injured. Initially,
FOP’s proposal addresses the situation wherein an employee is
out of work for more than five days. Detective Donlan indicated
what the proposal is exactly seeking to accomplish:

+ + + There we are stating that if a detective is

taking sick time for more than five days that he has

to come in with a note from a doctor. And if the

State requires him or her to come up with another

note, they can have them see their own doctor, but

have to give them time for that and pay for it.. (1T-

111)

According to Donlan, such a process is currently used by
the Division and contained in Standard Operating Procedure #1-
00, entitled “Sick Leave Usage.” (FOP-13). The Union argues
that this portion of the proposal should be awarded as a matter
of practicality. Simply put, this portion of the proposal is
merely seeking to codify a process already utilized and adhered

to by the Division. Moreover, logic dictates that if the

Division desires the production of a doctor’s note from one of

154
its own physicians, it should be responsible for the cost
associated with the same.

The FOP contends that the next part of FOP’s proposal
merely indicates that any injury and/or illness which is
incurred while a detective is performing the duties and
functions of his/her employment will be covered by workers
compensation. Similar to the maternity leave provision, this
portion of the proposal simply recounts and codifies an
employee’s entitlement to workers’ compensation benefits as
required by law. As such, no comprehensive analysis regarding
the same is necessitated

The Union argues that this proposal is similar to
provisions contained in various law enforcement collective
negotiation agreements and therefore should be awarded. (FOP-19

The first part of the Union’s proposal was addressed in the
Sick Leave Section above. To the extent that the FOP seeks to
have the State reimburse its members for the cost of obtaining a
doctor’s note to document sick leave or unpaid leaves of absence
under FMLA/FLA, I decline to award this part of the Union’s
proposal. These employees are adequately covered with health
care insurance which covers most of the cost of medical visits.

The remaining portion concerning workers’ compensation was

not directly addressed by the State in its brief. I award the

 

following provision for this Articli

155
A, Injury or illness incurred while the employee is
acting in any law enforcement activity in the line of
duty shall be covered by the State’s Workmen's
Compensation Plan.

B. In the event a dispute arises as to whether an

absence shall be designated as an injury on duty, (as

outlined in Section A), the parties agree to be bound

by the decision of an appropriate Workmen's

Compensation Judgment or, if there is an appeal

therefrom, the final decision of the last reviewing

court.
MATERNITY LEAVE

The Union proposes the following clause

Maternity Leave:

Employees shall be entitled to maternity leave

consistent with federal and state laws and regulations

with the most liberal interpretation taking

precedence.

The Union argues that the Division has historically
provided FOP members with such leave when necessitated. (3T-154-
155) FOP seeks formal codification of the same. The Union
avers that the members’ entitlement to maternity leave should be
codified within the collective negotiations agreement as a
matter of practicality, especially given the fact the Division
has provided this benefit for several years. Therefore, the
proposal should be awarded.

The State argues this proposal essentially requires that
the applicable federal and state laws relative to maternity
leave be followed. The parties need not have this provision

inserted into the contract as statutory obligations are

independent of the CNA. Also, Union’s subjective, ambiguous and

156
unexplained language, “with the most liberal interpretation
taking precedence,” is likely to generate unnecessary and
potentially costly grievance and arbitrations. The State is not
aware of, nor has Union cited, to any other contract with
similar language. For the foregoing reasons, the proposal
should not be awarded.

It is not clear to me why the contract should have a
separate provision covering pregnancy disability and child care
leave. Such circumstances are but a small part of the overall
medical leave provisions which are covered by the Federal
Medical Leave Act and the New Jersey Family Leave Act. The
provisions of both the federal statute and the state statute
apply. Therefore, I find that this separate proposed provision
for maternity leave is unnecessary
LEAVE OF ABSENCE WITHOUT PAY:

The FOP proposes:

Employees shall be entitled to apply for a leave of

absence without pay. The application shall set forth

the reason for the request and should be forwarded

through channels to the Chief of Detectives. Leave of

absence without pay for a maximum period of twelve

(12) months shall only be granted under unusual

circumstances where denial would result in extreme

personal hardship and deprival of opportunity for the
requesting employee. Consideration of such requests

shall be weighed against the negative effect of such

leave on Division operations and scheduling. The

decision with regard to the granting or denial of

requests for leave of absence under this Article shall

lie ultimately with the Chief of Detectives.

The State proposes:

157
Consistent with N.J.A.C. 4A:6-1.10, employees shall be

entitled to apply for a leave of absence without pay

The application shall set forth the reason for the

request and should be forwarded through channels to

lhe Chief of Detectives. The decision with regard to

the granting or denial of requests for leave of

absence under this Article shall lie exclusively with

the Attorney General or his/her designee

The Union argues that its proposal is consistent with SOP
#6, which permits detectives to take a leave of absence without
pay for a maximum period of twelve months. (FOP-14) Donlan
further testified that detectives have taken leaves without pay
for a variety of reasons, to include medical care, child birth
as well as attending another police academy

The FOP asserts that its proposal is consistent with
Standard Operating Procedure #6. Donlan indicated it is
important to the FOP to have this SOP codified within the
confines of the collective negotiations agreement as it provides
a useful and important benefit to the detectives and, presently
the same can be changed or eliminated at any time at the desire
of the Division.

The State argues that N.J.A.C.4A:6-1.10 (Leaves Without

 

Pay: State Service) provides that “fe]mployees in the . .
unclassified service may be granted leaves of absence without
pay up to one year, at the discretion of the appointing

authority.” N.J.A.C.4A: 6-1.10(b). Although the parties

proposals are not entirely inconsistent -~ both grant the State

 

158
ultimate discretion to grant or deny the leave request -— only
the State’s proposal identifies and would put unit members on
notice of the reyulalion from which the benefit is derived. ‘he
State asserts that its proposal is consistent with the
regulation in that ultimate authority over the decision to grant
or deny the leave requests rests with the Attorney General (i.e.
the appointing authority) whereas the Union’s proposal vests
that decision in the Chief of Detectives. Thus, to be
consistent with N.J.A.C. 4A: 6-1.10(b), the State’s proposal
should be awarded.

The current SOP #6 in effect for DCJ investigators provides
that investigators wishing an unpaid leave of absence must
submit a written request through the chain of command to the
Chief of State Investigators. Such requests must include the
reason for the leave and the proposed duration. Further, it
provides that the leave of absence may not exceed one year
absent exceptional circumstances. It also provides that the DCJ
Director may grant the unpaid leave of absence with the
Department of Personnel approval.

N.J-A.C. 4A:6-1.10(b) provides “Employees in the senior
executive and unclassified service may be granted leaves of
absence without pay up to one year, at the discretion of the
appointing authority.”

Therefore, it appears that the current SOP is not entirely

consistent with the administrative code. Nevertheless, I agree

159
with the State that the designation of the individual to whom
approval authority must be derived, is a decision best left to
the appointing aulhority. Therefore, I award the following
language to be included in the contract:

Consistent with N.J.A.C. 4A:6-1.10, detectives may
apply for an unpaid leave of absence by submitting a
request through the chain of command to the Chief of
Investigators. The application shall include the
reason for the proposed leave and the proposed
duration. The decision with regard to the granting or
denial of requests for leave of absence under this
Article shall lie exclusively with the Attorney
General or his/her designee. Absent exceptional
circumstances, such leaves of absence shall not extend
beyond one year.

 

HOLIDAYS

The State and FOP agree upon several provisions relating to
holidays. Specifically, the parties agree upon the holidays
which are recognized, when certain holidays are celebrated, and
FOP members being granted a paid day off when the Governor
declares a paid day off by Executive Order. Where the proposals
diverge, however, revolves around three issues: (1) subsequent
amendments to the list of holidays; (2) whether detectives will
be granted time off in the event the Governor grants a partial
day off; and (3) the FOP’s request for double time in the event
a holiday must be worked. The FOP proposes the following
contract provisions:

2. In the event the Governor grants less than a day

off, employees shall be granted an equal number of
hours regardless of the assignment of the employee

160
3. If an employee is required to work on one of the

aforementioned holidays, the employee shall be

compensated at the rate of double time (two (2) times

the normal rate of pay
The State proposes the following language

2. The statutorily prescribed holidays, including any

subsequent amendments thereto, shall be the holidays

recognized for purposes of this Agreement.

The FOP argues that the State’s language pertaining to any
subsequent amendment of the holidays must be rejected. It
argues that, similar to the health insurance language the State
has proposed, an award of this language would allow the
compensation package given to FOP members to be unilaterally
altered during the term of a collective negotiations agreement.
Moreover, such a provision is not contained in any other
comparable State law enforcement collective negotiations
agreements. As a matter of comparability and fairness, the
Union claims that the State’s proposed language should be
rejected.

The FOP maintains that its request for double time
compensation if work is performed on one of the holidays is more
than justified. As stated by Neggia, a comparable provision is
contained in many collective negotiations agreements covering
county prosecutor’s detectives. (3T-158-159) Moreover, working
on a holiday is not normally required of a DCJ detective. Ifa

detective is required to do so, he/she should be compensated

appropriately for engaging in such atypical work

161
The State argues that the designation of holidays for State
employees is preempted by N.J.S.A. 11A:6-24.1, which provides
“Paid holidays granted to ali State government employees each
calendar year shall be limited to the following... .”
N.J.S.A, 11A:6-24.1a. Director Dee explained that the State's
proposal merely clarifies that fact so as not to raise any
conflict or confusion. (47-226) Moreover, the State points out
that identical language to that proposed by the State is
contained in the following State law enforcement contracts: FOP
174, Art. XV, Sec. A; PBA Local 105, Art. XVI, Sec. 1; New
Jersey Law Enforcement Commanding Officers Association, Art. XV
Sec. AL; and New Jersey Law Enforcement Superiors Association
Art. XV, Sec. A. (S-31) The State Police contract also
contains substantially similar language: “the list [of holidays
above shall be modified beginning January 1, 2012 to be
consistent with State law and shall thereafter only be included
for informational purposes as holidays will then be set pursuant
to statute.” (FOP-24, Art. VI, Sec. B(1)).

Further, the State argues that the Union's proposal
concerning the granting of less than a full day off by the
Governor’s executive order must be rejected. Dee clearly and
succinctly stated the State’s rationale for opposing this
proposal:

If the Governor grants less than a day off as it says

in Paragraph [4] above, it's going to be by Executive
Order, as I understand the process, and that Executive

162
Order is going to say who gets off and when and how

the schedules work, so the contract should not and

cannot change that, so we don't want that in there

that's why we are not agreeable to that

Finally, the State argues that the Union has presented no
evidence in support of its proposal that detectives who work a
holiday be compensated at twice their regular rate of pay.

Civil Service regulations already provide that the tens of
thousands of State employees covered by the regulations who work
on a holiday receive time and one-half in addition to the
holiday pay. See N.J.A.C. 4A: 3-5.8. The State argues that the
Union has presented no evidence to warrant that they be treated
any differently.

I am inclined to reject the Union’s proposal concerning
subsequent modifications of the holiday schedule. First, the
identification of which holidays are days off for State
employees is established by State statute. This statutory
language appears to preempt negotiations. Second, contrary to
the Union's assertion, the State’s language proposed herein was
included in the interest arbitration award in the matter of

State of New Jersey v. New Jersey Law Enforcement Superior

 

Officers Association, J. Mastriani (1/21/14), aff'd State/LESA
P.E.R.C. No. 2014-60, __ NJPER __(4_—= 2014), appeal

pending. In addition, the same contract language also appears
in contracts between the State and PBA Local 105 and FOP Lodge

174. As noted above, the pattern of bargaining on this issue

163
has already been established. Therefore, the language as
proposed by the State in Section 2 is awarded

I am also not inclined to award the FOP’s proposal
concerning partial days off as declared by executive order. In
these instances, the content of the executive order will
control. There is no need for additional and potentially
conflicting language in the contract on this issue.

Finally, the Union proposes to be paid double time for
hours worked on a holiday. The record shows that there have
been occasions when detectives have been required to work on
State-declared holidays. However, the Union is correct that
such work is not part of their typical work schedule. It is
noted that typically law enforcement officers may be required to
give up their holiday off because of operational demands. In
such situations the employee does not have the benefit of the
holiday off to spend time with family and engage in leisure
pursuits. The employee should be appropriately compensated for
surrendering such time off to the needs of the State
Therefore, I award a modified version of the Union’s proposal to
read as follows:

3. If an employee is required to work on one of the

aforementioned holidays, the employee shall be

compensated at the rate of one and a half times the

normal rate of pay.

UNION LEAVE TIME

164
The parties have submitted competing proposals regarding
union leave. The State has proposed to provide detectives with
20 days of union Leave per year, without pay. Additionally, the
State’s proposal would not permit detectives to carryover any
unused leave days into successive years. Conversely, FOP
proposes 35 days of union leave per year, with pay, in addition
to 35 unpaid leave days. Moreover, FOP proposal would allow the
carryover of unused days. Finally, under the terms of the FOP’s
proposal, the leave would be retroactive to January 1, 2014.

FOP proposes the following provisions for Union Leave Tim

 

B. Leave Time

1. Officers and/or members of the Executive Board (or
designees) of the Negotiations Unit shall be granted a
total of one thirty five (35) days per year leave effective
January 1, 2014, not to be deducted from their duty leave
or vacation, to pursue the affairs of the Negotiations
Unit. In addition, thirty five (35) days per year leave
without pay per year shall be granted.

2. The allocation of such leave among the Officers and
members of the Executive Board shall be determined solely
by the Negotiations Unit.

3. Union leave days which are not utilized in one (1)
contract year may be carried forward for use in the next
contract year.

4, The Negotiations Unit may be advanced a maximum of
twenty (20) paid leave days in any contract year, in which
the provided thirty five (35) days per year have been
exhausted. Any paid leave days so advanced will then be
deducted from the number of paid leave days normally
creditable in the next contract year. Approval of requests
for advances of such leave time shall not be unreasonably
withheld.

B. Leave Time to Attend to Lodge Business

165
1. Officers and/or members of the Executive Board of
the Lodge shall be granted a total of twenty (20) days
of leave without pay per each year of this Agreement
effective January 1, 2015, not to be deducted from
their duty leave or vacation, to attend to Loage
business. This leave is to be used exclusively for
Lodge activities for which appropriate approval by the
State is required. Such approval will not be
unreasonably withheld

2. The allocation of such leave among the Officers and

members of the Executive Board shall be determined

solely by the Bargaining unit

3. Union leave days which are not utilized in one (1)

contract year may not be carried forward for use in

the next contract year.

4. Application for the use of such leave on behalf of

the officers of the Officers and members of the

Executive Board shall be made in writing fourteen (14)

days in advance by the Lodge President to the Office

of Employee Relations.

5. Timely requests for such leave will be approved

based upon the condition that the employee's absence

will not cause undue hardship or the inability of the

work unit to function effectively

The Union argues the State’s proposal is abhorrent. By
proposing 20 days of unpaid leave, the Union argues that the
State’s proposal would deny it a benefit provided to every other
State law enforcement collective negotiations unit, namely paid
union leave days in addition to unpaid union leave days. The
Union continues that paid union leave is necessary to: (1)
administer the business of the union; and (2) address situations
involving detectives as they arise. As a matter of

comparability and fairness, the State’s proposal should be

rejected.

166
Further, the Union maintains that the State’s proposal
fails to recognize FOP’s negotiating committee was forced to use
their own personal time to attend the interest arbitration
hearings and pre-arbitration mediation sessions in this matter
The State’s proposal fails to reimburse the negotiating
committee for the time they already utilized. From a labor
relations standpoint, this is patently unacceptable.

The FOP contends that its proposal regarding union leave is
fair and equitable based upon all the relevant evidence. The
proposal recognizes that Lodge 91 members are assigned
throughout the State. Detectives are assigned to the following
locations: (1) Whippany; (2) Trenton; (3) Cherry Hill; and (4
Atlantic City. This makes contacting certain members and/or
addressing certain issues somewhat problematic. The union
leave, as requested, would help alleviate this burden.

Finally, the FOP avers that the amount of union leave it
requests is reasonable. Neggia testified that the amount of

leave the FOP is requesting is in direct proportion to the

 

amount currently afforded to the STFA:
Q. The Union is asking for 35 days per year for Union
leave to take care of Union affairs. where did the
Union come up with this number?

A. This number was basically derived from looking at
numerous contracts throughout the County Prosecutors
and State law enforcement. What we came upon with was
the STFA, which is the State Police Fraternal
Association, and at the time that we reviewed this
contract there were approximately 1,300 members that
were covered by this Collective Bargaining Agreement

167
and STFA were granted 325 days for Union time. We

simply took a ratio of the Detectives in our

bargaining unit which is approximately 136. We simply

came up with an equivalent ratio based on that, which

is 35 days. [3T-163]

The FOP contends that its proposal for union leave is
comparable to the union leave provisions of comparable
collective negotiations units. The FOP argues that its proposal
should be awarded considering all the relevant facts and
circumstances.

The State acknowledges that its proposal to allot the Union
leadership 20 days of unpaid leave represents a change in policy
regarding the spending of public funds for employees to conduct
business that does not benefit the State. The shift in policy
arose in response to a State Commission of Investigation (“SCI”)
report that criticized the State and municipalities for granting
paid time off for union leave because of its attendant costs to
taxpayers. Dee testified that in the last negotiations cycle
the State “rolled back” paid union leave from 9% to as high as
26% for all units. (4T-152-53) As Arbitrator Mastriani stated
in his award reducing the number of leave days for the
Corrections Sergeants in NJLESA:

I do not award NJLESA's proposal to expand the number

of leave days to attend Association activities from 195

to 225. There is a clear trend in all of the

comparable law enforcement units to reduce the number

of days of union leave as evidenced by the recent

reductions in all of the various contracts.

Notwithstanding this, NJLESA has provided testimony

and extensive argument differentiating its need for
leave time from the other units. The reductions that

168
have taken place do not appear to stem from a lack of
usefulness of the leave days but are reflective of a
policy understanding as to State funding of the
benefit.

 

 

 

State of NJ and NJ Law Enf. Super. Assoc., PERC Docket No. IA-

 

2014-003 (Mastriani) at p. 91. The State points out that the
recently negotiated contract with the new unit of Deputy
Attorneys General provided for no paid union leave.

The State contends that the remainder of its language in
the Union Leave clause is typical contract language required for
the orderly implementation of the leave provision.

I recognize that there is a State-wide trend to scale back
on paid leave for employees to attend to union business. In

State of New Jersey and NJLESA, Arbitrator Mastriani declined

 

the Union’s demand to increase union leave time and partly
granted the State’s proposal to reduce union leave -- from 195
days annually to 175 days annually. It must be noted that that
bargaining unit is much larger and more diverse than the DCJ
unit. In fact, the ratio developed by FOP to formulate its
proposed allotment of union leave days was predicated upon the
STFA contract, which was negotiated in September 2011, well
before the scale-back on union leave time got underway.

Of course, because this is a newly certified unit, there is
no history to be able to discern the frequency of grievance
filings, so it is difficult to determine how much time is

adequate for the union to administer its new contract. In

169
palancing the Union's need for sufficient time off to administer
the contract and the State’s need for detectives on the clock to
be duty, I award the following:

1. Members of the Executive Board, or designees of the
Lodge 91, shall be granted a total of 24 days per year paid
leave effective July 1, 2014, not to be deducted from their
contractual leave time, to pursue the affairs of Lodge 91
In addition, 12 days per year leave without pay shall be
granted.

2. The allocation of such leave among the members of the
Executive Board or their designees shall be determined
solely by Lodge 91.

3. Union leave days which are not utilized in one contract
year may not be carried forward for use in the next
contract year.

4. Application for the use of such leave on behalf of
members of the Executive Board or their designee shall be
made in writing ten calendar days in advance by the Lodge
President to the Office of Employee Relations.

5. Timely requests for such leave will be approved based
upon the condition that the employee's absence will not
cause undue hardship or the inability of the work unit to
function effectively.

SUPER-SENIORITY:
The Union proposes the following

It is recognized that Executive Board members and field
office representatives of the Negotiations Unit have a need
for continuity in their assigned locations which exceeds
that of other employees. It is, therefore, agreed that:

1. Field Office representatives of the Negotiations Unit
will not, subject to the overriding operational
requirements of the Division, be routinely transferred
involuntarily.

2. Executive Board members will not be involuntarily
transferred from the Hughes Justice Complex or field
office, and Bureau, to which they are assigned when named
to that office for the term of office, providing such

170
retention may be interrupted if emergency conditions
warrant.

The Union contends that this clause is necessary to prevent
its leadership from being transferred to another location. This
would maintain the existing Union representation structure at
all facilities.

While the State recognizes that limited controls over the
“regular” involuntary transfers of union officers may be
negotiable, see Local 195, supra, 88 N.J. at 423, the State
asserts that the Union’s proposals to limit the DCJ’s managerial
prerogative to transfer union officers except in “emergency
conditions” is far beyond the limits of negotiability recognized
in Local 195. Moreover, the State argues that the Union failed
to present any evidence at the hearing that the transfer of
union officers has posed any impact on the officers’ ability to
represent employees in the bargaining unit in the past and
thus, has failed to satisfy its burden of establishing a basis
for the award of this proposal.

1 decline to award the Union’s proposal limiting transfers
of its Union leadership. The Union has not demonstrated that
such transfers have occurred or that there has been any
targeting of its Union leadership for transfers. Therefore, I
find that this proposal has not been justified and I decline to

award it.

171
TRAINING AND CONTINUING PROFESSIONAL EDUCATION:

 

The FOP proposes the following:

A. The State recognizes the need to have sworn, law
enforcement personnel in the Division of Criminal Justice
with advanced degrees and/or professional licenses in
varying disciplines, which includes, but is not limited to,
certified public accountancy, law, environmental sciences,
insurance and finance.

1. The State acknowledges its responsibility to train
Division of Criminal Justice investigators so they have the
degree of technical training and proficiency necessary to
complete the complex criminal investigations conducted by
the Division of Criminal Justice

2. Therefore, the State will work to recruit, employ,
train and retain a sufficient cadre of duly sworn, Division
of Criminal Justice investigative personnel with such
technical training, proficiency and advanced degrees and/or
professional licenses to successfully conduct the
Division’s work.

3. To those ends, the State will:

(a) Allow and/or provide Division of Criminal Justice
investigative personnel access to attend and successfully
complete the necessary continuing professional education
credits, in a timely manner, so they may keep their
professional status in good standing with the issuing
agency or entity. When a member attends outside training
for purposes of maintaining a license, the State will fund
all expenses associated with the same.

(b) Allow Division of Criminal Justice investigative
personnel to use work hours, as well as, State resources
and equipment to travel to/from and to attend these
training programs.

(c) Pay the cost of each continuing professional education
program or reimburse Division of Criminal Justice
investigative personnel, so there shall be no out of pocket
expense to the employee.

4, Selection of the continuing professional programs shall
be made as to comply with the required regulations of the
issuing agency. Selection of an individual course will be
at the discretion of the license holder. Any program

172
selected under this section must earn the licensee with

continuing training hours/credits to be eligible for

reimbursement or direct payment.

The FOP argues that this proposal is intended to provide
payment for training and compensation while attending the
training and earning professional education credits associated
therewith. The FOP asks that the Employer fund these costs
given they are reaping an enormous benefit from detectives
possessing a higher level of education

Neggia testified that a bachelor’s degree is a requirement
of the detectives and that the Division frequently seeks
individuals with advanced degrees and/or professional licenses
for its employ. The FOP maintains that, with regard to many of
these licenses and/or certifications detectives hold, there are
continuing education requirements to maintain the same. The FOP
argues that since the Division is receiving the benefits of
these licenses and/or certifications, it should bear the cost
associated to maintain the same. In fact, it is akin to the
Division paying for the deputy attorneys general client
protection fund annual assessment every year, a requirement to
maintain active status as an attorney. (3T-162-163) The Union
argues that its proposal is logical and pragmatic and therefore,
should be awarded.

The State contends that the FOP’s proposal is already

covered by the Department of Law and Public Safety’s Tuition

173
Reimbursement Program. The Program, as memorialized in SOP 2-
95, (S-27), has been in place since February 13, 1995 pursuant
to N.J.A.C. 4:A6-4.6. (S-28) The regulation requires that “each

State department or agency, subject to available appropriations

 

shall establish a tuition aid program” to assist employees with
the cost of post-secondary education. N.J.A.C. 4:A6-4.6(a). The

State notes that the program is still in effect, but simply has

 

not been funded in these difficult economic times

It is the State’s position that SOP 2-95 should be left to
govern this subject. The SOP contains important provisions not
found in Union’s proposal, such as: a requirement that an
employee be employed in a full-time position for one-year before
being eligible for the benefit; a requirement that an employee
who terminates employment within one-year from completing a
course must refund the Division for 100% of the tuition
reimbursement; and reimbursement for “continuing education
courses related to required professional certifications.” The
latter requirement would cover the Union's proposal. As SOP 2-
95 continues to apply to all employees in the Department of Law
and Public Safety and not just its detectives, the SOP should be
left in place and Union’s proposals rejected.

The State notes that, other than the State Police contract
from which the FOP lifted its proposal language, every other
State law enforcement agreement that has a Tuition and Employee

Training Article contains the identical language in that

174
article: “fhe tuition aid program shall be administered

 

consistent with N.J.A.C. 4A:6-4.6.” (See S-31: FOP 174, Art.
XXXIV; PBA Local 105, Art. XL; NJ SLEU; NJ Sup. Off. Law. Enf.
Assoc., Art. XL; and Art. XXXVIII). Therefore, the State argues
that if any language should be awarded on this subject, it is:
“The tuition aid program shall be administered consistent with
N.J.A.C. 4A:6-4.6.”

The Division’s SOP 2-95, issued in 1995, provides at
section IV(D):

Continuing education courses related to required

professional certification, which are a direct

requirement of the employee’s current job

responsibilities, may be considered for reimbursement

if funds are available. Reimbursement amounts will be

consistent with the established tuition policy
The FOP’s proposal for continuing education necessary to
maintain a license includes (a) a guarantee that the State will
bear the cost of the course or seminar, including travel
expenses; (b) time off with pay; (c) a State car for travel to
the course; and (d) the employee’s ability to select the course.
The proposed language is not contingent upon funding being
available.

The Union’s theory is that the Division benefits from
having licensed professionals such as CPA’s and attorneys on its
staff. Since maintaining such licenses requires the licensee to

periodically take continuing education courses as a condition of

the license, I understand the Union’s argument that the Division
should contribute to the cost of obtaining the course credits.
But my first problem with FOP’s proposal is that I am unable to
even estimate Lhe cost of this proposal to the Division.

Second, the Division should be permitted to have input into the
selection of the course so that it can ensure that the course is
related to the employee’s area of responsibility the extent
possible. I award the following

1. The State will allow Division of Criminal Justice
detectives to attend and successfully complete the
necessary continuing professional education credits, in a
timely manner, so they may keep their professional status
in good standing with the issuing agency or entity

2. The State will permit Division of Criminal Justice
detectives time off with pay to attend these training
programs.

3. Continuing education courses related to required
professional certification, which are a direct
requirement of the employee's current job
responsibilities, may be considered for reimbursement
if funds are available. Reimbursement amounts will be
consistent with the established tuition policy

4, Selection of the continuing professional programs shall
be made as to comply with the required regulations of the
issuing agency. Selection of the individual training
course will be at the discretion of the license holder but
subject to the approval of the Division. Any program
selected under this section must earn the licensee
continuing training hours/credits to be eligible for
reimbursement or direct payment.

UNIFORMS
The parties have submitted competing proposals with regard
to uniforms. The FOP proposes

Clothing/Equipment allowance shall be paid at the rate
of one thousand dollars ($1,000.00) annually, which

176
shall be paid in a lump sum commencing with the first
pay period of each calendar year

The State proposes:

The State agrees to continue its current practice of

providing initial issue of uniforms to all new

employees in this unit and to replace worn or damaged

uniforms as necessary

The FOP argues that its request for a $1,000 annual payment
would allow detectives to purchase and/or replace certain
clothing items and equipment associated with their employment.
Currently, members are responsible for purchasing and/or
replacing any uniform or other clothing and equipment items
required to carry out the duties and functions of their
employment. As testified to by Neggia, such an allowance is
necessitated given all the scenarios in which detectives
uniforms and/other items become damaged or destroyed. (3T-141-
144). To this end, Neggia indicated many detectives have had to
replace several items throughout the duration of their
employment, with the cost of the same being borne by the
detective. Moreover, he stated that there is no current policy
utilized by the Division in regard to replacing uniforms or
other items that may become damaged during the course of
employment.

Additionally, the FOP notes that almost every other law
enforcement collective negotiations unit throughout the State
receives some sort of clothing/equipment allowance. (FOP-18-21-

22). Of particular note, the SIA receives a clothing allowance

117
of $900 per year in addition to a generous maintenance
allowance. Without a clothing/equipment allowance, the FOP
contends that its members will continue to be forced to spend
their own money for items associated with their employment. *

The State argues that its proposal on uniforms should be
awarded, and the Union’s proposal on a clothing and equipment
allowance should be rejected. First, it points out that
detectives do not have a formal dress code or uniform policy.
(47-69) Chief-of-Staff Miller confirmed this, testifying that
detectives normally wear dress pants, a polo or long-sleeve
shirt, and occasionally jeans during the workday. (47-70

Upon hire, detectives are issued a class B uniform which
consists of cargo pants, four shirts (both long-sleeve and short
sleeve with a “police” emblem or patch on the breast pockets), a
three-season jacket, and an all-weather jacket with the word
“police” printed across the back. Pursuant to the Division’s
SOP, Class B uniform items are replaced when “they are worn

“23 Replacement needs should not

damaged, or they no longer fit
arise frequently because, as Chief Morris testified, detectives
wear their class B uniforms only between five and eight times
each year. (4T-122-123).

The State notes that the Union’s proposed annual $1,000

clothing and equipment allowance which would cost the State

 

2 pet. Neggia testified that he “[didn’t] believe there is an official policy
[for replacing items] I guess theoretically you can request througn the chain
of command for replacement of certain goods. . . .” (3T-143-44

178
approximately $540,000 over the life of the Agreement ($1,000 x
135 Detectives x 4 yrs. = $540,000) — primarily to address the
issue of wet boots and soiled clothes.

The State argues that the Union also seeks this additional
benefit for “equipment.” However, Union provided no evidence as
to what equipment items the State issues to detectives, or what
equipment items detectives believe they need to perform their
duties. Nor has Union provided any evidence as to the cost
associated with purchasing, maintaining or replacing that
equipment at issue, whatever that equipment may be. Critically
the State argues that the Union failed to introduce any credible
evidence regarding actual costs expended by members of the unit
to justify this significant economic benefit. Thus, the Union's
$1,000 per detective annual clothing and equipment allowance is
baseless.

The State’s also observes that its proposal is consistent
with the language contained in its other law enforcement
contracts: “No allowance will be paid to employees who are not
required to purchase a uniform and wear it for work.”*? The
State Police contract provides State troopers with either a $900
or $800 “Clothing Allowance.” See FOP-24, Art. X, Sec. B(9).

However, as Chief Morris, stated, troopers are required to wear

  

8-31 (FOP Lodge 174, Art. XIII, Sec. C; PBA Lodge 105, Art. XXXVIII; NU
rticers Law Ent. Assoc., Art. XXXVI; NJ Law Ent. Commanding Off.
Assoc., Art. XXXII; and PBA SLEU, Art. XXXIX).

179
a full uniform for work and they must maintain their uniforms
for the duration of their service. (4T-122-23)

Dee Leslified Lhal Le Slale’s position is due in pact Lo
an April 13, 2011 report issued by the State Comptroller’s
Office titled, “An Analysis of Clothing Allowance Payments to
White-Collar New Jersey State Employees.” (S-18); (4T-150-51
In the report, the Comptroller recommended that “at a minimum
the State seek to eliminate the clothing allowance benefit for
those employees who are not required to wear uniforms or other
special clothing.”

Finally, the State contends that a review of the Union’s
own fringe benefit survey chart, (FOP-11), shows that fifteen of
New Jersey’s twenty-one counties pay no clothing allowance.
Also, five of the six counties that do pay a clothing allowance
pay substantially less than the $1,000 proposed by Union. The
State argues that the Union failed to present any evidence that
DCJ’s uniform policy is more analogous to any one of the
minority jurisdictions that receive a bonus compared with the
majority that do not.

I intend to award sufficient compensation to partially
defray the cost to detectives for purchasing replacement uniform
components and other equipment necessary in the performance of
their duties. Given their particular line of work, damage to
clothing, shoes, and gear is not an incidental expense.

Employees should not have to pay for the equipment needed to do

180
their job no more than clerks should have to buy their own
staplers. I award the following:

Effective January 1, 2015, an allowance for clothing
and equipment shall be paid to each eligible detective
at the rate of three hundred dollars ($300) annually
which shall be paid in a lump sum commencing with the
first pay period of each calendar year. Detectives
will be expected to maintain and update their own
uniform as needed. The State will no longer be
required to replace damaged or worn uniform
components.

The cost to the State for this benefit will be $40,500
annually.
VEHICLE ASSIGNMENT

The FOP proposes a clause which would provide,

2. All employees serving in the title of Detective will be
individually assigned a state owned or leased vehicle which
will be available for work use only, but may be utilized by
Detectives in an around the clock basis for those members
assigned special assignments including, but not limited to,
the Attorney General’s Shooting Response Team and the High
Risk Team, or at the Chief of Detectives’ discretion.

The State argues that it has a managerial prerogative to
prohibit or limit the use of its vehicles for employee
commutation” and to “deploy its vehicles as it sees fit.”
Morris County Park Commission, P.E.R.C. No. 83-31, 8 NJPER 561,
at 562 (1982), aff'd App. Div. Dkt. No. A-795-82T2 (1984), 10
NJPER 103 (1984), certif. den. 97 N.J. 672 (1984). In New

Jersey Highway Auth. (Garden State Parkway), H.E. No. 93-13, 19

 

NIPER P24, 089, 1993 NJ PERC LEXIS 224 (1993), the Commission
applying Morris County, concluded that the union “cannot
negotiate over the assignment of Authority vehicles,

particularly for commuting purposes.” Hence, the State is not

181
obligated to negotiate over the decision to assign individual
vehicles to its detectives as doing so would impermissibly
infringe upon the State’s managerial prerogative. Accordingly,
the State argues that this proposal may not be awarded.

I agree with the State that the assignment of vehicles is a
non-negotiable managerial prerogative. Therefore, this proposal
cannot be legally awarded. The proposal is denied
NEGOTIATIONS UNIT RIGHTS

The FOP proposes:

1. Where a problem occurs which is of such consequence

as to suggest the need for a higher than institutional

level Negotiations Unit representative, a request to

permit the Negotiations Unit President or his designee
access to the location of the problem may be directed

in writing to the Office of Employee Relations for

approval. A decision and any conditions imposed by the

Office of Employee Relations shall be final. Approval

of such requests shall not be unreasonably withheld.

Under the terms of FOP’s proposal, when such a problem
occurs and/or allegations are made, the President, or his/her
designee, is to be provided access to the location of the
incident and/or involved members, subject to the approval of the
Office of Employee Relations. The proposal indicates that such
approval shall not be unreasonably withheld.

The FOP argues that its proposal is simple and
straightforward. Further, the decision and any conditions
imposed by the Office of Employee Relations shall be final. As

such, any concerns the State has and/or may have regarding this

proposal have been taken into consideration. Finally, given

182
that the decision of Office of Employee Relations will be final,
the sentence indicating that such approval “shall not be
unreasonably withheld” is necessitated to censure such requests
are not denied without adequate justification. (11-98

The State argues that the agreed upon provisions for access
with 72-hours’ notice is sufficient and therefore, this clause
is unnecessary.

I find the proposal is reasonable in that it will allow the
Union to represent its members with difficult and consequential
issues and allows the State to retain control of its premises
through the finality of the decision of the OER. The proposal
is awarded.

Intranet

The Union proposes:

5. Each department/agency of the State that employs members

of the Negotiations Unit may, in its discretion, provide

Negotiations Unit representatives with access to an

intranet page that shall serve as an electronic bulletin

board to be used exclusively by the Negotiations Unit. Use
of this intranet page shall be subject to all restrictions
and requirements under this section

Again, the State does not argue against this. This proposal is

awarded.

Finally, under this Article, the FOP propose:

 

D. Telephone

A telephone shall be available at the Division of
Criminal Justice Headquarters and each field office
for use by the Negotiations Unit representatives for
Negotiations Unit business. This telephone shall be
located within the Negotiations Unit office designed

183
above. The Negotiations Unit shall reimburse the State
for actual telephone charges, if any

The FOP argues that this proposal would allow FOP to be in
communication with its membership, who are scattered among the
State in various locations, its attorney, and/or any other
individual as a situation may warrant. (11-99

The FOP argues that is proposal clearly delineates that it
would be responsible for any charges associated with the use of
the telephone. In other words, the State would merely have to
dedicate one line at each office for use by the FOP
representatives. To this end, the same can be placed in any
office space that is provided for the FOP’s use. The FOP argues
that this proposal would not cause the State to incur any
expenses.

The State maintains that the Union abandoned its proposal
for its own offices and instead agreed to available storage
space for its papers and files. So, essentially what the Union
is asking for is to have telephones located on a file cabinet
that may or may not be available in each of the DCJ’s three
offices.

Donlan testified that the reception on his personal cell
phone is poor at the Whippany field office and that he needs to
exit the building in order to use his cell phone for personal

calls.

184
First, the State argues that it has agreed to provide the
Union with its own page on the DCJ’s intranet through which the
Union may communicate with its members. There is nothing in
the record to indicate that the Union’s representatives have had
any difficulty whatsoever in communicating with their membership
over the past four years

The State avers that not only is the Union’s telephone
Proposal unnecessary, it is cost prohibitive. DOJ Chief-of-
Staff Miller looked into complying with the Union’s proposal
She discovered that the telephone systems in the Whippany and
Cherry Hill offices, and quite possibly the system in the Hughes
Justice Complex in Trenton, are all at maximum capacity. (5T-61-
62)*° To add an additional telephone line would require the
installation of an entire new bank of lines in each office at a
cost of approximately $7,000 for each field office, or $21,000
total. As such, the Union’s proposal should be rejected.

I understand the Union's need to occasionally speak with
their members by phone during work hours. Its ability to do so
is compromised in at least the Whippany office as cell phone
reception is poor in that facility. I also understand the
State’s reluctance to expend resources to expand the telephone
line system at each facility to accommodate an additional

telephone line for the Union. However, the record evidence

 

* miller testified that there may be unoccupied DAG offices with telephones
at the DOJ’s Trenton office, but that those lines are dedicated to those
offices which will be occupied by DAGs with their own extensions. (5T-89-91)

185
reveals that at some locations, there are unassigned “empty”
desks with telephone lines. Therefore, I award the following

To the extent possible, the State will permit the
Union to have a dedicated telephone line in the DCJ
offices in Whippany, Hughes Justice Complex, and
Cherry Hill. The Union will pay for the cost of line
installation, the telephone instrument and any on-
going charges to maintain the line.

DISCIPLINE
The Union proposes,

A. Discipline under this Article means official
written reprimand, fine, suspension without pay
reduction in grade or dismissal from service, based
upon the personal conduct or performance of the
involved employee. Dismissal from service or reduction
in grade based upon a layoff or operational charges
made by the State shall not be construed to be
discipline.

B. Just cause for discipline up to and including
dismissal from service shall include those causes set
forth in N.J.A.C. 4A:2-2.3. The list of causes set
forth in N.J.A.C. 4A:2-2.3 is not exclusive and
discipline up to and including dismissal from service
may be made for any other combination of circumstances
amounting to just cause.

 

C. Where the appointing authority or its designee
imposes discipline pursuant to paragraph B., written
notice of such discipline shall be given to the
employee. Such notice shall contain a reasonable
specification of the nature of the charge, a general
description of the alleged acts and/or conduct upon
which the charge is based and the nature of the
discipline. Suspensions will not be implemented before
the expiration of a period of seventy-two (72) hours
from the beginning of the work shift during which the
notice of suspension was given except in cases where
in the judgment of management, the suspension is
directed at an immediate need to maintain safety
order or effective direction of work assignments.

D. The name of any employee who is notified of
suspension or dismissal pursuant to paragraph C. shall

186
be transmitted to the Negotiations Unit as soon as
feasible but not to exceed seventy-two (72) hours
after such notice.

Any appeal relating to the involved disciplinary
matter must be filed by the employee within fifteen
(15) calendar days of notice of discipline to the
employee involved, and the employee must indicate
within the notice of appeal if he will exercise his
right to a Departmental Disciplinary Hearing. The
employee may be represented at such hearing by a
Negotiations Unit representative in the same work unit
and/or legal counsel. The employee shall have the
right to present evidence and witness at such hearing
as well as cross-examine any witnesses or evidence
presented by the State. The circumstances surrounding
a discipline case may suggest that the Negotiations
Unit President or a member of the Unit's Executive
Board has a particular need to assist in the
presentation at the hearing. He/she may make a request
to do so to the Office of Employee Relations. Such
request shall not be unreasonably denied. The
Department or Agency Head, or his designee, shall
render a written decision within twenty (20) calendar
days from the date of such hearing. The decision
rendered herein shall be final except where the
disciplinary appeal involves a penalty as set forth in
paragraph E. below.

E. In the event the appeal has not been
satisfactorily settled or otherwise resolved and
involves the following contemplated or implemented
penalties:

1. | Suspension of more than five (5) days at one
time;
2. Suspensions or fines more than three (3) days or

for an aggregate of more than fifteen (15) days in one
(1) calendar year; or

Demotion; then

(a) The Negotiations Unit may appeal the discipline
through the disciplinary arbitration process as herein
provided. To file a timely appeal under the
disciplinary arbitration process the Negotiations Unit
must take the following action:

187
a full uniform for work and they must maintain their uniforms
for the duration of their service. (4T-122-23)

Dee testified that the State’s position is due in part to

an April 13, 2011 report issued by the State Comptroller's
Office titled, “An Analysis of Clothing Allowance Payments to
White-Collar New Jersey State Employees.” (S-18); (4T-150-51)
In the report, the Comptroller recommended that “at a minimum
the State seek to eliminate the clothing allowance benefit for
those employees who are not required to wear uniforms or other
special clothing.”

Finally, the State contends that a review of the Union's
own fringe benefit survey chart, (FOP-11), shows that fifteen of
New Jersey's twenty-one counties pay no clothing allowance.
Also, five of the six counties that do pay a clothing allowance
pay substantially less than the $1,000 proposed by Union. The
State argues that the Union failed to present any evidence that
DCJ’s uniform policy is more analogous to any one of the
minority jurisdictions that receive a bonus compared with the
majority that do not.

I intend to award sufficient compensation to partially
defray the cost to detectives for purchasing replacement uniform
components and other equipment necessary in the performance of
their duties. Given their particular line of work, damage to
clothing, shoes, and gear is not an incidental expense

Employees should not have to pay for the equipment needed to do

180
their job no more than clerks should have to buy their own
staplers. I award the following

Effective January 1, 2015, an allowance for clothing
and equipment shall be paid to each eligible detective
at the rate of three hundred dollars ($300) annually,
which shall be paid in a lump sum commencing with the
first pay period of each calendar year. Detectives
will be expected to maintain and update their own
uniform as needed. The State will no longer be
required to replace damaged or worn uniform
components.

The cost to the State for this benefit will be $40,500
annually.
VEHICLE ASSIGNMENT

The FOP proposes a clause which would provide,

2. All employees serving in the title of Detective will be
individually assigned a state owned or leased vehicle which
will be available for work use only, but may be utilized by
Detectives in an around the clock basis for those members
assigned special assignments including, but not limited to,
the Attorney General's Shooting Response Team and the High
Risk Team, or at the Chief of Detectives’ discretion

The State argues that it has a managerial prerogative to
prohibit or limit the use of its vehicles for employee
commutation” and to “deploy its vehicles as it sees fit.”
Morris County Park Commission, P.E.R.C. No. 83-31, 8 NUPER 561
at 562 (1982), aff'd App. Div. Dkt. No. A-795-82T2 (1984), 10
NUPER 103 (1984), certif. den. 97 N.J. 672 (1984). In New

Jersey Highway Auth. (Garden State Parkway), H.E. No. 93-13, 19

 

NIPER P24,089, 1993 NJ PERC LEXIS 224 (1993), the Commission,
applying Morris County, concluded that the union “cannot
negotiate over the assignment of Authority vehicles

particularly for commuting purposes.” Hence, the State is not

181
obligated to negotiate over the decision to assign individual
vehicles to its detectives as doing so would impermissibly
infringe upon the State’s managerial prerogative. Accordingly
the State argues that this proposal may not be awarded.

I agree with the State that the assignment of vehicles is a
non-negotiable managerial prerogative. Therefore, this proposal
cannot be legally awarded. The proposal is denied
NEGOTIATIONS UNIT RIGHTS

The FOP proposes:

1. Where a problem occurs which is of such consequence

as to suggest the need for a higher than institutional

level Negotiations Unit representative, a request to

permit the Negotiations Unit President or his designee
access to the location of the problem may be directed

in writing to the Office of Employee Relations for

approval. A decision and any conditions imposed by the

Office of Employee Relations shall be final. Approval

of such requests shall not be unreasonably withheld.

Under the terms of FOP’s proposal, when such a problem
occurs and/or allegations are made, the President, or his/her
designee, is to be provided access to the location of the
incident and/or involved members, subject to the approval of the
Office of Employee Relations. The proposal indicates that such
approval shall not be unreasonably withheld

The FOP argues that its proposal is simple and
straightforward. Further, the decision and any conditions
imposed by the Office of Employee Relations shall be final. As

such, any concerns the State has and/or may have regarding this

proposal have been taken into consideration. Finally, given

182
that the decision of Office of Employee Relations will be final,
the sentence indicating that such approval “shall not be
unreasonably withheld” is necessitated to ensure such requests
are not denied without adequate justification. (11-98

The State argues that the agreed upon provisions for access
with 72-hours’ notice is sufficient and therefore, this clause
is unnecessary.

I find the proposal is reasonable in that it will allow the
Union to represent its members with difficult and consequential
issues and allows the State to retain control of its premises
through the finality of the decision of the OER. The proposal
is awarded.

Intranet

The Union proposes:

5. Each department/agency of the State that employs members

of the Negotiations Unit may, in its discretion, provide

Negotiations Unit representatives with access to an

intranet page that shall serve as an electronic bulletin

board to be used exclusively by the Negotiations Unit. Use
of this intranet page shall be subject to all restrictions
and requirements under this section.
Again, the State does not argue against this. This proposal is
awarded.
Finally, under this Article, the FOP proposes:
D. Telephone

A telephone shall be available at the Division of
Criminal Justice Headquarters and each field office
for use by the Negotiations Unit representatives for
Negotiations Unit business. This telephone shall be
located within the Negotiations Unil office designed

183
above. The Negotiations Unit shall reimburse the State
for actual telephone charges, if any

The FOP argues that this proposal would allow FOP to be in
communication with its membership, who are scattered among the
State in various locations, its attorney, and/or any other
individual as a situation may warrant. (17-99

The FOP argues that is proposal clearly delineates that it
would be responsible for any charges associated with the use of
the telephone. In other words, the State would merely have to
dedicate one line at each office for use by the FOP
representatives. To this end, the same can be placed in any
office space that is provided for the FOP’s use. The FOP argues
that this proposal would not cause the State to incur any
expenses.

The State maintains that the Union abandoned its proposal
for its own offices and instead agreed to available storage
space for its papers and files. So, essentially what the Union
is asking for is to have telephones located on a file cabinet
that may or may not be available in each of the DCJ’s three
offices.

Donlan testified that the reception on his personal cell
phone is poor at the Whippany field office and that he needs to
exit the building in order to use his cell phone for personal

calls.

184
First, the State argues that it has agreed to provide the
Union with its own page on the DCJ’s intranet through which the
Union may communicate with its members There is nothing in
the record to indicate that the Union’s representatives have had
any difficulty whatsoever in communicating with their membership
over the past four years.

The State avers that not only is the Union’s telephone
proposal unnecessary, it is cost prohibitive. DOJ Chief-of-
Staff Miller looked into complying with the Union’s proposal.
She discovered that the telephone systems in the Whippany and
Cherry Hill offices, and quite possibly the system in the Hughes
Justice Complex in Trenton, are all at maximum capacity. (5T-61-
62)" To add an additional telephone line would require the
installation of an entire new bank of lines in each office at a
cost of approximately $7,000 for each field office, or $21,000
total. As such, the Union’s proposal should be rejected

I understand the Union’s need to occasionally speak with
their members by phone during work hours. Its ability to do so
is compromised in at least the Whippany office as cell phone
reception is poor in that facility. I also understand the
State’s reluctance to expend resources to expand the telephone
line system at each facility to accommodate an additional
telephone line for the Union. However, the record evidence
*° Miller testified that there may be unoccupied DAG offices with telephones

at Lhe DOJ's Trenton office, but that those lines are dedicated to those
offices which will be occupied by DAGs with their own extensions. (51-89-91)

185
reveals that at some locations, there are unassigned “empty”
desks with telephone lines. Therefore, I award the following:

To the extent possible, the State will permit the
Union to have a dedicated telephone line in the Dcu
offices in Whippany, Hughes Justice Complex, and
Cherry Hill. The Union will pay for the cost of line
installation, the telephone instrument and any on-
going charges to maintain the line

DISCIPLINE
The Union proposes,

A. Discipline under this Article means official
written reprimand, fine, suspension without pay
reduction in grade or dismissal from service, based
upon the personal conduct or performance of the
involved employee. Dismissal from service or reduction
in grade based upon a layoff or operational charges
made by the State shall not be construed to be
discipline.

B. Just cause for discipline up to and including
dismissal from service shall include those causes set
forth in N.J.a.c -2.3. The list of causes set
forth in N -2.3 is not exclusive and
discipline up to and including dismissal from service
may be made for any other combination of circumstances
amounting to just cause.

    

 

C. Where the appointing authority or its designee
imposes discipline pursuant to paragraph B., written
notice of such discipline shall be given to the
employee. Such notice shall contain a reasonable
specification of the nature of the charge, a general
description of the alleged acts and/or conduct upon
which the charge is based and the nature of the
discipline. Suspensions will not be implemented before
the expiration of a period of seventy-two (72) hours
from the beginning of the work shift during which the
notice of suspension was given except in cases where
in the judgment of management, the suspension is
directed at an immediate need to maintain safety,
order or effective direction of work assignments

D. The name of any employee who is notified of
suspension or dismissal pursuant to paragraph C. shall

186
be transmitted to the Negotiations Unit as soon as
feasible but not to exceed seventy-two (72) hours
after such notice.

Any appeal relating to the involved disciplinary
matter must be filed by the employee within fifteen
(15) calendar days of notice of discipline to the
employee involved, and the employee must indicate
within the notice of appeal if he will exercise his
right to a Departmental Disciplinary Hearing. The
employee may be represented at such hearing by a
Negotiations Unit representative in the same work unit
and/or legal counsel. The employee shall have the
right to present evidence and witness at such hearing
as well as cross-examine any witnesses or evidence
presented by the State. The circumstances surrounding
a discipline case may suggest that the Negotiations
Unit President or a member of the Unit’s Executive
Board has a particular need to assist in the
presentation at the hearing. He/she may make a request
to do so to the Office of Employee Relations. Such
request shall not be unreasonably denied. The
Department or Agency Head, or his designee, shall
render a written decision within twenty (20) calendar
days from the date of such hearing. The decision
rendered herein shall be final except where the
disciplinary appeal involves a penalty as set forth in
paragraph E. below.

E. In the event the appeal has not been
satisfactorily settled or otherwise resolved and
involves the following contemplated or implemented
penalties:

1. Suspension of more than five (5) days at one
time;
2. Suspensions or fines more than three (3) days or

for an aggregate of more than fifteen (15) days in one
(1) calendar year; or

3. Demotion; then

(a) The Negotiations Unit may appeal the discipline
through the disciplinary arbitration process as herein
provided. To file a timely appeal under the
disciplinary arbitration process the Negotiations Unit
must take the following action:

187
(1) A notice to initiate disciplinary arbitration
must be postmarked within twenty (20) calendar days
from the date the Department Head’s decision was
rendered and sent to the Office of Employee Relations
A request for disciplinary arbitration shall contain
the name of the employee involved, a copy of the
original appeal, the notice of discipline and any
written decisions rendered concerning the matter

(2) In the event the employee involved elects to
appeal the decision to disciplinary arbitration such
election will be deemed final and binding subject to
his rights to appeal under the law

F, An appeal to disciplinary arbitration may be
brought only by the Negotiations Unit through its
President or designee or attorney

G. Within thirty (30) days of the execution of this
Agreement, the parties shall mutually agree upon a
panel of not less than three (3) disciplinary
arbitrators. Each member of the panel shall serve in
turn as the sole arbitrator for a given case. where a
member of the panel is unable to serve, the next
member in sequence shall then serve. In the event the
parties are unable to agree upon a panel of
arbitrators within thirty (30) days, arbitrators shall
be selected, on a case-by-case basis under the
selection procedure of the Public Employment Relations
Commission, until such time as the parties agree upon
a panel. The disciplinary arbitrator shall hold a
hearing at a place convenient to the parties as soon
as possible after the request for arbitration but not
later than thirty (30) days after the arbitrator
accepts the case. The arbitrator shall issue a
decision as soon as possible but not later than thirty
(30) days after the hearing.

H. Arbitrators in disciplinary matters shall confine
themselves to determinations of guilt or innocence and
the appropriateness of penalties and shall neither add
to, subtract from, nor modify any of the provisions of
this Agreement by any decision. In the event the
arbitrator's decision finds the employee innocent or
modifies a penalty, he may reinstate the employee with
back pay for all or part of a period of suspension.

If the employee was reduced in grade, the Arbitrator
may reinstate the employee with back pay for all or
part of the period of reduction. The arbitrator may

188
consider any period of suspension served in suggesting
the penalty to be imposed. Should the arbitrator's
recommendation suggest reduction of the suspension
with back pay for all or part of a period of
suspension or reduction in grade, the employee may be
paid for the hours he would have worked in his
normally scheduled work week, at his normal rate of
pay, but not exceeding forty (40) hours per week or
eight (8) hours per day, less any deductions required
by law or other offsetting income, for the back pay
period suggested by the arbitrator. The arbitrator's
decision shall contain a short statement of the nature
of the proceedings, the positions of the parties and
specific findings and conclusions on the facts. In
addition, the arbitrator’s recommendation shall
discuss the testimony, evidence or positions of the
parties which merits special analysis

It is agreed that this process is not to be utilized
as a device to apply more severe suspensions than
would normally be imposed

I. General Provisions
1. The terms of this Article shall not apply to

provisional employees or employees serving a working
test period, provided such working test period does
not exceed six (6) months. This exclusion shall not
apply to provisional or probationary employees who
otherwise hold permanent appointment in another job
classification in State service except that under no
circumstances will the State’s judgment as to the
adequacy of the employee’s performance in a working
test or provisional status, or any action taken in
pursuance thereof, be deemed to be discipline within
the meaning of this Article. Employees serving their
working test period shall retain all rights under
Civil Service Laws, Rules or Regulations

2. All disciplinary charges shall be brought within
forty-five (45) days of the Division becoming aware or
when the Division should have reasonably been aware of
the offense. In the absence of the institution of the
charge within the 45 day time period, the charge shall
be dismissed with prejudice.

3. In the event a disciplinary action is initiated,

the employee or his/her representative shall be
provided with copies ot all written documents,

189
reports, or statements which will be used against
him/her at such hearing and a list of all known
witnesses who may testify against him/her, which, will
be provided not less than ten (10) days, exclusive of
weekends, prior to the hearing date.

4, Nothing in this Article of Agreement shall be
construed to limit the right of the State to implement
any disciplinary charges notwithstanding the pendency
of any appeal proceeding

5. Before a permanent employee is suspended without
pay pending dismissal, he shall promptly be given an
opportunity for an informal hearing commonly referred
to as a “Laudermill Hearing” at which time the
employee will be informed of the charges made and a
synopsis of the evidence on which the State intends to
rely. The employee shall have an opportunity to
respond and/or refute the evidence or information
presented against him.

6. Where a fine is imposed as a disciplinary measure
and the matter is appealed within the disciplinary
procedure provided in this Agreement and where the
fine is one hundred dollars ($100.00) or more, the
enforcement of the fine will be withheld upon request
of the employee being fined pending hearings and final
disposition of the appeal as provided herein, provided
the employee continues in his employment with the
State.

J. In disciplinary matters involving dismissal from
service, such employees, upon written request, shall
be entitled to a conference with the Department or
Agency Head or his designee to discuss the matter. The
Department or Agency Head or his designee may conduct
an administrative investigation of the matter at his
or her discretion.

K. Nothing in this Article shall be construed as a
waiver of any rights any employee may have under New
Jersey Statutes or Administrative Rules and
Regulations.

The State proposes the following provisions

Discipline:

190
Employee discipline shall be addressed in accordance
with the provisions of this Article and the
Department’s Standard Operating Procedures. Pursuant
to law, this Article does not modify or limit the
Department’s right tu Lerminate, demote or reassign
employees who serve at the pleasure of the Attorney
General. Decisions to terminate, demote or reassign
are not subject to this Article or the grievance and
Arbitration provisions of this Agreement.

Procedures regarding disciplinary matters that do
not include termination, demotion or reassignment,
including those that involve conduct which
constitutes a crime, will be addressed in accordance
with the Department’s Standard Operating Procedures
and will not be inconsistent with the following
provisions.

A. Discipline may be based on:

1. Incompetency, inefficiency or failure to perform
duties;

2. Insubordination;
3. Inability to perform duties;
4. Chronic or excessive absenteeism or lateness;

5. Conviction of a crime, or of any offense involving or
touching the employee's office, position or employment;

6. Conduct unbecoming a public employee;
7. Neglect of duty;
8. Conduct constituting any offenses;

9. Violation of rules, regulations or employment policies
applicable to the employee;

10. Violation of the Department or Division Code of
Ethics;

11. Sexual harassment; and
12. Other just, sufficient cause.

+ Disciplinary charges against an employee must be

191
initiated within a reasonable time after discovery of the
conduct by the department.

C. Should the Division Director or designee determine
that cause for discipline exits, Lhe Director or
designee will serve upon the Employee a “Preliminary
Notice of Disciplinary Action” either by hand delivery
or certified mail along with a copy to the Lodge.

D. Upon receipt of the Preliminary Notice of
Disciplinary Action, the Employee shall have five (5)
calendar days to request a “Departmental Hearing.” If
no request is made the discipline will be finalized and
a Final Notice of Disciplinary Action will issue.
Following the issuance of the Final Notice of
Disciplinary Action, the discipline will be implemented
and shall not be subject to further challenge.

E. If an employee chooses to challenge the
disciplinary action, he/she must request a “Departmental
Hearing” within five (5) days of receipt of the
Preliminary Notice. The request must be in writing to
the issuing Department with a copy to the appropriate
Lodge representative.

F. Within thirty (30) days of the hearing request, (or
such other time as the parties agree), a hearing will be
conducted.

G. The Office of the Attorney General will assign a
Hearing Officer who will hear the evidence and issue a
report. The burden of proof to establish cause for
discipline shall rest with the Department. Employees
shall be entitled to Lodge representation which may be a
Lodge official, attorney or consultant, in the Lodge’s
discretion.

H. Within ten (10) calendar days the Hearing Officer
shall issue a report that will:

1. Identify the date of and participants in the hearing;

2. Specify the charges;

 

3. Summarize the documentary evidence presented;

 

4. Summarize the testimony presented;
5. State the hearing officer's finding of facts and
conclusions, including any decisions concerning the

192
credibility of witnesses; and

6. Make recommended findings as to whether the charges have
been sustained and recommendations as to penalty.

Where the legal issues presented are significant, the
hearing officer may recommend that the Attorney General
review the report and render the decision.

I. The hearing officer will submit the report to the
Attorney General, the Division Director or designee,
the employee involved and the Lodge

J. The Attorney General or designee will review the

Hearing Officer's Report and within twenty (20) calendar

days of the hearing will issue a “Final Departmental

Decision.” The time frame may be expanded with the

express written consent of the Lodge.

Kk. The Final Departmental Decision may adopt, reject

or modify the hearing officer's recommended factual

findings and recommendations as to penalty.

L. The Attorney General or designee will execute a

Final Notice of Disciplinary Action. The Final Notice of

Discipline will specify the charge, the penalty, the date

of discipline.

M. ‘The Final Notice of Disciplinary Action will be

served upon the employee and the Lodge and disciplinary

action will be implemented as appropriate. The Final

Notice of Disciplinary Action is not subject to the

grievance and arbitration provisions of this Agreement.

First, the FOP concedes that the Commission issued a ruling
prohibiting FOP from challenging the State’s right to terminate
a detective without cause pursuant to the relevant law. This
issue is currently pending before the Superior Court of New
Jersey, Appellate Division. The Union acknowledges that
xeassignments may not be challenged unless FOP feels the process

is being used as a disciplinary tool. Additionally, demotion is

a recognized form of discipline under the rules and regulations

193
of the Civil Service Commission. As a result, and the absence
of any statutory criteria that says otherwise, FOP believes it
has the right to challenge demotions under this particular
proposed article of the collective negotiations agreement.

Aside from the procedural aspects as to when discovery is
to be provided, the major differences between the proposals are
the time limit in which discipline is to be initiated and
whether FOP has the right to challenge disciplinary actions
through an independent arbitration process.

Here, the FOP asserts that under its proposal, discipline
must be initiated “within 45 days of the Division becoming aware
ox when the Division should have reasonably been aware of the
offense.” The institution of disciplinary charges within a 45-
day time period is a statutory protection that all county and
municipal law enforcement officers in the State of New Jersey
enjoy. See N.J.S.A 48:14-147. Additionally, the State Police

5321-33.

 

also enjoy this protection pursuant to N.J.S.A

 

Finally, for those law enforcement officers that do have such
statutory protection, it has been negotiated into their
collective bargaining agreements.  (FOP-19)

The Union argues that the State’s proposal to initiate
discipline “within a reasonable time after the discovery of the
conduct by the department” is flawed for several reasons.
First, there is no definition proposed in regard to what is

“reasonable” under the contract. The State and FOP will

194
inevitably have vastly different interpretations regarding what
is a “reasonable” timeframe within which to initiate
disciplinary charges. The FOP argues Llal Lhe State’s proposed
appeal process does not provide any method for the FOP to
challenge the definition of “reasonable” in a specific
circumstance.

The Union argues that if the State’s disciplinary proposal
is awarded, the FOP will not have the ability to have discipline
reviewed by an independent, unbiased party. Therefore, the
State will determine what is “reasonable” in regard to the
timeframe of when charges should have been initiated in a
disciplinary matter.

The second major difference between the parties’ proposals
concerns the appeal process of disciplinary charges lodged
against a FOP member. The State proposes that disciplinary
charges (exclusive of termination) may be appealed in finality
to a designee of the State Attorney General, who will issue a
decision concerning guilt and/or innocence along with the
proposed penalty in regard to the same. FOP’s proposal allows
disciplinary charges (also exclusive of termination) to proceed
to binding arbitration. DCJ detectives are not Civil Service
employees and, therefore, disciplinary charges against them
cannot be adjudicated at the New Jersey State Office of
Administrative Law. Additionally, the arbitrator’s decision may

be appealed by either party to the Superior Court of New Jersey

195
as a matter of law, much like any other arbitration decision
that is rendered in the grievance process

The FOP asserts that its language is mirrored after the
contractual language the State agreed to with the Communications
Workers of America. The Union argues that, contrary to the
State’s assertion that State law preempts disciplinary appeals
to binding arbitration, DCJ detectives may contest major
disciplinary infractions, including termination, through binding

arbitration in accordance with N

 

8

 

34:

 

3A-5.3. Therefore,
it is obvious FOP’s proposal is within the scope of
negotiations. Specifically, N.J.S.A. 34:13A-5.3 provides in
pertinent part:

Where the State of New Jersey and the majority
representative have agreed to a disciplinary
review procedure that provides for binding
arbitration of disputes involving the major
discipline of any public employee protected under
the provisions of this section, other than public
employees subject to discipline pursuant to
R.S.53:110 [State Police], the grievance and
disciplinary review procedures established by
agreement between the State of New Jersey and the
majority representative shall be utilized for any
dispute covered by the terms of such agreement.
For purposes of this section, major discipline
shall mean a removal, disciplinary demotion
suspension or fine of more than five days...
(N.J.S.A, 34:13A-5.3.]

 

 

The wording of N.J.S.A. 34:13A-5.3 makes it unequivocally
clear that the State and a majority representative, can include
a disciplinary review procedure in the contract that provides

for binding arbitration of disputes involving major discipline.

196
The statute further provides that the only public employee group
excluded from agreeing to such binding arbitration is the New
Jerscy State Police. Consequently, the State’s assertion that
such a proposal by FOP is not mandatorily negotiable is contrary
to the unambiguous wording of N.J.S.A. 34:13A-5.3 and, as such,
must be rejected.

The Union argues that a public employment disciplinary
policy that does not provide an employee with an independent,
unbiased binding review of the alleged wrongful conduct and
penalties flies in the face of fundamental fairness.

The State argues that its proposal reflects a discipline
provision that is appropriate for a collective negotiations
agreement covering at-will employees. The State’s proposal
references the Division’s SOP entitled “Discipline Procedures
for Investigative Personnel.” The SOP has been in existence at
least since 1993 and most recently updated in 2000. The SOP
expressly references the Attorney General’s right to terminate
demote or assign unclassified civil service investigators “at-
will,” as established with “due regard for employee rights
guaranteed by Title 4A of the New Jersey Administrative Code, a
collective bargaining agreement, statute or by case law.” In
essence, the State proposes to incorporate the SOP into the
contract and ensure that the SOP remains consistent with the
provisions of the contract. There is no provision in the

State’s proposal that truncates or limits the process currently

197
contained in the SOP. The State notes that the Union’s proposal
varies substantially from the SOP and seeks to capture
substantive rights not contained therein

Significantly, the State argues that the Union offered no
evidence or rationale in support of its proposals at the
hearing. Given that the Union is seeking significant changes to
the current practice without any evidentiary support for those
changes, the Arbitrator should reject the Union’s Discipline
proposal out-of-hand and award the State’s proposal

The Union proposes that suspensions of more than five days
and demotion be subject to binding disciplinary arbitration
Those disciplinary actions are “major disciplines” as defined by

N.J.A.C. 4A:2-22, Therefore, the Union’s proposal is non-

 

 

negotiable under well-settled law, State of New Jersey and State

Trooper’s Fraternal Association 134 NJ 393 (1993), Monmouth

 

County and CWA, 300 NJ. Super 272 (App. Div. 1997) and re-
affirmed in the scope of negotiations decision in this matter

State of New Jersey and New Jersey Division of Criminal Justice

 

Non-Commissioned Officers Association et. al., P.E.R.C. No.

 

2014-50, at fn., p. 10 (2013). Accordingly, that portion of the
Union’s proposal seeking to arbitrate suspensions of five days
or more falls outside the scope of negotiations and, thus, must
be rejected.

The State notes that the Union also seeks to have

“suspensions or fines of more than three days or for an

198
aggregate of more than fifteen days in one calendar year.”
Besides being incongruous with the rest of the provision, the

language appears to be a reference to one of the definitions of
“major discipline” set forth in N.J.S.A, 34:13A-5.3. The fact

remains that the Court in State Troopers Fraternal Association

 

ruled explicitly that such discipline cannot be subject to
binding arbitration. As a result, each of the Union's proposals
as they relate to binding arbitration cannot be awarded and,
thus, its proposals must be rejected.

The State argues that the Union’s proposed “45-day rule”
providing for finite length of time with in which discipline may
be brought should not be awarded. The Union introduced two
statutes applicable to State Police and local police
respectively. The State argues that the Union offered
absolutely no further evidence as to the basis for awarding its
proposal. The Union proffered no evidence that, for example
charges against a detective have been unfairly delayed
Further, the State argues that while the State legislature
consciously enacted the “45-day” rule for State and local
police, it did not do so for many categories of law enforcement
personnel and in particular the “at-will” personnel at issue
here in the Department of Law and Public Safety.

As Dee testified, there is no context for applying the 45-
day rule to employees who are “at-will.” Discipline is a tool

for management to communicate expectations to employees and

199
provide them notice and an opportunity to remediate. If you
remove the tool from management because of some arbitrary time
limitations, Lhen the only option left is removal. The State
asserts that such a result serves neither party’s interests.
The State maintains that at-will employees do not possess
rights pursuant to “Laudermill” and the arbitrator has no basis
to create such rights in this agreement. The Union offered no
testimony or evidence concerning its request for a “Laudermill
hearing.” Therefore, the Arbitrator cannot award it. The
proposal references “permanent” employees which, DCJ employees
are not -- they are at-will employees. At-will employees have

no Laudermill rights. See e.g., Thomas v. Town of Hammonton et.

 

al., 351 F3d 108, 112 (2003)

The State further asserts that the Union provided no
explanation or support for its proposals concerning the delay in
the implementation of fines or termination conference.
Similarly, the Union provided no explanation or context for its
proposal concerning a conference with the Department Head
(presumably the Attorney General) in “matters involving

dismissal.” (J-10, p.23, 20(I)) Furthermore, the record is

devoid of any evidence regarding the purported purpose of the

 

conference or what is intended by the proposal: “The Department
or Agency Head or his designee may conduct an Administrative

Investigation of the matter at his or her discretion.”

200
Here, the State argues that having failed to satisfy its
burden of proof relative to such proposals, the Union is not
entitled to have its proposal awarded.

The parties disagree about what discipline may be appealed
and whether it may be appealed to binding arbitration. The
Commission ruled the State’s right to terminate employees and
major discipline, may be without just cause and may not be
appealed. In State of NJ, P.E.R.C. No. 2014-50, the Commission
reviewed the scope of negotiations of several of the FOP’s
proposals and determined that Article 25 “Terminations” is
preempted. The Commission also determined that Article 24
Section A (Just cause) is not mandatorily negotiable. The
Commission held that the Attorney General is required to
negotiate over proposed Article 24, Sections B., C., K.1., and
$.6, finding that these provisions are procedural or
informational and do not interfere with managerial prerogatives.

Finally, the Commission found that, to the extent the
proposals would authorize binding arbitration of minor
discipline, a negotiated agreement on that proposal would not
interfere with the Attorney General’s statutory right to remove
an investigator. The Commission found that the proposal
comports with existing law allowing arbitral review of minor
discipline of law enforcement personnel. The Commission

rejected the State’s argument, based on State of N.J. and State

201
Troopers Fraternal Ass'n., 134 N.J. 393 (1993) (“State

 

Troopers”), that the members of FOP’s unit could not use
arbitration to review minor disciplinary sanctions. In 1996,

N.J.S.A. 34:13A-5.3 was amended to allow police, except State

 

Police, to contest minor discipline through binding grievance
arbitration, and the amendments did not exclude other state law
enforcement officers.
Just Cause

The Commission found the paragraph which proposed
discipline be imposed only for just cause to be not mandatorily
negotiable. The Attorney General argued that it would interfere
with his right to remove unit members. The Commission then
approved the provision calling for binding arbitration of minor
discipline. I construe the Commission’s findings on just cause
to be limited to removal and other major forms of discipline,
not to minor discipline. Further, the State has a just cause
provision in its “Discipline SOP for Investigative Personnel”
Having argued that its SOP is the longstanding practice of the
Division, and should be incorporated into the collective
agreement, the State cannot now argue against its own pre-
existing just cause standard. The State has already committed
itself to this standard. Therefore, I award the just cause
provision for minor discipline only

FOP Proposals

202
I will begin by a discussion of the parties’ proposals
beginning with FOP proposals A through K. The six particular
issues the State identified in its brief are: a 72-hour delay in
the implementation of suspensions, arbitration of major
discipline, a 45-day statute of limitations rule, “Laudermill”
hearing rights, suspension of the imposition of disciplinary
fines; and termination conferences with the Attorney General

I. Demotions And Reassignments Appeal Rights

 

The Union proposes that demotions be considered discipline
subject to binding arbitration. It contends that demotions are
a universally recognized form of discipline, including under
Civil Service rules and that there is no statutory prohibition
against the right to challenge demotions. The State asserts
that demotions cannot be challenged under the disciplinary
process.

The FOP proposes that where reassignments are used as a
disciplinary tool, they may be challenged through binding
arbitration under the grievance procedure. The State asserts
that reassignments are managerial prerogatives and may not be
appealed.

I find that demotions are major discipline and are not
arbitrable. However, I find that that the FOP is entitled to
appeal reassignments made for disciplinary reasons through the
grievance and arbitration procedure.

II. Arbitrability Of Discipline

203
I award the FOP’s paragraph A, with the addition of just
cause and deletion of reduction in grade and dismissals. I
award FOP’s proposals B, and C. Paragraph D is awarded except
for the last sentence: “The decision rendered herein shall be
final except where the disciplinary appeal involves a penalty as
set forth in paragraph E. below.”

Paragraph E is not awarded because it provides procedures
for appealing major discipline.

I find that, with the exceptions noted, the FOP’s proposals
to challenge minor disciplinary actions through an independent
binding arbitration process are reasonable and I award them.
See, PERC No. 2014-050. This excludes major disciplines
suspension of more than five days, suspensions or fines more
than three days or for an aggregate of more than fifteen days in
one calendar year, and demotions

I award the FOP’s paragraph F.

Paragraph G is awarded in part. The last two sentences of
FOP’s paragraph G are modified because the proposed timeframes
are unreasonable. I award:

The disciplinary arbitrator shall hold a hearing at a

place and time mutually convenient to the parties as

Soon aS possible after the request for arbitration

The arbitrator shall issue a decision as soon as

possible, preferably within thirty (30) days after the

hearing is closed. (Additions/Modifications are
underlined)

 

 

204
Paragraph H is awarded in part. The third and last
sentences are removed. The third sentence refers to a major
furm of discipline, and the last sentence prohibiting the
arbitration process from being used to apply more severe
suspensions -- is unnecessary

Paragraph I(1) is excised as it does not apply to the
unclassified employees who comprise this unit. Paragraph 1(2),
the 45-day rule, is awarded for the reasons below. Paragraph I
(3) and (4) are awarded.

Paragraph I(5), Loudermill hearing, is not awarded, see
PERC No. 2014-050, and discussion below.

Paragraph I (6) is awarded.

Paragraph J concerns major discipline and is not awarded

Paragraph K is awarded

III. Timing Of Initiating Discipline

 

The FOP proposes discipline should be initiated “within 45
days” of the Division having become aware or from the date when
the Division reasonably should have been aware of the offense
(paragraph 1(2)).” The State proposes that disciplinary charges
be initiated “within a reasonable time”. The State argues that
no evidence supports the restrictive 45-day rule

I award the FOP’s proposal. The institution of
disciplinary charges within a 45-day period is statutory for all
county and municipal law enforcement officers in the State of

New Jersey. N.J.S.A 40

 

4-147 provides, in relevant part:

205
A complaint charging a violation of the internal rules
and regulations established for the conduct of a law
enforcement unit shall be filed no later than the 45th
day after the date on which the person filing the
complaint obtained sufficient information to file the
matter upon which the complaint is based.

Additionally, a similar provision applies to the State

Police through N.d.S.A. 53:1-33. Other State law enforcement

 

units contain a 45-day provision as well, notably those between
the State and NJLESA, and the State and NJSOLEA.

The State argues the Union’s “45-day Rule” proposal should
be denied. It asserts that while the legislature enacted the
“45-day” rule for State and local police, it did not do so for
many categories of law enforcement personnel and in particular
these detectives. The State further asserts there is no context
for applying the 45-day rule to employees who are at-will and
that discipline is a tool for management to communicate
expectations to employees and provide them notice and a chance
to correct their behavior, and if this tool is taken from
management because of some arbitrary time limitations, then the
only option left is removal. I find these arguments are without
merit and that the open-ended “reasonable time” standard could
encourage future disputes and litigation
IV. Loudermill Hearing

The Union’s Loudermill hearing proposal is not awarded
The State asserts that the Union offered no testimony or

evidence concerning its request for a “Loudermill Hearing,” and

206
the proposal references “permanent” (classified) employees
which under Civil service regulations means employees who
acquire property rights to their jobs resulting from regular
appointment and successful completion of a working test period,
in contrast to the FOP’s unit employees who are unclassified.

N.J.A.C. S4A:1-1.3. The Court in Cleveland Bd. of Educ. V.

 

Loudermill, 470 U.S. 532 (1985), relied on the public employee's
property interest in his job to grant him due process (notice
and opportunity to be heard) procedures before termination.
Since the employees in the FOP’s unit serve at the pleasure of
the Division and Attorney General, and are unclassified, no
property rights appear to attach to their employment.

In P.E.R.C. No. 2014-050, the Commission found not
mandatorily negotiable: “L.5. Before a permanent career service
employee is suspended without pay pending dismissal, he shall
promptly be given an opportunity for an informal hearing at
which the employee will be informed of the charges made and a
synopsis of the evidence on which the State intends to rely.”
It found the Section as written not mandatorily negotiable
because a public employer has the prerogative to impose an
immediate suspension of a law enforcement officer, without
having to observe pre-disciplinary procedures. The Union's
Loudermill hearing proposal is L.5 above, which the Commission

found is not mandatorily negotiable. PERC No. 2014-050.

207
The State seeks to incorporate in its entirety the
Division’s discipline SOP into the discipline article of the
contract. It argues that the SOP is comprehensive and has been
in existence at least since 1993, and recently updated in 2000.
It argues that the SOP, has “due regard for employee rights
guaranteed by Title 4A of the New Jersey Administrative Code, a
collective bargaining agreement, statute or by case law.” 1
decline to incorporate the disciplinary SOP wholesale into the
contract because it is too long and many parts are inappropriate
for inclusion in a collective agreement because they are the
State's procedures and protocols.

I now address the State’s specific proposals. The State’s

 

proposed introductory paragraphs are modified:
Employee discipline shall be addressed in accordance
with the provisions of this Article. Decisions to
terminate, demote or reassign are not subject to this
Article or the grievance and Arbitration provisions of
this Agreement.
I awarded the Union’s proposal (paragraphs A and B.
defining minor discipline and referring to N.J.A.C. 4A:2-2.3.
The State’s proposed paragraph B providing that discipline
be initiated by the department within a reasonable time after
discovery is not awarded. See discussion of “Timing of
Initiating Discipline” at III above

The State’s paragraph C is not awarded -~ see paragraphs C

and D of the FOP’s proposal.

208
The State’s paragraphs D through M refer to the conduct of
an internal departmental hearing. I award these provisions as
written, except where I have modified them to avoid a conflict
with other findings. These modifications include:

In Paragraph D., the first sentence is merged with the
first sentence of paragraph E below. The second and third
sentences are not awarded. These provide that where an employee
does not request a departmental hearing within 5 days, his or
her discipline becomes final. The discipline article provides,
for minor discipline, for finality of disputes through binding
arbitration and thus, these two sentences conflict with those
procedures.

Section E. is modified to remove the phrase “to challenge
the disciplinary action” since employees have an alternate
procedure -- binding arbitration -- to challenge discipline
The new paragraph E is:

If an employee chooses, he/she must request a
“Departmental Hearing” within five (5) days of
receipt of the Preliminary Notice. The request

must be in writing to the issuing Department with
a copy to the appropriate Lodge representative.

 

Paragraphs F, G, H, I and K -- departmental hearings -- are
awarded as written. Paragraph J, proving for a conference with
management when an employee is being terminated, is not awarded.

This proposed language conflicts with the concepts of at-will

employment and are therefore inappropriate. Paragraphs L and M

209
are eliminated because they conflict with the binding
arbitration of minor discipline.
I award the following:

A. Discipline under this Article means official
written reprimand, fine, suspension without pay, based
upon the personal conduct or performance of the
involved employee. As they are major discipline
dismissals from service, suspensions exceeding five

(5) days, and reductions in grade (demotions) either
for discipline, layoff or for operational changes
shall not be grievable or arbitrable

B. Just cause for minor discipline up to five days
suspension shall include those causes set forth in
N.J.A.C. 4A:2-2.3. The list of causes set forth in
A.C. 4A:2-2.3 is not exclusive and discipline up
to and including dismissal from service may be made
for any other combination of circumstances amounting
to just cause.

 

 

  

C. Where the Division imposes discipline pursuant to
paragraph B., written notice - “Preliminary Notice of
Discipline” - of such discipline shall be given to the
employee. Such notice shall contain a reasonable
specification of the nature of the charge, a general
description of the alleged acts and/or conduct upon
which the charge is based and the nature of the
discipline.

D. The name of any employee who is notified of suspension or
dismissal pursuant to paragraph C. shall be transmitted to
the Negotiations Unit as soon as feasible but not to exceed
seventy-two (72) hours after such notice

Any appeal, except for departmental hearings (see below),
relating to the involved disciplinary matter must be filed
by the employee within fifteen (15) calendar days of the
notice of discipline to the employee, and the employee must
indicate within the notice of appeal if he will exercise
his right to a Departmental Disciplinary Hearing

The employee may be represented at such hearing by a
Negotiations Unit representative in the same work unit
and/or legal counsel. The employee shall have the right to
present evidence and witnesses at such hearing as well as

210
cross-examine any witnesses or evidence presented by the
State.

The circumstances surrounding a discipline case may suggest
that the Negotiations Unit President or a member of the
Unit's Executive Board has a particular need to assist in
the presentation at the hearing. He/she may make a request
to do so to the Office of Employee Relations. Such request
shall not be unreasonably denied.

(E. Not awarded]

Arbitration

FE.

An appeal to disciplinary arbitration may be brought only
by the Negotiations Unit through its President or designee
or attorney.

Within thirty (30) days of the execution of this Agreement
the parties shall mutually agree upon a panel of not less
than three (3) disciplinary arbitrators. Each member of
the panel shall serve in turn as the sole arbitrator for a
given case. Where a member of the panel is unable to
serve, the next member in sequence shall then serve. In
the event the parties are unable to agree upon a panel of
arbitrators within thirty (30) days, arbitrators shall be
selected, on a case-by-case basis under the selection
procedure of the Public Employment Relations Commission,
until such time as the parties agree upon a panel. The
disciplinary arbitrator shall hold a hearing at a time and
place mutually convenient to the parties as soon as
possible after the request for arbitration. The arbitrator
shall issue a decision as soon as possible, preferably

within thirty (30) days after the hearing is closed.

Arbitrators in disciplinary matters shall confine
themselves to determinations of guilt or innocence and the
appropriateness of penalties and shall neither add to,
subtract from, nor modify any of the provisions of this
Agreement by any decision. In the event the arbitrator’s
decision finds the employee innocent or modifies a penalty,
he/she may reinstate the employee with back pay for all or
part of a period of suspension. The arbitrator may
consider any period of suspension served in suggesting the
penalty to be imposed.

Should the arbitrator's recommendation suggest reduction of

the suspension with back pay for all or part of a period of
suspension, the employee may be paid for the hours he would

211
a.

have worked in his normally scheduled work week, at his
normal rate of pay, but not exceeding forty (40) hours per
week or eight (8) hours per day, less any deductions
required by law or other offsetting income, for the back
pay period suggested by the arbitrator

The arbitrator’s decision shall contain a short statement
of the nature of the proceedings, the positions of the
parties and specific findings and conclusions on the facts.
In addition, the arbitrator’s recommendation shall discuss
the testimony, evidence or positions of the parties which
merits special analysis

General Provisions

1. All disciplinary charges shall be brought within
forty-five (45) days of the Division becoming aware or
when the Division should have reasonably been aware of
the offense. In the absence of the institution of the
charge within the 45 day time period, the charge shall
be dismissed with prejudice.

2. In the event a a disciplinary action is initiated, the
employee or his/her representative shall be provided
with copies of all written documents, reports, or
statements which will be used against him/her and a
list of all known witnesses who may testify against
him/her, which, will be provided not less than ten
(10) days, exclusive of weekends, prior to any
departmental hearing date

3. Nothing in this Article of Agreement shall be
construed to limit the right of the State to implement
any disciplinary charges notwithstanding the pendency
of any appeal proceeding.

4. Where a fine is imposed as a disciplinary measure and
the matter is appealed within the disciplinary
procedure provided in this Agreement and where the
fine is one hundred dollars ($100.00) or more, the
enforcement of the fine will be withheld upon request
of the employee being fined pending hearings and final
disposition of the appeal as provided herein, provided
the employee continues in his employment with the
State.

(not awarded)

212
Nothing in this Article shall be construed as a waiver of
any rights any employee may have under New Jersey Statutes
or Administrative Rules and Regulations.

(not awarded)

(not awarded)

Departmental Hearing

If an employee chooses a departmental hearing, he/she must
request a Hearing within five (5) days of receipt of the
“preliminary Notice of Discipline.” The request must be in
writing to the issuing Division in the Department with a
copy to the appropriate FOP 91 representative.

Within thirty (30) days of the hearing request, (or such
other time as the parties agree), a hearing will be
conducted.

The Office of the Attorney General will assign a Hearing
Officer who will hear the evidence and issue a report. The
burden of proof to establish cause for discipline shall
rest with the Department. Employees shall be entitled to
Lodge representation which may be a Lodge official
attorney or consultant, in the Lodge’s discretion.

Within ten (10) calendar days the Hearing Officer shall
issue a report that will:

1. Identify the date of and participants in the hearing;
2. Specify the charges;

3. Summarize the documentary evidence presented,

4. Summarize the testimony presented;

5. State the hearing officer's finding of facts and

conclusions, including any decisions concerning the
credibility of witnesses; and

6. Make recommended findings as to whether the charges
have been sustained and recommendations as to penalty.

Where the legal issues presented are significant, the
hearing officer may recommend that the Attorney General
review the report and render the decision.

The hearing officer will submit the report to the Attorney

General, the Division Director or designee, the employee
involved and the Lodge.

213
6. The Attorney General or designee will review the Hearing
Officer’s Report and within twenty (20) calendar days of
the hearing will issue a “Final Departmental Decision.”
The time frame may be expanded with the express written
consent of the Lodge.

7, The Final Departmental Decision may adopt, reject or modify
the hearing officer's recommended factual findings and
recommendations as to penalty.

8. The Attorney General or designee will execute a Final
Notice of Disciplinary Action. The Final Notice of Discipline
will specify the charge, the penalty, the date of discipline.

GRIEVANCE PROCEDURE
The Union proposes the following contract language:
B. Grievance Definition

A “Grievance” is:

1. Aclaimed breach, misinterpretation or improper
application of the terms of this Agreement
(contractual grievance); or

2.  A-claimed violation, misinterpretation or
misapplication of rules or regulations, existing
policies, letters or memoranda of agreement,
administrative decisions, or laws, applicable to the
agency or department which employs the grievant
affecting the terms and conditions of employment and
which are not included in A.1 above. (non-contractual
grievance) .

C. Purpose and Employee and/or Negotiations Unit Rights

 

1. The purpose of this procedure is to assure prompt and
equitable solutions of problems arising from the
administration of the Agreement, or other conditions
of employment by providing the exclusive vehicle set
forth in this Article for the settlement of employee
grievances.

2. It is agreed that the individual employee is entitled
to use this grievance procedure and to be represented
by the Negotiations Unit upon his request in
accordance with the provisions hereof. He/she shall
not be coerced, intimidated or suffer any reprisal as

214
D.

w

a direct or indirect result of such use. The
Negotiations Unit shall be notified of any scheduled
grievance hearing.

Nothing in this Agreement shall be construed as
compelling the Negotiations Unit to submit a grievance
to arbitration. The Negotiations Unit’s decision to
request the movement of any grievance at any step or
to terminate the grievance at any step shall be final
as to the interests of the grievant and the
Negotiations Unit.

No grievance settlement reached under the terms of the
Agreement shall add to, subtract from or modify any
terms of this Agreement.

Where an individual grievant initiates a grievance,
such grievance shall only be processed through
Negotiations Unit representation, unless the
Negotiations Unit provides specific permission to the
contrary.

Scope of Grievance

te

It is understood by the parties that this grievance
procedure represents the exclusive process for the
resolution of disputed matters arising out of the
Grievance Definition, A.1. and 2. above, except for
those specific matters listed beloi

 

(a). Appeals of matters in disputes shall be made
directly to the Civil Service Commission
subsequent to proper notification to the
responsible local management officials with
regard to the following subjects only:

(1) Out-of-title work

(2) Position classification and re-evaluation
review

(3) Layoff and recall rights

(4) Examination procedures for which an appeal
exists

(5) Removal at completion of a working test
period

215
E.

(b). For purposes of this Agreement, the terms and
conditions of employment shall be those matters
which intimately and directly affect the work and
welfare of the employees covered hereunder and
which do not significantly interfere with the
exercise of inherent management prerogatives
pertinent to the determination of government
policy.

(1). A claim of improper and unjust discipline
against an employee shall be processed in
accordance with the provisions of the
Agreement regarding Discipline.

(2). Reference by name or title or otherwise
in this Agreement to laws, rules, regulations,
formal policies or orders of the State, shall
not be construed as bringing any allegation
concerning the interpretation or application
of such matters within the scope of
arbitrability as set forth in this Agreement
except as provided in this Agreement

General Rules and Procedures

1.

Where the subject of a grievance, or its emergent
nature, suggests it is appropriate, and where the
parties mutually agree, such grievance may be
initiated at or moved to any step of the procedure
without hearing at a lower step. Where the
Negotiations Unit requests a grievance be initiated at
Step Two or beyond based on a claim of emergency
wherein the normal processing of the grievance would
prejudice the effective relief sought and/or the
substantive rights of the grievant and, if such
request is denied by the agency of the State involved,
the Negotiations Unit may seek an expedited
determination by the Office of Employee Relations of
the appropriate step to initiate such grievance. If
the Negotiations Unit is not satisfied with this
determination, then the issue of whether or not an
emergency exists may be brought to an expedited
arbitration hearing. The option to be prescribed
would be to initiate at Step Two.

Where a grievance directly concerns and is shared by
more than one grievant, such group grievance may
properly be initiated at the first level of
supervision common to the several grievants, with the

216
mutual consent of the parties as to the appropriate
step. The presentation of such group grievance will be
by the appropriate Negotiations Unit representative (s
and one of the affected grievants designated by the
Negotiations Unit. A group grievance may be initiated
by the Negotiations Unit.

Any member of the collective negotiating unit may
orally present and discuss his/her complaint with
his/her immediate supervisor on an informal basis

Such discussion of a complaint will not preclude the
member from initiating a grievance under the terms and
conditions of this Article

In the event that the grievance has not been
satisfactorily resolved on an informal basis, then an
appeal may be made on the grievance form specified
below.

All such grievances shall be presented in writing to
the designated representative of the party against
whom it is made on the “Grievance Forms” to be
provided by the State. Such forms shall make adequate
provision for the representative of each of the
parties hereto to maintain a written record of all
action taken in handling and disposing of the
grievance at each step of the Grievance Procedure. The
form shall contain a general description of the
relevant facts from which the grievance derives and
references to the sections of the Agreement, if any
which the grievant claims have been violated. The
grievance form must be completed in its entirety. A
group grievance initiated by the Negotiations Unit may
be presented on the above form, or where appropriate
in another format provided that the grievance is fully
set forth in writing and contains all the information
called for by said form.

When a grievance is initiated, the original form shall
be forwarded to the Personnel Officer of the
appropriate operating agency. Copies of completed
grievance forms shall be made by the State and
distributed to the Negotiations Unit at the conclusion
of the State taking action at each step of the
Grievance Procedure

Grievance resolutions or decisions at Step One and

Step Two shall not constitute a precedent in any
arbitration or other proceeding unless a specific

217
agreement to that effect is made by the Office of
Employee Relations and the Attorney of the
Negotiations Unit. This shall not be construed to
preclude either party from introducing relevant
evidence, including such grievance resolutions, as to
the prior conduct of the other party

F, Grievance Time Limits and Management Response

 

ds

A grievance must be filed initially within fifteen
(15) calendar days from the date on which the act
which is the subject of the grievance occurred or
fifteen (15) calendar days from the date on which the
grievant knew or should reasonably have known of its
occurrence. If the alleged grievance involves an
alleged continuing violation of the contract, the
fifteen (15) day deadline shall be relaxed. Other
references to days in this process are working days of
the party to which they apply.

Where a grievance exclusively involves an alleged
error in calculation of salary payments, the grievance
may be timely filed within ninety (90) days of the
time the individual should reasonably have known of
its occurrence.

Decisions after a scheduled hearing shall be rendered
in writing to the grievant and to the Negotiations
Unit representative within established time limits
except that the decision will be considered timely if
rendered within the following limits or within three
(3) days after the conclusion of the hearing at Step
One and fifteen (15) days after the conclusion of the
hearing at Step Two whichever is later

(a) At Step One within ten (10) working days of the
receipt of the grievance;

(b) At Step Two, within fifteen (15) working days of
the receipt of the appeal from the Step One
decision.

Should a grievance not be satisfactorily resolved, or
should the employer not respond within the prescribed
time periods, either after initial receipt of the
grievance or after a hearing, the grievance may be
appealed within ten (10) working days to the next
step. The lack of response by the State within the
prescribed time periods, unless time limits have been

218
extended by mutual agreement, should be construed as a
negative response.

5. When a grievance appeal is to be filed, the State
representative at the last hearing shall inform the
grievant of the name and position of the next higher
level of management to whom the appeal should be
presented.

6. Time limits under this Article may be changed by
mutual agreement and requests for extensions of time
limits will not be unreasonably denied

7. If, at any step in the grievance procedure, the
State’s decision is not appealed within the
appropriate prescribed time, such grievance will be
considered closed and there shall be no further appeal
or review.

Where an extraordinary circumstance precludes the
timely appeal of the grievance at any step, the
Negotiations Unit may promptly seek a waiver of the
time limit for such appeal by direct request to the
Office of Employee Relations. Such request shall not
be unreasonably denied

8. No adjustment of any grievance shall impose
retroactivity beyond the date on which the grievance
was initiated or the fifteen (15) day period provided
in E.1. above except that payroll errors and related
matters shall be corrected to date of error

Grievance Investigation - Time Off

 

When a grievance has been formally submitted in writing and
the Negotiations Unit represents the grievant, and where
the Negotiations Unit Representative or other officer
requires time to investigate such grievance to achieve an
understanding of the specific work problem during working
hours, the Representative or Officer will be granted
permission and reasonable time, to a limit of one (1) hour,
to investigate without loss of pay. It is understood that
the supervisor shall schedule such time release providing
the work responsibilities of the Negotiations Unit
Representative or Officer and of any involved employee are
adequately covered and providing further there is no
disruption of work. Such time release shall not be
unreasonably withheld and upon request could be extended
beyond the one (1) hour limit for specified reasons if, to

219
the supervisor, the circumstances warrant an exception to
this limit. Where a Negotiations Unit Representative or
other Officer serves a mutually agreed upon grievance
district encompassing two (2) or more geographically
separated work locations and where the circumstances
require it, a supervisor shall authorize the additional
time required for travel

Such time release shall not be construed to include
preparation of paperwork, record keeping, conferences among
Negotiations Unit officials nor preparation for
presentation at a grievance hearing.

Time Off for Grievance Hearings

1. An employee shall be allowed time off without loss of
pay?

(a) As may be required for appearance at a hearing of
the employee’s grievance scheduled during working
hours;

(b) For necessary travel time to and from the
grievance hearing during working hours;

If the hearing extends beyond the employee’s normal
working hours, compensatory time equal to the
additional time spent at the hearing shall be granted
but such time shall not be considered time worked for
the computation of overtime.

2. Where the employee or the Negotiations Unit requests
employee witnesses, permission for a reasonable number
of witnesses required during the grievance proceedings
will be granted. A witness at such proceedings will be
permitted to appear without loss of pay for the time
of appearance and travel time as required if during
his/her normal scheduled working hours

3. At Step One and beyond in the grievance procedure
witnesses may be heard and pertinent records received.

The Negotiations Unit representative may have the
right directly to examine or cross-examine witnesses
who appear at any step of this procedure

Grievances shall be presented and adjusted in accordance
with the following procedures:

220
Step One

If the grievance is not satisfactorily disposed of
informally, it may be filed with the highest operational
management representative. He or his designee shall hear
the grievance, witnesses may be heard and pertinent records
received. The grievant may be represented by an employee in
the same work unit designated by the Negotiations Unit or a
Negotiations Unit officer at the institution or
installation involved. The circumstances surrounding a
grievance may suggest that the Negotiations Unit President
or a member of the Unit’s Executive Board has a particular
need to assist in the presentation of the grievance at Step
One. He/she may make a request to do so to the Office of
Employee Relations. Such request shall not be unreasonably
denied.

Step Two

If the grievance is not satisfactorily disposed of at Step
One, it may be appealed to the department head or his
designee who shall not be a person who was directly
involved in the grievance. The appeal shall be accompanied
by the decisions at the preceding level and any written
record that has not been made part of the preceding
hearings.

The grievant may be represented by the Negotiations Unit
President or his designee. The Negotiations Unit may
designate an additional non-employee representative

If the decision involves a non-contractual grievance or if
the grievant has presented his appeal without Negotiations
Unit representation, the decision of the department head or
his designee shall be final and a copy of such decision
shall be sent to the Negotiations Unit.

Step Three Arbitration

In the event that the grievance has not been
satisfactorily resolved at Step Two, and the grievance
involves an alleged violation of the Agreement as
described in the definition of a grievance in A.1.
above, then a request for arbitration may be brought
only by the Negotiations Unit, through its designee,
within fifteen (15) calendar days from the day the
Negotiations Unit received the Step Two decision by
mailing a written request for arbitration to the

 

221
Director of the Office of Employee Relations. If
mutually agreed, a pre-arbitration conference may be
scheduled to frame the issue or issues. All
communications concerning appeals and decisions at
this Slep shall be made in writing. A request for
arbitration shall contain the names of the department
or agency and employee involved, copies of the
original grievance, appeal documents and written
decisions rendered at the lower steps of the grievance
procedure.

Within thirty (30) days of the execution of this
Agreement, the parties shall mutually agree upon a
panel of three (3) arbitrators. Each member of the
panel shall serve in turn. If a member of the panel
is unable to serve, the next member in sequence shall
then serve. In the event the parties are unable to
agree upon a panel of arbitrators within thirty (30)
days, arbitrators shall be selected, on a case-by-case
basis, under the selection procedure of the Public
Employment Relations Commission until such time as the
parties mutually agree upon a panel.

The arbitrator shall not have the power to add to
subtract from, or modify the provisions of this
Agreement or laws of the State, or any written policy
of the State or sub-division thereof and shall confine
his decision solely to the interpretation and
application of this Agreement. The arbitrator shall
confine himself to the precise issue submitted for
arbitration and shall have no authority to determine
any other issues not so submitted to him, nor shall he
submit observations or declaration of opinions which
are not relevant in reaching the determination. The
decision or award of the arbitrator shall be final and
binding consistent with applicable law and this
Agreement. In no event shall the same question or
issue be the subject of arbitration more than once

The arbitrator may prescribe an appropriate back pay
remedy when he finds a violation of this Agreement
provided such remedy is permitted by law and is
consistent with the terms of this Agreement. The
arbitrator shall have no authority to prescribe a
monetary award as a penalty for a violation of this
Agreement. Rules, regulations, formal policies or
orders of the State shall not be subject to revision
by the arbitrator except if specifically provided
herein. The fees and expenses of the arbitrator and
recording of the procedure shall be divided equally

222
 

between the parties. Any other cost of this proceeding
shall be borne by the party incurring the cost.

1, The arbitrator shall hold the hearing at a time and
place convenient to Lhe parties within thirty (30)
calendar days of his acceptance to act as arbitrator
and shall issue his decision within thirty (30) days
after the close of the hearing. In the event a
disagreement exists regarding the arbitrability of an
issue, the arbitrator shall make a preliminary
determination as to whether the issue is arbitrable
under the express terms of this Agreement. Once a
determination is made that such a dispute is
arbitrable, the arbitrator shall then proceed to
determine the merits of the dispute

2. Whenever a grievance which is to be resolved at Step
Three, Arbitration, is based on a provision of this
Agreement in which the power or authority of the
arbitrator is specifically limited, those limits shall
be observed and the provisions of paragraph three (3)
above shall be operable except and to the extent that
the limitations in such provisions modify such powers
or authority.

The State proposes the following language
Grievance Definition

by A “Contractual Grievance” is a claimed breach,
misinterpretation or improper application of the express
terms of this Agreement.

2. A “Non-Contractual Grievance” is a claimed violation
misinterpretation or misapplication of standard operating
procedures rules or regulations, or existing policies
administrative decisions, or laws applicable to the agency
or department which employs the grievant affecting the
terms and conditions of employment and which are not
included in A.1 above.

Purpose

The purpose of this procedure is to assure prompt and
equitable solutions of problems arising from the
administration of this Agreement, or other conditions of
employment by providing the exclusive vehicle for the
settlement of employee grievances.

Grievances shall only be filed by and processed
through the Lodge representation.

Scope of Grievance

1.

It is understood by the parties that this grievance
procedure represents the exclusive process for the
resolution of disputed matters arising out of the
grievances as defined above, except for those specific

matters listed below:

(a). Appeals of matters in dispute within the
jurisdiction of the Civil Service Commission
shall be made directly to the Civil Service
Commission subsequent to proper notification to

the responsible local management officials.

such

matters include but may not be limited to the

following subjects:

i.  Out-of-title work

ii. Position classification and re-evaluation

review

A claim of improper and unjust discipline against an
employee shall be processed in accordance with the
provisions of the contract regarding Discipline

Reference by name or title or otherwise in this

Agreement to laws, rules,
or orders of the State,

regulations, formal policies

shall not be construed as

bringing any allegation concerning the interpretation
or application of such matters within the scope of
arbitrability as set forth in this Agreement.

General Rules and Procedures

dE.

Where the subject of a grievance, or its emergent
nature, suggests it is appropriate, and where the

parties mutually agree

such grievance may be

initiated at or moved to any step of the procedure

224
without hearing at a lower step. Where the Lodge
requests a grievance be initiated at Step Two or
beyond based on a claim of emergency wherein the
normal processing of the grievance would prejudice the
effective relief sought or the substantive rights of
the grievant and, if such request is denied by the
agency of the State involved, the Lodge may seek an
expedited determination by the Office of Employee
Relations of the appropriate step to initiate such
grievance.

Where a grievance directly concerns and is shared by
more than one grievant, such group grievance may
properly be initiated at the first level of
supervision common to the several grievants, with the
mutual consent of the parties as to the appropriate
step. The presentation of such group grievance will
be by the appropriate Negotiations Unit
representative(s) and one of the affected grievants
designated by the Lodge. A group grievance may be
initiated only by the Lodge

Any member of the collective negotiations unit may
orally present and discuss a complaint with his/her
immediate supervisor on an informal basis but shall
not expand the time limits for filing a formal
grievance unless mutually agreed in writing

In the event that the grievance has not been
satisfactorily resolved on an informal basis, then an
appeal may be made on the grievance form specified
below.

All formal grievances shall be presented in writing to
the designated representative of the party against
whom it is made on “Grievance Forms” to be provided by
the State. Such forms shall make adequate provision
for the representative of each of the parties hereto
to maintain a written record of all action taken in
handling and disposing of the grievance at each step
of the Grievance Procedure. The form shall contain a
general description of the relevant facts from which
the grievance derives and references to the sections
of the Agreement, which the grievant claims to have
been violated. The grievance form must be completed
in its entirety. A group grievance initiated by the
Lodge may be presented on the above form, or where
appropriate, in another format provided that the
grievance is fully set forth in writing and contains

225
F.

all the information required on the official Grievance
Form.

When a grievance is initiated, the original Grievance
Forms shall be forwarded to the Personnel Officer of
the appropriate operating agency. After the grievance
is resolved copies shall be distributed as designated
on the Grievance Form.

A copy of the decision of the State at each step shall
be provided to the Lodge representative involved.

Grievance Time Limits and Management Response

5

 

A grievance must be filed initially within fifteen
(15) calendar days from the date on which the act
which is the subject of the grievance occurred or
fifteen (15) calendar days from the date on which the
grievant should reasonably have known of its
occurrence.

Where a grievance involves exclusively an alleged
error in calculation of salary payments, the grievance
may be timely filed within ninety (90) calendar days
of the time the individual should reasonably have
known of its occurrence.

Step One hearings shall be scheduled within ten (10)
calendar days of the initial receipt of the grievance.
The State’s decision shall be issued in writing to the
grievant and to the Lodge representative within ten
(10) days following conclusion of the Step One
hearing.

The Lodge shall have ten (10) calendar days from the
date the Step One Decision is issued to appeal the
grievance to Step Two. A Step Two hearing shall be
scheduled within fifteen (15) calendar days from the
date of the appeal of the Step One decision. The
State’s decision shall be issued in writing to the
grievant and to the Lodge representative within
fourteen (14) calendar days following conclusion of
the Step Two hearing.

Should a grievance not be satisfactorily resolved, or
should the State not respond within the prescribed
time periods, either after initial receipt of the
grievance or after a hearing, the grievance may be
appealed within ten (10) calendar days to the next

226
step. The lack of response by the State within the
prescribed time periods, unless time limits have been
extended by mutual agreement, should be construed as a
negative response.

6. When a grievance decision is rendered the decision
shall contain a notice informing the Lodge of the name
and position of the next higher level of management to
whom the appeal should be presented.

7. Time limits under this Article may be extended in
writing by mutual agreement and requests for
extensions of time limits will not be unreasonably
denied.

8. If, at any step in the grievance procedure, the
State’s decision is not appealed within the
appropriate prescribed time, such grievance will be
considered closed and there shall be no further appeal
or review.

9. No adjustment of any grievance shall impose
retroactivity beyond the date on which the grievance
was initiated or the fifteen (15) day period provided
in E.1. above except that payroll errors and related
matters shall be corrected to date of error within any
applicable statute of limitations.

Grievance Investigation - Time Off

When a grievance has been formally submitted in writing
and where the Lodge Representative or other officer
requires time to investigate such grievance to achieve an
understanding of the specific work problem during working
hours, the Representative or Officer will be granted
permission and reasonable time, to a limit of one (1) hour,
to investigate without loss of pay. It is understood that
the supervisor shall schedule such time release providing
the work responsibilities of the Representative or Officer
and of any involved employee are adequately covered and
providing further there is no disruption of work. Such
time release shall not be unreasonably withheld and upon
request could be extended beyond the one (1) hour limit for
specified reasons if, in the judgment of the supervisor,
the circumstances warrant an exception to this limit.

Where a Lodge Representative or other Officer serves a
grievance which the parties agree encompasses two (2) or
more geographically separated work locations and where the

227
circumstances require it, a supervisor shall authorize the
additional time required for travel.

Such time release shall not be construed to include
preparalion of paperwork, record keeping, conferences among
Lodge officials or preparation for presentation at a
grievance hearing.

Time Off for Grievance Hearings

1. An employee shall be allowed time off without loss of
pay:

(a). As may be required for appearance at a hearing of
the employee’s grievance scheduled during working
hours;

(b). For necessary travel time to and from the
Grievance hearing during working hours

2. Where the Lodge requests employee witnesses
permission for a reasonable number of witnesses
required during the grievance proceedings will be
granted. A witness at such proceedings will be
permitted to appear without loss of pay for the time
of appearance and travel time as required if during
his normal scheduled working hours.

3. | At Step One and beyond in the grievance procedure
witnesses may be heard and pertinent records received

4. The Lodge representative may have the right directly
to examine or cross-examine witnesses who appear at
any step of this procedure.

Grievance Steps and Parties Therein

Grievances shall be presented and adjusted in accordance
with the following procedures

Step One

If the grievance is not satisfactorily disposed of
informally, it may be filed with the Chief of Staff of the
Division of Criminal Justice or designee. The State
representative or his/her designee shall hear the
grievance, witnesses may be heard and pertinent records
received. The grievant may be represented by a Lodge
officer or fellow Negotiations Unit employee at the

228
institution or office involved. The circumstances
surrounding a grievance may suggest that the Lodge
President or a member of the Lodge’s Executive Board has a
particular need to assist in the presentation of the
grievance at Step One. He may make a request to do so to
the Office of Employee Relations. Such request shall not
be unreasonably denied

step Two

If the grievance is not satisfactorily disposed of at Step
One, it may be appealed to the Office of the Attorney
General which shall appoint a person to hear the appeal who
shall not be a person who was directly involved in the
grievance. The appeal shall be accompanied by the
decisions at the preceding level and any written record
that has not been made part of the preceding hearings

The grievant must be represented by the Negotiations Unit
President or his designee. The Lodge may designate an
alternate non-employee representative

If the decision involves a “Non-contractual Grievance”, the
decision of the Office of the Attorney General’s designee
shall be final and a copy of such decision shall be sent to
the Lodge.

Step Three Arbitration

1. In the event that a “Contractual Grievance” as defined
in A.1 has not been satisfactorily resolved at Step
Two, then a request for arbitration may be brought by
the Lodge or Lodge designee only within fifteen (15)
calendar days from the day the Lodge received the Step
Two decision. The written request must be by mailed to
the Director of the Office of Employee Relations. If
mutually agreed, a pre-arbitration conference may be
scheduled to frame the issue or issues. All
communications concerning appeals and decisions at
this Step shall be made in writing. A request for
arbitration shall contain the names of the department
or agency and employee involved copies of the original
grievance, appeal documents and written decisions
rendered at the lower steps of the grievance
procedure.

2. Within sixty (60) days of the execution of this

Agreement, the parties shall mutually agree upon a
panel of three (3) Arbitrators. All panel arbitrators

229
 

must agree, in writing and in advance as a condition
for being placed on the panel, to accept a fee of no
more than $1,000 per day, and to impose a fee of no
more than $500 for a late cancellation by either party
wilhoul good cause. Each member of the panel shall
serve in turn. If a member of the panel is unable to
serve the next member in sequence shall then serve

The arbitrator shall not have the power to add to,
subtract from, or modify the provisions of this
Agreement or laws of the State and shall confine
his/her decision solely to the interpretation and
application of this Agreement. The arbitrator shall
confine her/himself to the precise issue submitted for
arbitration and shall have no authority to determine
any other issues not so submitted, nor shall she/he
submit observations or declaration of opinions which
are not relevant in reaching the determination. The
decision or award of the arbitrator shall be final and
binding consistent with applicable law and this
Agreement. In no event shall the same question or
issue be the subject of arbitration more than once
The arbitrator may prescribe an appropriate back pay
remedy when she/he finds a violation of this
Agreement, provided such remedy is permitted by law
and is consistent with the terms of this Agreement.
The arbitrator shall have no authority to prescribe a
monetary award as a penalty for a violation of this
Agreement. The fees and expenses of the arbitrator
shall be divided equally between the parties. Any
other cost of this proceeding shall be borne by the
party incurring the cost. Any party ordering a
transcript shall bear the cost of the transcript,
however, if both parties want a copy of the
transcript, the cost of the transcript, including any
attendance fee, shall be shared equally between the
parties. Further, the cost of any transcript
including any attendance fee (or copy of any
transcript), requested by the Arbitrator, shall be
shared equally between the parties. Any other cost of
this proceeding shall be borne by the party incurring
the cost.

The arbitrator shall hold the hearing at a time and
place convenient to the parties within thirty (30)
calendar days of her/his acceptance to act as
arbitrator, or as soon thereafter as practicable, and
shall issue her/his decision within thirty (30) days
after the close of the hearing

230
5. Whenever a grievance which is to be resolved at Step
Three, Arbitration, is based on a provision of this
Agreement in which the power or authority of the
arbitrator is specifically limited, those limits shall
be observed and the provisions of paragraph three (3)
above shall be operable.

The FOP asserts that its grievance procedure is the same
that is included in the majority of the law enforcement
agreements with the State. The FOP asserts that the State’s
proposals seek to do nothing more than “pare down” the
contractual grievance rights of the FOP.

First, the parties are in agreement as to the definitions
of what a contractual grievance is as opposed to a non-
contractual grievance. However, under Paragraph B, which
defines the purpose of the grievance process, the divergence
between the parties proposals begin. Donlan testified that the
Union’s proposal would allow an individual grievant to file a
grievance on his/her own behalf but would not permit the
individual to arbitrate the grievance without the Union’s
authorization.

The FOP contends that paragraph B(3) accomplishes this
purpose and makes it clear that under no circumstances will the
FOP be compelled to bring a grievance to arbitration. This
language makes it unequivocally clear the FOP is the party that
possesses the exclusive power and authority to: (1) initiate a
grievance; (2) move the same from step to step; and (3) initiate

arbitration proceedings. Additionally, when reading the purpose

231
provisions comparatively together, it is clear the State has
conscientiously chosen to remove important language existing in
other grievance clauses which would place Lhe FOP’s members on
notice that they will not be retaliated against and/or suffer
any reprisal for initiating a grievance under the terms and
conditions of the collective negotiations agreement.

There are few differences between the parties’ proposals in
paragraph D, entitled, “General Rules and Procedures”. The
first paragraph of both the State and the FOP’s proposal
provides a vehicle to file an “emergent” grievance. In both
proposals, the State has the discretion to determine the
“emergent” nature of the grievance and thereby make a decision
if the emergent process articulated under this article is
followed. Where the proposals diverge, however, is that if the
State determines the grievance is not “emergent” as articulated
by the FOP, the process stops, whereas FOP’s proposal provides
an avenue to appeal the decision. If there is no process to
appeal a decision, the State will always have the power and
authority to reject a request made by the FOP.

The second major discrepancy in this paragraph pertains to
FOP’s proposal that resolutions and decisions at Step One and
Step Two of the grievance process shall not constitute a
precedent in any manner unless it is specifically agreed to by
the parties. Grievances are withdrawn and settled within the

three-step process for a myriad of reasons. For instance,

232
grievances are sometimes withdrawn and/or settled for issues
with timeliness, witness availability, or the proofs available
for consideration, The Union avers that common sense dictates
that such a decision to settle or withdraw a matter should not
be precedent setting.

Under paragraph G, the State is again attempting to remove
long-standing, accepted language that permits an employee to be
granted compensatory time off if a grievance hearing extends
beyond the confines of the normal work day. Again, this
provision of the proposal was taken directly from other State
law enforcement collective negotiation agreements the State
negotiated over a period of years. An employee should not be
forced to rush through the presentation of his/her evidence or
limit his/her ability to refute the State’s evidence because of
time constraints. Placing this language in the contract will
help prevent such a situation from occurring.

Next, the FOP does not object to designating the Chief of
Staff as being the receiving party for a grievance filed under
Step One of the process. Additionally, there is no objection to
the State Attorney General being named as the receiving party
for Step Two of the grievance process

The FOP takes issue with the State’s attempt to limit the
pool of arbitrators based on contractually-mandated fee
restrictions. All arbitrators do not hold the same level of

skill, expertise, and/or experience. Those arbitrators that

233
have a higher level of skill, expertise, and experience will
charges rates that exceed $1,000 per day. The FOP is willing to
pay for Lhese services.

The FOP argues that its proposal is superior, as the
language contained in the same has been tested over many years
within the bodies of the other State law enforcement collective
negotiations agreements. Conversely, the State’s attempts to
modify the long-standing language does nothing more than
restrict and/or extinguish the detective’s rights.

The State argues that its proposed grievance procedure
where it differs from the Union’s, reflects a conscious effort
to develop a process that dovetails with the operations of the
Division and eliminates vague and redundant language.

The State urges the Arbitrator to adopt the State’s proposal as
written. In paragraph A(1), the State proposal limits
“contractual grievances” to “express terms” which is an
appropriate clarification of the parties’ intent to distinguish
between those disputes that may proceed to arbitration and those
which will not. In paragraph B(1), the State objects to the
Union’s attempt to absolve itself of any responsibility for
processing meritless grievances while simultaneously requiring
the State to process such grievances. The State’s position is a
matter of fairness. If the Union determines that a grievance
lacks merit such that it chooses not to be involved, the

grievance should not proceed. In paragraph B(2), the State

234
objects to this proposal as it merely reiterates the State’s
legal obligation. The second sentence is redundant to the
“General Rules and Procedural language.” In paragraph B(4)
Agreements between the Union Representatives and the State
Representatives should stand on their own. If a grievance
settlement is reached it should not be subject to attack because
it is alleged to modify the terms of the Agreement. on
occasion, grievance resolution may do exactly that. In
paragraph C(1) (a), the State and the Union disagree on the
subjects that are available to appeal to CSC (as shown below).
The State’s language: “Such matters shall include, but not be
limited to the following topics,” provides the appropriate
flexibility to address any concern the Union may have that the
State’s list of subjects that can be appealed to CSC is not
exhaustive. In paragraph C(a) (3) and (4), the State asserts
that the topics the Union lists do not apply to unclassified
employees. In paragraph C(b), the State claims the Union's
proposal is an attempt to summarize the law as it relates to
negotiable subjects of bargain. The language does not add
anything useful to the Agreement; however, given the language’s
incomplete and misleading recitation of the scope of
negotiations, its inclusion only could result in confusion and
unintended results. In paragraph D(1), the Union’s proposal to
arbitrate whether a grievance should be expedited is not

efficient as it would result in an arbitration over when to have

235
an arbitration. In paragraph D(3), the proposals are
substantially similar. However, the State contends that its
proposal appropriately makes clear that an informal discussion
does not expand the time limits for filing a grievance. As
stated throughout the State’s proposal, any extension of the
time periods must be in writing to avoid the inevitable disputes
over whether an extension had been agreed to between the
parties. In paragraph D(7), the Union proposed that there be a
contractual prohibition against grievance resolutions or
decisions having precedential value. Such a blanket prohibition
is not warranted. During the course of contract administration
grievances will be filed; decisions issued and resolutions
reached. Each such decision and resolution should stand on its
own merits and either party should be free to argue the
precedential value in any given circumstance. In paragraph
E(1), the Union’s proposal provides for “relaxed” deadlines for
filing grievances in the case of a continuing violation. The
Employer argues that the proposal is vague and attempts to
grossly expand the equitable doctrine of “continuing
violations.” Such an expansion would render the time limits in
the process meaningless in many circumstances. In paragraph
£(3)/E(4) and (5), the State submits that its proposal
concerning the hearing schedules is clearer and less cumbersome
than the Union’s proposal which, as written, provides no limit

on when a hearing must be scheduled. In paragraph E(5) and (6)

236
the Union's proposal requiring the State to inform the grievant
of the next higher level of management “when a grievance appeal
is to be filed,” is nonsensical. The State’s proposal places
the burden on the State to provide the information to the
grievant with the issuance of the decision. In paragraph (7)
the State insists that the agreements to extend time be in
writing. The State’s proposal is categorically reasonable.

In paragraph E(8)/(9), the State appropriately proposes
that the retroactivity not be entirely open-ended. The State’s
proposal to limit retroactivity to applicable statutes of
limitation, is fair and in compliance with the law. In
paragraph G(b), the State contends the employees should be “held
harmless” in terms of compensation for attending grievance
hearings. The Union’s proposal essentially provides extra
compensation beyond what an employee would receive had he or she
been on duty. In paragraph H, Step One, the State proposes that
grievances be filed with the Chief of Staff. The State’s
proposal eliminates the possibility of confusion. The Chief of
Staff can then refer the grievance to appropriate management
personnel for response. In paragraph H, Step Two, the State’s
proposal to have Step Two grievance filed with the Attorney
General's office will eliminate the possibility of confusion or
misdirection of the grievance. In paragraph H, Step Three (2)
the Union and the State disagree on two points. The State

proposes a sixty-day window to settle on a panel of three

237
arbitrators. Thirty days after the start of a new agreement
simply is too short a period of time. The State proposed the
cost containment measures of empaneling arbitrators who will
agree to a $1,000 ceiling. The cost containment provision is
contained in every law enforcement contract that was negotiated
or awarded in the last contract cycle. In paragraph H, Step
Three (3), the Union proposes that the following caveat be added
to the section defining the arbitrator’s authority: “Rules,
regulations or orders of the State shall not be subject to
revision by the arbitrator except as provided herein.” There is
no provision in the agreement that would give the arbitrator the
authority to modify rules, regulations or State orders - nor
should there be one. In addition, the parties disagree over the
State's proposal to insert clearer language regarding the costs
for ordering transcripts. In H, Step Three (4), the State
proposes to add the phrase “or as soon thereafter as

practicable” to the timeframe in which to hold a hearing

entirety.

Generally, the State’s proposed language is adopted,

beginning with paragraphs A and B, except that 1 add “unless the

238
Negotiations Unit provides specific permission to the contrary”
to the end of B. 2. The Union should be able to decide to
permit individual employees Lo pursue grievances on their own.
The State’s version more succinctly captures the essence of the
provisions. I further find unnecessary proposals (B. 2) that
restate the State’s legal obligation, thus, the “no reprisals”
language is not awarded.

However, I approve the ability of individuals to pursue
their grievances up to arbitration. I do not agree with the
contention that if the Union determines that a grievance lacks
merit such that it chooses not to be involved, the grievance
should not proceed. Acknowledging that this is a contract
between the Union and the State, the individual employees are
also beneficiaries and have interests at stake to defend

I agree that where a grievance settlement is reached it
should not be subject to attack because it is alleged to modify
the terms of the Agreement and that on occasion, grievance
resolution may do exactly that. Thus, the Union’s paragraphs B
1 through 5 are collapsed or eliminated,

I award the State’s paragraph C and concur that paragraphs
C.l.a. #3, 4, and 5 do not apply to the FOP’s unit employees
Certain other language is excised because it is less concise and
I believe that a comprehensive listing of items that may be
appealed to Civil service Commission (in C.1.a.1 and 2. is not

necessary or prudent. A minimal list for the informational

239
benefit of unit members is best. The Civil Service Commission
or the Courts will be the ultimate arbiter of that commission's
jurisdiction.

I agree with the State’s criticism of the Union’s proposed
language in section C. 1. b. - that it attempts to concisely
reference or define arbitrability for this contract, but cannot
do this well and will likely mislead or lead to
misunderstandings. It does not add to the overall purposes of
the grievance procedure. It would be impossible to concisely
explain arbitrability in a collective agreement

and 3. are awarded.

 

Paragraphs C.

I award the State’s paragraph D, paragraph 1. and agree
that the Union’s proposal to arbitrate whether a grievance
should be expedited is not efficient and would result in an
arbitration over when to have an arbitration. It is possible
and may be likely that an arbitrator could not render a decision
regarding the timing of an arbitration prior to the exhaustion
of the grievance process.

I award the State’s paragraph D, paragraphs 2. And 3, and
agree that the State’s proposal makes explicit that an informal
discussion does not expand the time limits for filing a
grievance and that mutually-agreed upon extensions must be
obtained in writing. This may avoid future disputes.

I award paragraph s D. 4, 5 and 6, as the parties concur on

these.

240
The State objects to the FOP’s proposed D. 7. The Union
proposed that there be a contractual prohibition against
grievance resolutions or decisions having precedential value. I
agree that such a blanket prohibition is not warranted. During
the course of contract administration, grievances will be filed,
decisions issued and resolutions reached. Each such decision
and resolution should stand on its own merits and either party
should be free to argue the precedential value in any given
circumstance.

In paragraph E.1., the FOP proposed “relaxed” deadlines for
filing grievances in cases of alleged continuing violations.

The State objects to the proposal. I agree that the proposal is
vague, and concerns a legal doctrine over much many cases have
been litigated. The Union did not support this language and I
decline to award it.

I also award paragraph E 2, which the parties agree to.

The State objects to the Union’s proposed B. 3. (a) and (b
and E.4. These provisions set time limits for issuing decisions

and moving the grievance forward. Since the FOP has not

 

provided any support for its proposal, I award the State’s BE.
and E.4., as they are more simply drafted. Similarly, I award
E.5 through 9, as the differences are minor

Paragraph F is awarded.

Paragraph G is awarded, without compensatory time for

grievance hearings that last longer than the workday. The State

241
argues that the Union’s proposal provides extra compensation
beyond what an employee would receive had he or she been on
duty. The Union objects to the State’s alleged attempt to
remove this long-standing language. There is insufficient
evidence in the record to support this provision, and it is not
included.

Paragraph H

The State’s proposed version of Paragraph H Steps One and
Two are awarded. The State proposes that the contract direct
that grievances at Step One be filed with the Chief of Staff to
avoid confusion. The Chief of Staff can then refer the
grievance to appropriate management personnel for response.

In Step Three, “Arbitration,” the Union and the State disagree
on two (2) points: the State proposes a sixty (60) day window to
settle on a panel of three (3) arbitrators. It argues the
Union’s proposed thirty (30) days after the start of a new
agreement is too short a period of time. I award this longer
timeframe,

Second, the State proposed the cost containment measures of
impaneling arbitrators who will agree to a $1,000.00 ceiling
The cost containment provision is contained in every law
enforcement contract that was negotiated or awarded in the last
contract cycle - including, NJLESA, FOP Union 174, PBA Local
105, NJSOLEA, PBA SLEU and NJLECOA. F.0.P. #91 views the

$1000.00 rate as limiting the pool of willing and qualitied

242
arbitrators. It contends all arbitrators are not as experienced
or skilled as more experienced ones who tend to charge more
F.0.D. #91 asserts it is willing to pay for these higher level
services.

The proposed rate - $1000.00 - is too low and I do not
award it because the parties already agree that they may use the
procedures of the PERC grievance arbitration panel, I award
those rates, set by individual arbitrators. Under the PERC
grievance arbitration panel, arbitrators set their own rates.

The Union proposes that the following caveat be added to
the section defining the arbitrator’s authority: “Rules
regulations or orders of the State shall not be subject to
revision by the arbitrator except as provided herein.” The
State argues and I concur that there is no other provision in
the agreement that gives an arbitrator the authority to modify
rules, regulations or State orders and there should not be one

The State suggests inserting of clearer language regarding
the allocation of costs for ordering transcripts. Finally, the
State proposes to add “or as soon thereafter as practicable” to
the timeframe in which to hold a hearing. These provisions are
also awarded.

The Union proposed language authorizing an arbitrator to
decide the arbitrability of subjects in dispute but I do not
award this language. The Commission determines arbitrabilty

through its scope of negotiations authority and procedures.

243
 

I award the following language for the grievance procedur

Grievance Definition

i. A “Contractual Grievance” is a claimed breach,
misinterpretation or improper application of the
express terms of this Agreement.

2. A “Non-Contractual Grievance” is a claimed
violation, misinterpretation or misapplication of
standard operating procedures rules or regulations, or
existing policies, administrative decisions, letters
or memoranda of agreement, or laws applicable to the
agency or department which employs the grievant
affecting the terms and conditions of employment and
which are not included in A.1 above

Purpose

The purpose of this procedure is to assure prompt and
equitable solutions of problems arising from the
administration of this Agreement, or other conditions
of employment by providing the exclusive vehicle for
the settlement of employee grievances.

7. Nothing in this Agreement shall be construed as
compelling the submission of a grievance to
arbitration. The Lodge’s decision to request the
movement of any grievance at any step or to terminate
the grievance at any step shall be final as to the
interests of the grievant and the Lodge.

2. Where an individual grievant initiates a
Grievance, such Grievances shall only be filed by and
processed through the Lodge representation, unless the
Negotiations Unit provides specific permission to the
contrary.

Scope of Grievance Procedure

1. It is understood by the parties that this
grievance procedure represents the exclusive process
for the resolution of disputed matters arising out of
the grievances as defined above, except for those
specific matters listed below:

244
(a). Appeals of matters in dispute within the
jurisdiction of the Civil Service Commission shall be
made directly to the Civil Service Commission
subsequent to proper notification to the responsible
local management officials. Such matters include but
may not be limited to the following subjects

.  Qut-of-title work
ii. Position classification and re-evaluation

2. A claim of improper and unjust discipline
against an employee shall be processed in accordance
with the Discipline provisions of the contract

3. Reference by name or title or otherwise in this
Agreement to laws, rules, regulations, formal policies
or orders of the State, shall not be construed as
bringing any allegation concerning the interpretation
or application of such matters within the scope of
arbitrability as set forth in this Agreement.

General Rules and Procedure

1. Where the subject of a grievance, or its emergent
nature, suggests it is appropriate, and where the
parties mutually agree, such grievance may be
initiated at or moved to any step of the procedure
without hearing at a lower step.

Where the Lodge requests a grievance be initiated at
Step Two or beyond based on a claim of emergency
wherein the normal processing of the grievance would
prejudice the effective relief sought or the
substantive rights of the grievant and, if such
request is denied by the agency of the State involved,
the Lodge may seek an expedited determination by the
Office of Employee Relations of the appropriate step
to initiate such grievance

2. Where a grievance directly concerns and is shared
by more than one grievant, such group grievance may
properly be initiated at the first level of
supervision common to the several grievants, with the
mutual consent of the parties as to the appropriate

245
step. The presentation of such group grievance will
be by the appropriate Negotiations Unit
representative(s) and one of the affected grievants
designated by the Lodge. A group grievance may be
initiated only by the Lodge.

3. Any member of the collective negotiations unit
may orally present and discuss a complaint with
his/her immediate supervisor on an informal basis but
shall not expand the time limits for filing a formal
grievance unless mutually agreed in writing

4, In the event that the grievance has not been
satisfactorily resolved on an informal basis, then an
appeal may be made on the grievance form specified
below.

5. All formal grievances shall be presented in
writing to the designated representative of the party
against whom it is made on “Grievance Forms” to be
provided by the State. Such forms shall make adequate
provision for the representative of each of the
parties hereto to maintain a written record of all
action taken in handling and disposing of the
grievance at each step of the Grievance Procedure

The form shall contain a general description of the
relevant facts from which the grievance derives and
references to the sections of the Agreement, which the
grievant claims to have been violated. The grievance
form must be completed in its entirety. A group
grievance initiated by the Lodge may be presented on
the above form, or where appropriate, in another
format provided that the grievance is fully set forth
in writing and contains all the information required
on the official Grievance Form.

6. When a grievance is initiated, the original
Grievance Forms shall be forwarded to the Personnel
Officer of the appropriate operating agency. After
the grievance is resolved copies shall be distributed
as designated on the Grievance Form.

A copy of the decision of the State at each step
shall be provided to the Lodge representative
involved.

E. Grievance Time Limits and Management Response

246
1. A grievance must be filed initially within
fifteen (15) calendar days from the date on which the
act which is the subject of the grievance occurred or
fifteen (15) calendar days from the date on which the
grievant should reasonably have known of its
occurrence.

2. Where a grievance involves exclusively an alleged
error in calculation of salary payments, the grievance
may be timely filed within ninety (90) calendar days
of the time the individual should reasonably have
known of its occurrence.

3. Step One hearings shall be scheduled within ten
(10) calendar days of the initial receipt of the
grievance. The State’s decision shall be issued in
writing to the grievant and to the Lodge
representative within ten (10) days following
conclusion of the Step One hearing

 

4. The Lodge shall have ten (10) calendar days from
the date the Step One Decision is issued to appeal the
grievance to Step Two. A Step Two hearing shall be
scheduled within fifteen (15) calendar days from the
date of the appeal of the Step One decision. The
State’s decision shall be issued in writing to the
grievant and to the Lodge representative within
fourteen (14) calendar days following conclusion of
the Step Two hearing.

5. Should a grievance not be satisfactorily
resolved, or should the State not respond within the
prescribed time periods, either after initial receipt
of the grievance or after a hearing, the grievance may
be appealed within ten (10) calendar days to the next
step. The lack of response by the State within the
prescribed time periods, unless time limits have been
extended by mutual agreement, should be construed as a
negative response.

6. When a grievance decision is rendered the
decision shall contain a notice informing the Lodge of
the name and position of the next higher level of
management to whom the appeal should be presented

7. Time limits under this Article may be extended in
writing by mutual agreement and requests for
extensions of time limits will not be unreasonably
denied.

247
8. If, at any step in the grievance procedure, the
State’s decision is not appealed within the
appropriate prescribed time, such grievance will be
considered closed and there shall be no further appeal
or review.

9. No adjustment of any grievance shall impose
retroactivity beyond the date on which the grievance
was initiated or the fifteen (15) day period provided
in E.1. above except that payroll errors and related
matters shall be corrected to date of error within any
applicable statute of limitations

(not awarded)
(not awarded)

Grievance Steps and Parties Therein

Grievances shall be presented and adjusted in accordance with
the following procedures

Step One

If the grievance is not satisfactorily disposed of
informally, it may be filed with the Chief of Staff
of the Division of Criminal Justice or designee. The
State representative or his/her designee shall hear
the grievance, witnesses may be heard and pertinent
records received. The grievant may be represented
by a Lodge officer or fellow Negotiations Unit
employee at the institution or office involved. The
circumstances surrounding a grievance may suggest
that the Lodge President or a member of the Lodge's
Executive Board has a particular need to assist in
the presentation of the grievance at Step One. He
may make a request to do so to the Office of
Employee Relations. Such request shall not be
unreasonably denied.

Step Two

If the grievance is not satisfactorily disposed of
at Step One, it may be appealed to the Office of the
Attorney General which shall appoint a person to
hear the appeal who shall not be a person who was
directly involved in the grievance. The appeal

248
shall be accompanied by the decisions at the
preceding level and any written record that has not
been made part of the preceding hearings.

The gricvant must be represented by the Negotiations
Unit President or his designee. The Lodge may
designate an alternate non-employee representative

If the decision involves a “Non-contractual
Grievance”, the decision of the Office of the

Attorney General’s designee shall be final and a
copy of such decision shall be sent to the Lodge.

Step Three Arbitration

1. In the event that a “Contractual Grievance” as
defined in A.1 has not been satisfactorily resolved
at Step Two, then a request for arbitration may be
brought by the Lodge or Lodge designee only within
fifteen (15) calendar days from the day the Lodge
received the Step Two decision. The written
request must be by mailed to the Director of the
Office of Employee Relations. If mutually agreed,
a pre-arbitration conference may be scheduled to
frame the issue or issues. All communications
concerning appeals and decisions at this Step shall
be made in writing. A request for arbitration
shall contain the names of the department or agency
and employee involved copies of the original
grievance, appeal documents and written decisions
rendered at the lower steps of the grievance
procedure.

2. Within sixty (60) days of the execution of this
Agreement, the parties shall mutually agree upon a
panel of three (3) Arbitrators. Panel Arbitrators
will be paid their normal daily rates. Each member
of the panel shall serve in turn. If a member of
the panel is unable to serve the next member in
sequence shall then serve

3. The arbitrator shall confine his/her decision
solely to the interpretation and application of
this Agreement. The arbitrator shall confine
her/himself to the precise issue submitted for
arbitration and shall have no authority to
determine any other issues not so submitted, nor
shall she/he submit observations or declaration of
opinions which are not relevant in reaching the

249
determination. The decision or award of the
arbitrator shall be final and binding consistent
with applicable law and this Agreement. In no
event shall the same question or issue be the
subject of arbitration more than once. The
arbitrator may prescribe an appropriate back pay
remedy when she/he finds a violation of this
Agreement, provided such remedy is permitted by law
and is consistent with the terms of this Agreement.
The arbitrator shall have no authority to prescribe
a monetary award as a penalty for a violation of
this Agreement. The fees and expenses of the
arbitrator shall be divided equally between the
parties. Any other cost of this proceeding shall
be borne by the party incurring the cost. Any
party ordering a transcript shall bear the cost of
the transcript, however, if both parties want a
copy of the transcript, the cost of the transcript,
including any attendance fee, shall be shared
equally between the parties. Further, the cost of
any transcript, including any attendance fee (or
copy of any transcript), requested by the
Arbitrator, shall be shared equally between the
parties.

4, The arbitrator shall hold the hearing at a time
and place convenient to the parties as soon as
practical after of her/his appointment to act as
arbitrator, and shall issue her/his decision within
thirty (30) days after the close of the hearing

5. Whenever a grievance which is to be resolved at
Step Three, Arbitration, is based on a provision of
this Agreement in which the power or authority of
the arbitrator is specifically limited, those
limits shall be observed and the provisions of
paragraph three (3) above shall be operable

PROMOTIONS :
The Union’s proposal provides:

A promoted candidate and the Lodge shall receive a
written notification of the promotion which will
include the new rank and rate of pay within one week
after promotion, and shall within ten days of the
effective date of the promotion, assume the vacant
position for which the promotion was announced,
subject to overriding operational requirements.

250
The State proposed an alternate version
A promoted candidate and the Lodge shall receive a
written notification of the promotion which will
include the new rank, rate of pay, effective date and
start date. Within ten (10) days of the designated
start date, the employee shall assume the vacant
position for which the promotion was announced,
subject to overriding operational requirements

Miller provided uncontroverted testimony as to the process
for the promotion of Detectives to Sergeant or Lieutenant,
including the approval process required for those promotions.
(ST-66-70). First, notice of a promotional opportunity is
posted.” Responsive resumes are reviewed and qualified
applicants interviewed. Miller, the Chief of Detectives, and
the DCJ Director select the individual(s) to be promoted. The
Deg then must obtain approval, in succession, from three
offices: (1) the Office of the Attorney General; (2) the
Governor’s Office; (3) the Civil Service Commission.

Upon the CSC’s approval, a representative of the CSC sends
the promotional paperwork to the DCJ. That paperwork indicated
the “effective date” of the promotion. It is on the “effective
date” that the employee assumes the higher rank and pay.
However, the employee’s “start date” may not be the same as her
“effective date”. Miller explained that the detective might be
in the middle of an assignment and there might be some

operational need that would delay the employee’s actual start

© The criteria for the promotion is taken “directly from the [Civil Service
Commission] job specitication” and listed in the posting, as required. (Tr.
10/31/14, p. 96-97, 99(Miller)).

251
date in his/her new rank. Additionally, if the promoted
employee is accepting the new assignment at a different facility
the employee has to be moved to the new facility

The State contends that its proposal takes into account the
practical and logistic realities of the entire promotion
process, ensuring that the promoted detective will actually
assume his/her position within ten days of the designated start
date. The Union’s proposal, on the other hand, poses a
logistical conundrum. The Union’s proposal provides that the
promoted candidate “receive written notification of the
promotion . . . within one week after the promotion.” The State
argues that the Union’s witnesses have failed to explain how and
why the State would wait until one week post-promotion to advise
a detective that he’s been promoted. For the foregoing reasons,
the State urges that its proposal be awarded

I find that the Union’s proposal requiring notice to the
candidate and to the Union within ten days to be unnecessary
However, the Union's language which would require a start date
within ten days of the effective date, is completely compatible
with the Division’s current practice as explained by Miller
This is particularly true since it also provides for an
exception if operational needs dictate otherwise. I award the
following language:

A. A promoted candidate and the Lodge shall receive a
written notification of the promotion which will

252
include the new rank, rate of pay, effective date and
start date. Within ten (10) days of the effective
date, the employee shall assume the vacant position
for which the promotion was announced, subject to
overriding operational requirements.

TRANSFERS
The Union proposes the following contract language
A. No employee shall be transferred on less than ten
(10) days’ notice to the employee of the proposed
transfer, but this specific requirement does not apply
to emergency assignments
B. Arbitration of the provisions of this clause is
limited to the procedural aspects only with the
exception of when it is alleged that a transfer was
made for disciplinary reasons.
E. Once a year, beginning in July 2011, employees
shall be permitted to request a transfer by submitting
a request to the Chief or his designee
G. An employee may submit a transfer for
extraordinary reasons at any time to the Chief
detailing the extraordinary reasons for a transfer
The State proposes:
H. Arbitration of the provisions of this clause is
limited to the procedural aspects only. The
Division’s decision on whether to transfer an employee
shall not be subject to arbitration.
I. Employees shall be permitted to request a transfer
by submitting a request to the Chief or his designee
(Modification of Union’s Item *F”]
The FOP notes that under the proposed Article entitled
“Transfers,” there are four paragraphs the parties disagree
about. First, under Paragraph C., the FOP proposes that, if a

transfer is effectuated, the member being transferred be

afforded a total of ten days’ notice prior to the same going

253
into effect unless the transfer is deemed an emergency by
management. There are three primary locations where detectives
work and most detectives are assigned to a geographical location
that is close to their residence. The Union argues that
providing the detective with ten days’ notice, when possible, to
ensure that his/her personal life is in order is not only
reasonable in this instance but warranted as a matter of human
decency.

The Union contends that paragraph F will permit the
detectives to request to be transferred once a year. Second
paragraph G permits an FOP unit member to request a transfer at
any time for extraordinary reasons so long as the same are
detailed in the request. It must be noted that under both
paragraphs, there are no guarantees the transfers will be
effectuated. Therefore, other than the fact that the transfer
requests may take a minimum amount of administrative time for
the Chief of Detectives and his staff to consider, there is no
plausible reason offered by the State as to why these proposals
should be rejected.

Paragraph E allows the FOP to grieve the procedural aspects
of the transfer proposal, with the exception of providing FOP
the ability to grieve a disciplinary transfer. The Union
acknowledges that the Employer has a managerial prerogative to
transfer employees for operational needs. Therefore, the Union

does not seek the ability to grieve the reasoning behind a

254
transfer, Nevertheless, the procedural aspects pertaining to
how an employee may be transferred is a negotiable topic. Based
upon this, there should be no reason the procedural aspects of
how an employee is transferred should not be subject to the
grievance procedures of the collective negotiations agreement.

Finally, Donlan testified that detectives have been
transferred in the past for disciplinary reasons. (1T-131) In
particular, Donlan testified Detective Jim Sweeney was
involuntarily transferred from the Northern Unit in Whippany to
the evidence facility in Hamilton. This resulted in a two-hour
commute each way for Sweeney. The transfer was in response to
an alleged incident the State ultimately determined required
discipline. In fact, shortly after the transfer was
effectuated, Sweeney was terminated from employment.

Both the State and FOP have proposed the penalties that may
be imposed for discipline. In both instances, neither the State
nor the FOP proposed that transferring an employee as an
acceptable penalty for a disciplinary offense. Based on the
foregoing and given the severe implications a transfer can have

upon the life of a detective, if the transfer can be linked

 

directly to a disciplinary action, FOP is requesting the right
to contest such a transfer by grieving the same. If this
paragraph is excluded from the collective negotiations

agreement, the State will have the unfettered ability to bypass

255
the disciplinary process and transfer an individual for
disciplinary reasons, without the same able to be challenged
The State argues that it has a non-negotiable prerogative
to transfer, assign or reassign its employees to meet its
governmental policy goal of matching the best qualified employee
to a particular job and, thus, cannot be subject to review by an

arbitrator. See e.g., Ocean Tp. Superior Officers Ass'n,

 

P.E.R.C. No. 93-13, 18 NJPER, 198, (423 1992). To create an
exception to those well-established principles any time an
employee characterizes the decision to transfer as
“disciplinary,” would eviscerate the DCJ’s managerial right to
transfer employees as such decisions inevitably would be subject
to arbitral review under the guise of “discipline.” Teaneck Bd.

Of Education v. Teaneck Teachers Assoc., 94 N.J. at 15 (1983)

 

(recognizing that allowing an exception for claims of
discrimination to the general rule that transfer decisions
cannot be subject to arbitration would impermissibly infringe on
a public employer's managerial prerogative to transfer). For
these reasons, the FOP’s proposal to permit the arbitration of
transfers in any circumstance is outside the scope of
negotiations and must be rejected.

I find the Union’s argument on the ten-day advance notice
of a transfer is persuasive, especially since the locations of
the Division's offices are far from each other. The State need

not give ten days’ notice where an emergent need arises.

256
I find the Union's arguments supporting its proposed right
to appeal a “disciplinary” transfer also persuasive. The
State’s assertion that submitting such allegations to
arbitration would “eviscerate” its right to transfer employees
and that challenges would be inevitable are not supported by
any evidence. One obvious safeguard to these circumstances is
the fact that the Union has to prove a transfer was
disciplinary. Further, that there is in New Jersey a public

policy disfavoring transfers for disciplinary reasons in

Ri

  

public employment is suggested by the amendments to

34:13A-25 that states:

“Transfers of employees by employers between work

sites shall not be mandatorily negotiable except that

no employer shall transfer an employee for

disciplinary reasons.”

Finally, PERC did not agree with the State that the
submission of any discipline to binding arbitration “has no
place” where unclassified employees are concerned. It found
mandatorily negotiable proposals allowing the arbitration of
minor discipline. State of New Jersey, P.E.R.C. No. 2014-50

I find the remaining paragraphs merely afford employees the

right to request transfers and I award them with slight

modifications.

 

I award the following:
A. No employee shall be transferred on less than ten
(10) days’ notice to the employee of the proposed
transfer, but this specific requirement does not apply
to emergency assignments

257
B. Arbitration of the provisions of this clause is
limited to the procedural aspects only with the
exception of when it is alleged that a transfer was
made for disciplinary reasons.

E. Employees shall be permitted to request a transfer
by submitting a request to the Chief of Staff or his
designee stating the reasons for the transfer request.

OUTSIDE WORK
The Union proposes:

A. An employee serving in the title of Detective may
engage in outside employment with prior approval from the
Chief. Outside employment in the security field, including,
but not limited to, work as a security officer shall be
permitted.

B. An employee serving in the title of Detective desiring
to engage in outside employment shall request permission in
writing from the Chief of Detectives. Approval or
disapproval of such requests shall be transmitted within
fourteen (14) calendar days thereafter

C. It is understood that outside employment shall in no
way interfere with the efficient operation of the Division
of Criminal Justice and the absolute priority of the
Detective's responsibility to assignments in his/her work
as a Detective.

D. Any grievance under this Article shall be submitted

directly to the Chief of Detectives, and if not resolved

may be submitted as an A.1 grievance under Article of
this Agreement.

The Union argues that it is seeking to codify the current
practice utilized by the Division with regard to detectives
engaging in outside employment. To this end, the FOP submitted
SOP #10, entitled “Restrictions on and Requests for Outside

Employment by State Investigators.” (FOP-34

258
The Union argues that its proposal permits a detective to
engage in outside employment so long as the prior approvals are
obtained. The proposal comprehensively sets forth the mechanism
to obtain such approval and explicitly indicates that such
outside employment shall in no way interfere with a Detective’s
duties with the Division of Criminal Justice. Lastly, the
proposal mandates that a Detective’s responsibilities to the

Division of Criminal Justice remain paramount

  

The State asserts that, pursuant to 13D-12, et

 

seq. and N. 19:61-1.1., et seq. its SOP, in place since
1993 and titled “Restrictions on and Requests for Outside
Employment by State Investigators,” prohibits, with good reason,
outside employment of detectives in certain fields of work
including “private investigative and security work.” The
Union’s proposal would rescind that restriction and subject
denials of requests for outside employment to review of a third-
party arbitrator. That change is significant, potentially
detrimental to the DSJ and its detectives and affords no
recognition of the requirement and limitations set forth in the
governing conflict of interest laws referenced above

As the SOP states, detectives are not permitted to engage
in “any employment which may impair his/her objectivity and
independence of judgment or create an appearance of impropriety
or conflict of interest,” or to “engage in any business

transaction, or protessional activity, which is in conflict with

259
the proper discharge of his/her duties.” Morris summed up the

 

State’s objections to Union’s proposa.

@: The Union has a proposal that would require that
you as a Chief not have a blanket prohibition on their
performance of outside security work. What do you
think about that proposal?

A: I think it's going to create a lot of problems as
far as conflict of interest. I can see somebody
wanting to do security work perhaps as a bodyguard or
perhaps at an establishment that serves alcohol or
perhaps for an individual that [has an] extensive
background in their actual activities would have to be
done in order to approve it and it would create a

problem.
Q: What do you mean it would create a problem?
A: Because the individual may actually be doing

something that we're investigating in an area that
particular Detective doesn't know about and by telling
them that he couldn't do it, it would raise a red flag
for that particular individual

Q: The Unit's proposal also provides that any of
your denials of requests to perform outside work would
be subject to the grievance and arbitration procedure
of the agreement. Do you have any issues with that?

 

Sure do. I'd have to start disclosing confidential
investigations to third parties about why I denied the
request. (5T-133-134)

Thus, the State argues that DCJ’s strict prohibition on
outside employment in security must be maintained for the
integrity of the DCJ and its investigations. As such, Union's
proposal must be rejected.

I find that the proposal is awarded in part and denied in

part. To the extent the proposal represents a change in the SOP

of the parties, it is denied.

260
N.J.S.A. 5:

 

30-12, provides:

(a) In our representative form of government, it is
essential that the conduct of public officials and
employees shall hold the respect and confidence of the
people. Public officials must, therefore, avoid
conduct which is in violation of their public trust or
which creates a justifiable impression among the
public that such trust is being violated.

(b) To ensure propriety and preserve public
confidence, persons serving in government should have
the benefit of specific standards to guide their
conduct and of some disciplinary mechanism to ensure
the uniform maintenance of those standards amongst
them. Some standards of this type may be enacted as
general statutory prohibitions or requirements
others, because of complexity and variety of
circumstances, are best left to the governance of
codes of ethics formulated to meet the specific needs
and conditions of the several agencies of government.

(c) It is also recognized that under a free government
it is both necessary and desirable that all citizens
public officials included, should have certain

specific interests in the decisions of government, and

that the activities and conduct of public officials

should not, therefore, be unduly circumscribed

L.1971, c. 182, s. 1, eff. Jan. 11, 1972.

In line with the concepts set forth in the legislative
intent statement above, I find that the prohibition on outside
employment in “private investigative and security work” should
remain because the likelihood that security work would create
the possibility of conflicts of interest between detectives’
official responsibilities and the outside work is high
Further, there is a risk of the potential appearance of a

conflict of interest between the Division’s official business

and the outside security work. Thus, the sentence: “Outside

261
employment in the security field, including, but not limited to,
work as a security officer shall be permitted” is excised from
the provision.

The other issue is whether submitting disputes over
disapprovals of particular outside employment requests may be
arbitrated. I agree with the Division that because of the
sensitive nature of its work, it should not be compelled to
reveal to outside parties the subjects or substance of its
investigations in defending charges of unfair denial of outside
employment. Thus, I find the Division's argument has greater
merit and deny the inclusion of paragraph D, which would have
subjected disputes under the article to arbitration.

I award the following language:

A. An employee serving in the title of Detective may

engage in outside employment with prior approval from the

Chief.

B. An employee serving in the title of Detective desiring

to engage in outside employment shall request permission in

writing from the Chief of Detectives. Approval or
disapproval of such requests shall be transmitted within
fourteen (14) calendar days thereafter.

C. It is understood that outside employment shall in no

way interfere with the efficient operation of the Division

of Criminal Justice and the absolute priority of the

Detective's responsibility to assignments in his/her work

as a Detective.

D. Any grievance under this Article shall be submitted

directly to the Chief of Detectives, but shall not be

subject to the grievance arbitration procedures

RETIREMENT CREDENTIALS

The Union proposes:

262
The Division of Criminal Justice shall provide
identification cards for retired Detectives, in
compliance with Federal Public Law 108-277, the “Law
Enforcement Officers’ Safety Act.”

The Union argues that it is merely requesting the Division
provide detectives with retirement credentials, namely
identification cards, when they retire from the Division. This
is a practice that is currently adhered to by the Division

The State did not make an argument about this proposal.

I take administrative notice of the “Law Enforcement Officers’

 

Safety Act,” P 111-272) (*LEOSA”),

 

108-277, (or,

 

referenced by FOP, codified at 18 U.S.C. 926C “Carrying of
concealed firearms by qualified retired law enforcement
officers.”

This provision exempts qualified retired law enforcement
officers from local and State laws against carrying concealed
firearms. In summary, the law provides that qualified retired
law enforcement officers who carry the proper identification may
carry concealed firearms across state lines, subject to the
limitations that private citizens can prohibit firearms on their
property and a State can restrict the concealed weapons on its
property, i.e. parks, schools, buildings, etc

The identification required by subsection (d) of 18 USC 926
is a photographic identification (“ID”) issued by the agency
from which the individual retired as a law enforcement officer

The ID indicates that the individual has, not less recently than

263
one year before the date the individual is carrying the firearm,
met qualification standards in firearms training

Alternately, the ID can be a photographic identification
issued by the agency from which the individual retired and a
certification issued by the State in which the individual
resides or by a certified firearms instructor that indicates the
retired officer, within one year before the date the individual
is carrying the firearm, has met the State standards for
qualification in firearms training.

In either case, the agency from which the officer retired
must provide the photo ID.

Here, the testimonial evidence appears to show that the DCJ
already provides them to retired detectives. The State did not
object to this provision. The State does not deny that the
Division already provides the benefit to retired detectives

I award this benefit since I find that, as a practice, the
Division already issues the IDs. The retirees could not obtain
the IDs anywhere other than from the Division and without the
IDs, it appears retired officers would not be able to avail
themselves of the rights afforded them by LEOSA.

I award the following

The Division of Criminal Justice shall provide

identification cards for retired Detectives, in

compliance with Federal Public Law 108-277, the “Law

Enforcement Officers’ Safety Act.”

PERSONNEL PRACTICES

264
The Union proposes the following language

B. The State agrees to make information concerning

employee health benefits and information on educational

programs, if available, accessible to all employees in
electronic format.

The State proposes the following language:

B. The State agrees to make information concerning

employee health benefits accessible to all employees in

electronic format.

Here, the only disagreement between the parties on this
clause involves the availability of information on educational
programs. The FOP contends that inclusion of this proposal is
reasonable and should be awarded. As described by Donlan,
including this information and making the same accessible to the
members would not only benefit the members themselves, but the
Division. (11-100). Specifically, apprising members of
educational program afforded to them would undoubtedly encourage
members to participate in such programs. In turn, this will
enhance the operational effectiveness of the Division

The State opposes this provision. Dee testified that the
State opposes the disputed portion of the Union’s proposal, not
because the State is opposed to its detectives having
educational opportunities, but rather because it is so poorly
drafted. The proposal is vague, has no limitations, is wide-
open to interpretation, and if awarded is sure to be the subject

of multiple disputes and grievances. (3T-115). As written, the

proposal could easily be read to apply to any and all

265
educational programs regardless of subject matter, by whom

offered, or to whom they might apply. The Union does not even

limit its proposal to educational programs relevant to the unit

members’ job duties. As Director Dee testified, the scope of

the educational programs covered by the proposal is limitless

(Bag

10/30/14, p. 115 (Dee)). For the foregoing reasons, the

State argues that its proposal should be awarded

I award the Union’s proposal with modifications to address

the State’s concerns.

A. To the extent information is available to the
Division, it will provide such information concerning
degree and certification programs offered through the
State colleges and to which DCJ detectives might be
eligible for tuition aid, to all employees in electronic
format.

B. The State agrees to make information concerning
employee health benefits accessible to all employees
in electronic format.

ACCESS TO PERSONNEL FILES

The Union proposes:

Cc. An employee may request the correction or
expungement of information in the file where there are
pertinent and substantive inaccuracies or for reasons
of time, duration, relevance or fairness. Such request
will be evaluated in relation to the State's needs for
comprehensive and complete records but shall not be
unreasonably denied when the inaccuracies can be
satisfactorily documented by the employee.

The State agrees to the Union's proposed language with the

exception of the phrase “. . . for reasons of time, duration,

relevance or fairness.”

266
The FOP argues that its proposal merely broadens the
categories of consideration in deciding whether certain
information in an employee's personnel file should be corrected
and/or expunged. It cannot reasonably be countenanced that
categories such as “time, duration, relevance, or fairness” are
not adequate criterion to consider when determining whether
information should be corrected and/or expunged from a personnel
file. An employee’s personnel file or “jacket” is the basis
upon which many employment decisions, such as promotions and/or
discipline, are based upon. As such, it is imperative that the
information included therein is not unfairly prejudicial to the
employees. Given the proposal seeks to ensure the integrity of
the employees’ personnel files, it should be awarded

The State argues that the Union’s proposed phrase “or for
reasons of time duration and fairness” should be rejected. As
Dee explained, there are multiple uses for information contained
in a personnel file and the State has an interest in maintaining
historical information. The State is willing to allow for
expungement (and arbitration for unreasonable denial) in so far
as the expungement concerns objective “substantive inaccuracies”
that can be documented. The Union’s criteria “reasons of time
duration and fairness” are subjective and may be used, for
example, to request the removal of a discipline that an employee
believes is no longer fair because of the passage of time. Such

a dynamic is inimical to the State’s interest in keeping

267
complete and accurate records. Finally, the phrase “Such
request will be evaluated in relation to the State's needs for
comprehensive and complete records” provides context for an
Arbitrator in the event a request to remove records is
challenged as being “unreasonably denied.”

In light of the above, the Arbitrator should award the
provision regarding expungement of personnel records as proposed
by the State.

I find that the integrity of the files is better maintained
when the information within them is complete and accurate, and
the Article addresses this purpose by permitting expungement of
inaccurate information. I find that the State’s interest in
retaining accurate and complete personnel records outweighs the
interest of employees in having older negative information
removed from their files. The age of information would
reasonably be taken into account in future personnel decisions.
Accordingly, I do not award the phrase “or for reasons of time
duration, relevance or fairness” in the first sentence of the
proposed language. The remainder of the paragraph is awarded as
follows:

Cc. An employee may request the correction or

expungement of information in the file where there are

pertinent and substantive inaccuracies. Such request

will be evaluated in relation to the State's needs for

comprehensive and complete records but shall not be

unreasonably denied when the inaccuracies can be

satisfactorily documented by the employee

PROBATIONARY EMPLOYEES:

268
The Union Proposes:

New employees hired by the Division of Criminal

Justice shall be considered on probalionary status Lor

a period of six (6) months. After six (6) months of

probationary status and depending on satisfactory

supervisory review, the employee shall be considered
permanent. Once an employee has reached permanent

status, his/her Seniority shall be retroactive to

his/her date of hire as a Detective.

The Union argues that this proposal is simple and
straightforward. In essence, the FOP wants to clearly delineate
who is considered a “probationary employee” and, if the
probationary status is satisfactorily completed, what their
seniority date would be. Given that FOP’s proposals complete
both these objectives, an award of the same is warranted

The State asserts that there is no basis or relevance to
the Union's proposal, and therefore, it should be rejected.
Donlan admitted and Miller confirmed that there are not now, nor
have there ever been probationary detectives employed in the
DCJ. For the foregoing reasons, the Union’s proposal must be
rejected.

Given that detectives in the Division are not subject to a
probationary period, I find that contract language on this issue
is not relevant and unnecessary. I decline to award this
provision,

SENIORITY:

The Union propose

 

269
A. Permanent Employees shall be considered to have
State seniority as of the date of hire with the
Division of Criminal Justice in the capacity of
conducting criminal and/or civil investigations in an
invesligalive title. Such State seniority shall
accumulate until there is a break in service from the
Division of Criminal Justice. State seniority of an
employee who is reinstated after a period of layoff
shall be continued retroactively exclusive of the
period of layoff.

B. A break in continuous service occurs when an
employee resigns, is discharged for cause, retires, is
laid off, or leaves the Division of Criminal Justice
for employment within another Department, Division,
Commission, Authority or any other subdivision of the
State of New Jersey or any other government agency
For purposes of this Article, a detachment to work
with another governmental agency, such as a task force
assignment, will not constitute a break in continuous
service.

C. Every six (6) months the State will provide to
the Negotiations Unit a current seniority list. Any
disagreement concerning the accuracy of the list will
be made known to the State within one (1) month of the
posting and corrective action will be initiated at
this level. If there is a continued disagreement with
the seniority list the same will be resolved pursuant
to the grievance procedure as stated under Article

of this contract.

Seniority, as described in the section, will be
applied to all sections of the Agreement that
reference seniority as a requirement.

The FOP acknowledges that detectives do not have the right

 

to bid for posts and/or pos. ons in the various Division’s
bureaus, as indicated by Donlan during direct examination.
Additionally, FOP also acknowledges that its members do not have

“bumping” rights in the event that there was a Department-wide

layoff.

270
Notwithstanding the foregoing, FOP asserts that
establishing a seniority list does have a purpose within the
Division. While, al the current Lime, requests for vacation
leave and administrative time of is not an issue, conflicts can
develop in the future, especially because the grant of these
requests typically hinge on an individual supervisor's
discretion. (1T-115-116). An award of a seniority provision
would solve such dilemmas quickly and easily as well as prevent
arbitrary decisions with regard to the same

The State argues that this proposal is unnecessary and will
only lead to confusion or potential litigation

I find this provision to be unnecessary. In fact, there is
no provision in the contract which pins a benefit to seniority
While the Union’s stated goal is that it wants a method of
resolving issues over vacation selection, its vacation proposal
did not address vacation selection by seniority. I decline to
award this proposal

INFORMATION AND SPECIAL PROVISIONS

 

The FOP proposes the following provision:

A. The Evaluation System shall be applied equally to
all Detectives.

Neither party submitted any argument concerning this provision
I find that the need for this proposal has not been justified
and is therefore not granted.

LABOR/MANAGEMENT COMMITTEE

271
The Union proposes:

A. A committee consisting of State representatives

Division of Criminal Justice personnel and Lodge

members shall be established fur Lhe purpose of

reviewing the administration of this Agreement and to

discuss problems which may arise.

B. Said committee may meet bi-monthly or whenever the

parties mutually deem it necessary. These meetings

are not intended to by-pass the grievance procedure or

to be considered contract negotiation meetings but are

intended as a means of fostering good employment

relations through communications between the parties

C. Either party may request a meeting and shall submit

a written agenda of topics to be discussed seven (7)

days prior to such meeting

D. A maximum of four (4) members of the Negotiations

Unit, the Negotiations Unit’s Executive Board and the

Negotiations Unit Attorney may attend such meetings

and, if on duty, shall be granted time off to attend

not to be deducted from the time provided in

Article

The Union contends that it seeks to establish a committee
that will consist of members of the administrative staff and the
Union. The committee will have the ability to come together to
discuss the administration of this first collective negotiations
agreement. The Union notes that both FOP and the State are
about to enter “uncharted waters” once the interest arbitration
award is rendered. It argues that it is merely sound
operational policy to create a committee that can come together
to discuss issues that may arise regarding the implementation of
the contract going forward

While the FOP acknowledges the creation of this committee

will take some time away from certain employees performing their

272
official duties, it contends that it will save considerable time
and money, going forward, by resolving certain issues without
resort to the grievance procedure. Once again, this proposal is
reasonable given the fact this is the first collective
negotiations agreement between the parties and is fiscally
responsible in the long run

The State responds that the stated intent of this proposal
is for the Union (represented by its entire executive board, up
to four additional unit representatives, and the Union’s
attorney) to have a vehicle to review with DCJ “personnel”
problems that may arise under the Agreement. The State agrees
that open and continued communication between the Union and the
appropriate State representatives are beneficial and even
necessary. However, the State does not agree that the
establishment of a formal committee as offered by the Union is
warranted and certainly not justified by the record evidence
which has not established any reluctance by management to
communicate with representatives of its employees. As such, the
State asserts that the Union has failed to satisfy its burden of
establishing a need for the creation of a committee by contract.

The State further argues, that the Union has also not
established (or even explained) the need to have an attorney
present as a member of the committee. Although other State
contracts contain language providing for committees somewhat

similar to that offered by the Union, none ot those contracts

273
provide for the inclusion of either party’s legal counsel as a
committee member. As Dee testified, “to include an attorney
really changes the dynamic of the whole committce,” and, in the
State’s view, would tend to hinder, rather than facilitate,
communication between the parties.

Additionally, the number of committee members on the
Union's side would likely result in a drain on the State's
limited resources.

The State further objects to Section D of the proposal
which provides for as many as twelve (12) Detectives being
relieved from duty to attend these committee meetings without
that time being deducted from the Union’s union leave allotment
The stated purpose of this committee is to address contract
administration and problems, clearly topics that would be
encompassed within any union leave provision awarded. For the
foregoing reasons, the Union’s proposal should not be awarded

A labor management committee can be a useful tool in
resolving issues in a collaborative fashion rather than
resorting to the formal grievance procedure and litigation
This is particularly true when the parties are entering into a
collective bargaining relationship for the first time. However
the Union’ proposal would permit too many of its representatives

to attend such a meeting, meaning that they are not performing

274
their regular duties and there are then “too many cooks in the
kitchen.”

Additionally, the parties must now learn to work together
at the local level to resolve problems. I agree with the State
that bringing the attorneys into the mix adds an unneeded and
possibly counter-productive level of formality. Accordingly, 1
award the following:

A. A committee consisting of the Employer’s
representatives and FOP Lodge 91's representatives
shall be established for the purpose of reviewing the
administration of this Agreement and discussing
problems which may arise.

B. Said committee may meet quarterly or whenever the
parties mutually deem it necessary. These meetings
are not intended to by-pass the grievance procedure or
to be considered contract negotiation meetings but are
intended as a means of fostering a good employment
relations through communications between the parties.

C. Either party may request a meeting and shall
submit a written agenda of topics to be discussed
seven (7) days prior to such meeting.
D. A maximum of three (3) members of FOP Lodge 91 may
attend such meetings and, if on duty, shall be granted
time off to attend not to be deducted from the Union
Leave time provided in Article

DUTY TO DEFEND AND INDEMNIFY

The Union proposes:

C. Liability Claims Indemnification

 

All employees covered by this Agreement shall be
entitled to defense and indemnification by the State
against liability claims or judgments arising out of
the performance of their official State duties as set
forth in the Laws of 1972, Chapters 45 and 48.

275

 
It is understood by the parties that the State's
obligation to defend and indemnify employees against
liability claims or judgments arising out of the
performance of their official State duties is governed
by the Tort Claims Acl, specifically 59:10A-1
through 59:10A-6. For informational purposes, it is
here stated that the above obligation has been
interpreted by the Attorney General of New Jersey to
include actions against State Detectives and Non-
Commissioned Officers alleging false arrest, except
that such obligation shall not extend to false arrest
actions where it is determined by the Attorney General
that:

 

A. The act or omission was not within the scope of
employment; or the act or omission was because of actual
fraud, willful misconduct or actual malice; or the defense
of the action or proceeding by the Attorney General would
create a conflict of interest between the State and the
employee. Additionally, the State's obligation to indemnify
shall not extend to any award for punitive damages
ultimately granted against the Detective or Non-
Commissioned Officer who is the defendant in the action. In
any of the above matters, the Attorney General may
determine and authorize the use of outside counsel where
in his judgment, such is warranted. In such cases the
reasonable costs of such counsel shall be borne by the
State.

The State proposes:
The State acknowledges its obligation to defend and
indemnify employees against liability claims or judgments
arising out of the performance of their official state
duties as governed by the TORT Claims Act, specifically
N.J.S.A. 59:10A-1 through 59:10A-6.

The FOP asserts that a contractual clause that obligates
the State, county, or municipality to defend and indemnify its
law enforcement employees against alleged acts of negligence
that may occur in the workplace is standard. (FOP-19). In

addition, Donlan testified the language proposed by FOP in this

article was taken directly from the Memorandum of Agreement

276
reached between the State Police and State in the year 2007.
(17-133) The Union asserts that the State agreed upon this
language in 2007 with a comparable law enforcement unit that
also falls under the jurisdiction of the Department of Law and
Public Safety and/or the State Attorney General, there is no
reason why this language should not be included in this
collective negotiations agreement.

The Duty to Defend and Indemnify provision is somewhat
similar in nature to Liability Claims Indemnification proposal
put forth by FOP. In that proposal, FOP wants to ensure its
members are entitled to defense and indemnification by the State
against liability claims or judgments arising out of the
performance of their official State duties. Again, a Liability
Claims Indemnification clause is found in each and every other
State law enforcement collective negotiations agreement. (FOP-
19) Moreover, the entitlement to defense and indemnification
for law enforcement officers is set forth in the Laws of 1972,
Chapters 45 and 48. Consequently, the FOP is merely seeking to
codify this legal entitlement and achieve comparability with
other State law enforcement units. As such, this proposal
should likewise be awarded

The State argues that its proposal and the first sentence
of the Union’s proposal say the same thing, that the Tort Claims

Act, N.J.S.A, 59:10A-1 through -6, obligates the State to defend

 

 

and indemnify employees against liability claims or judgments

277
arising out of the performance of their official State duties
It maintains that the Union’s proposal goes on to reference an
alleged past interpretation of the Tort Claims Act by an
unidentified Attorney General purporting to extend the State's
obligation under that Act to defend and indemnify Detectives for
some, but not all, false arrest claims

The Union presented no evidence of the context in which
that Memorandum of Understanding was entered into, nor did the
Union produce the referenced Attorney General “interpretation”
or to even identify the Attorney General who allegedly issued
it. In other words, the Union would have this Arbitrator award
language excised from an agreement that does not apply to these
detectives, without any understanding of what interpretation
that language purports to summarize or even any context in which
that language was drafted. Accordingly, no basis exists for the

Union’s proposal.

The defense and indemnification of State employees is
governed by the Tort Claims Act and nothing in this agreement
can or should even attempt to alter the meaning or provisions of
that law. Accordingly, at most, the State’s proposal which
recognizes that the Tort Claims Act governs claims for defense
and indemnification (and not the contract between these parties

must be awarded.

278
The Union also has what appears to be a duplicative
Proposal on the same topic under its “Effect of Law” Article
tilled “Liability Claims Indemnification.” That proposal
provides:

All employees covered by this Agreement shall be

entitled to defense and indemnification by the State

against liability claims or judgments arising out of
the performance of their official state duties as set

forth in the Laws of 1972, Chapters 45 and 48.

Since the employee’s right to defense and indemnification
is statutory, the contract need only recite the statutory
requirement. The Attorney General's opinion interpreting the
statute is unnecessary and subject to possible re-interpretation
at a later date. I award the following

Pursuant to Nv. + 59:10A-1 through 59:10A-6, the

Tort Claims Act, all employees covered by this

Agreement shall be entitled to defense and

indemnification by the State against liability claims

or judgments arising out of the performance of their
official State duties.

 

EFFECT OF LAW

The State proposes:

 

Savings Clause

If any provision of this Agreement shall conflict with any
federal or State law or have the effect of eliminating or
making the State ineligible for federal funding, that
specific provision of this Agreement shall be deemed
amended or nullified to conform to such law. The other
provisions of the Agreement shall not be affected thereby
and shall continue in full force and effect

The FOP proposes:

Savings:

279
In the event any provision of this Agreement shall
conflict with any Federal or State law, the
appropriate provision or provisions of this Agreement
shall be deemed amended or nullified to conform to
such law in which event such provision may be
renegotiated by the parties.

 

The difference between the two proposals centers on the
Phrase added by the State: “..or have the effect of eliminating
ox making the State ineligible for federal funding...”

The FOP argues that its language was taken directly from
the STFA contract as well as the collective negotiations
agreement the State entered into with the Deputy Attorney
Generals earlier this year. (FOP-24, FOP-19). The FOP contends
that it is merely proposing to utilize language the State agreed
to with two collective negotiations units that also fall under
the purview of the State Attorney General. Based upon the
foregoing, this contractual proposal should be awarded without
reservation as a matter of practicality

The State urges the Arbitrator to award the language which
includes the challenged phrase. There is no dispute that the
Division receives federal funds. The State is not aware of
anything in either party’s proposal that would jeopardize
federal funding. However, the language is intended to be a
preventative measure that will only be relevant if a particular
term or provision would make the State “ineligible for federal

funding.” The State is being prudent and reasonable for

280
proposing the language and the Union is being unreasonable for
resisting it.
I award the following:

In the event that any provision of this Agreement
shall conflict with any Federal or State law, or have
the effect of eliminating or making the State
ineligible for federal funding, the appropriate
provision or provisions of this Agreement shall be
deemed amended or nullified to conform to such law, in
which event such provision may be renegotiated by the
parties.

This ‘composite’ language will give the State its desired
protection should some provision cause a loss in federal
funding, and yet permit the parties to renegotiate the disputed
provision.

COMPLETE AGREEMENT
The FOP proposes the following language:

A, The State and the Negotiations Unit acknowledge
this to be their complete Agreement and that this
Agreement incorporates the entire understanding by the
parties on all negotiable issues whether or not
discussed. The parties hereby waive any right to
further negotiations except as specifically agreed
upon and except that proposed new rules, or
modifications of existing rules, affecting working
conditions, shall be presented to the Negotiations
Unit and negotiated upon the request of the
Negotiations Unit as may be required pursuant to the
laws of the State of New Jersey.

B. The State agrees that all mandatory negotiable
benefits, terms and conditions of employment relating
to the status of Detectives of the Division of
Criminal Justice covered by this Agreement shall be
maintained at standards existing at the time of the
agreement.

C. If, during the term of this Agreement,
legislation becomes effective which has the effect of

281
improving wages or fringe benefits otherwise available
to eligible employees in this unit, this Agreement
shall not be construed as a limitation on their
eligibility for such improvement:

 

The State proposes:

The State and the Bargaining unit acknowledge this to be

their complete Agreement and that this Agreement

incorporates the entire understanding by the parties on all
negotiable issues whether or not discussed. The parties
hereby waive any right to further negotiations except as
specifically agreed upon and except that proposed new
rules, or modifications of existing rules, affecting
working conditions, shall be negotiated upon the request of
one of the parties as may be required pursuant to the New

Jersey Employer-Employee Relations Act (Ch. 303 L. 68 and

Ch. 123 L. 74) and as amended.

The FOP maintains that its language is standard language copied
from other State law enforcement collective negotiations
agreements, to include the STFA. (FOP-24

Given that the proposal is routine and found in other State
law enforcement collective negotiation agreements, the same need
not be repeated at length herein. The FOP is seeking to include
the same language in its contract as every other State law
enforcement unit, this proposal should be awarded in its
entirety.

The State argues its proposal and paragraph “A” of the
Union’s proposal are similar but for one important distinction.
The State’s proposal provides both parties the mutual right to
request negotiation over proposed new rules and modification of

existing rules whereas the Union's proposal gives that right

exclusively to the Union. The State argues that its proposal

282
also properly ties the parties’ negotiations obligation to the
New Jersey Employee-Employer Relations Act, whereas the Union's
proposal ties the obligation broadly to the entirety of “the
laws of the State of New Jersey.”

Further, the State argues that the Union’s paragraph “B”
appears to be a maintenance of benefits clause but it is vague
ambiguous, and confusing. The clause refers to “standards
existing at the time of the agreement” which are “relating to
the status of detectives of the Division of Criminal Justice.”
Nowhere in its proposal does the Union define “status” or
“standards” as they are applied in this provision. Nor did the
Union proposal any testimony to explain its intent in making
this proposal.

The State asserts that the Union’s paragraph “C” is
likewise vague, amorphous, and ambiguous. The State recognizes
that certain benefits referenced in the parties’ proposals are
governed by Statute rather than the terms of the proposed
contract. Without identifying a particular statutory provision,
this vague proposal will do nothing but invite confusion and
disputes in the future. In essence, the Union wants the awarded
contract to have binding effect on the parties unless the unit
members would enjoy greater fringe benefits by virtue of
legislation. The State contends that, for the foregoing
reasons, the Arbitrator should award the State’s proposal and

reject the Union’s proposal, in its entirety.

283
I find that, as to paragraph A, it appears that the State’s
proposal is more generous to the Union in Lhal il would permit
the Union to “propose new rules or modification of existing
rules” as required by N.J.S.A. 34:13A. This appears to fly in
the face of the concept of the Complete Agreement language. It
is the employer who controls work rules which involve terms and
conditions of employment, and it is the employer who might seek
to change existing practices which would then trigger a
bargaining obligation with the union over those elements which
impact negotiable terms and condition of employment. The
State’s language just invites future disputes over the parties’
bargaining obligation

Concerning paragraph B, I believe the State correctly
perceives this as a maintenance of benefits clause. I award
this provision, which is contained in other State contracts with
law enforcement groups, with modification for clarity purposes

Paragraph C appears to guarantee the Union that any
statutory changes in employees terms and conditions of
employment will inure to the bargaining unit immediately
notwithstanding existing contract language to the contrary.
This is the flip side of the State’s proposed language
concerning statutory changes in benefits being effective

immediately. Modeling this provision after the parallel

284
language in that section, I award modified language. The

 

contract will contain the following provision:

A. The State and the FOP acknowledge this to be their
complete Agreement and that this Agreement
incorporates the entire understanding by the parties
on all negotiable issues whether or not discussed. The
parties hereby waive any right to further negotiations
except as specifically agreed upon and except that
proposed new rules, or modifications of existing
rules, affecting negotiable working conditions, shall
be presented to the Union and negotiated upon the
request of the Union as may be required pursuant to
the New Jersey Employer-Employee Relations Act,
N.J.S.A. 34:13A-5.3.

B. All existing, mandatorily negotiable benefits
and terms and conditions of employment of DCJ
detectives covered by this Agreement shall be
continued.

Cc. I£, during the term of this Agreement,
legislation is enacted which mandates immediate
changes in employee’s terms and condition of
employment, such changes will supersede any
conflicting provision of this contract. If
legislation is enacted which permit such changes to
become effective upon the expiration of any current
collective agreement, then the provisions of this
contract shall continue in effect

NEGOTIATION OF SUCCESSOR AGREEMENT

 

The Union proposes:

D. Collective negotiation meetings shall be held at
times and places mutually convenient to the parties.
The State agrees to grant the necessary duty time off
to Negotiations Unit officers and representatives not
to exceed six (6) in number, to attend scheduled
negotiation meetings. Said time off shall not be
considered “Leave” as defined under Article of
this contract.

The State proposes:

285
The State agrees to grant the necessary duty time off

to Lodge Officers and representatives not to exceed

three (3) in number, to attend scheduled negotiation

meetings. The State agrees that during working hours

without loss of pay, the designated Lodge Officers

shall be allowed to attend negotiation sessions and

shall not be required to charge leave time.

The dispute here primarily focuses on the number of
individuals that will be permitted to attend contract
negotiations sessions without loss of pay. FOP is proposing six
individuals and the State is proposing three individuals. The
FOP contends that this language is identical to other State law
enforcement collective negotiations agreements and is quite
telling as to why the request of six members is reasonable and
should be awarded.

In the contract between the State and the New Jersey Law
Enforcement Supervisors Association (State Correction
Sergeants), twelve employees are permitted to attend contract
negotiation sessions without loss of pay. (FOP-19) In the
contract between the State and the STFA, six employees are
permitted to attend contract negotiation sessions without loss
of pay. (FOP-24) In the contract between the State and the New
Jersey Superior Officers Law Enforcement Association (State
Correction Lieutenants), eight employees are permitted to attend
contract negotiation sessions without loss of pay. (FOP-19
Every State law enforcement unit has at least six individuals

able to attend negotiation sessions. The FOP is merely seeking

a comparable benefit.

286
The State urges that the Arbitrator award its proposal as
the Union's request for six paid representatives at negotiations
for approximately 136 employees is excessive. As Dee testified
there is a real cost in having people taken away from their jobs
in what could be a long process. (3T-148-49) Further, Dee
noted that in the recently concluded negotiations for a first
contract with the DAG unit, the parties agreed to provide for
three union representatives in a unit of 450. In terms of a
ratio, the State’s proposal here is more than reasonable

I have considered both party’s proposal on this issue. I
particularly note that the Union’s negotiating committee present
during all days of hearing in the interest arbitration consisted
of four detectives. I also note that the Division operates from
three locations. Therefore, it appears reasonable that the
Union be permitted to have four employee representatives present
during negotiations. I award the following:

Collective negotiation meetings shall be held at times

and places mutually convenient to the parties. The

State agrees to grant the necessary duty time off to

Lodge Officers and representatives not to exceed four

(4) in number, to attend scheduled negotiation

meetings. The State agrees that during working hours,

without loss of pay, the designated Lodge Officers

shall be allowed to attend negotiation sessions and

shall not be required to charge leave time, nor shall

Union Leave time be charged. The provisions of this
clause shall be retroactive to July 1, 2014.

standard operating procedures rules or regulations, or
existing policies, administrative decisions, letters
or memoranda of agreement, or laws applicable to the
agency or department which employs the grievant
affecting the terms and conditions of employment and
which are not included in A.1 above

Purpose

The purpose of this procedure is to assure prompt and
equitable solutions of problems arising from the
administration of this Agreement, or other conditions
of employment by providing the exclusive vehicle for
the settlement of employee grievances

1. Nothing in this Agreement shall be construed as
compelling the submission of a grievance to
arbitration. The Lodge’s decision to request the
movement of any grievance at any step or to terminate
the grievance at any step shall be final as to the
interests of the grievant and the Lodge

2. Where an individual grievant initiates a
Grievance, such Grievances shall only be filed by and
processed through the Lodge representation, unless the
Negotiations Unit provides specific permission to the
contrary.

Scope of Grievance Procedure

1. It is understood by the parties that this
grievance procedure represents the exclusive process

304
for the resolution of disputed matters arising out of
the grievances as defined above, except for those
specific matters listed below:

(a). Appeals of matters in dispute within the
jurisdiction of the Civil Service Commission shall be
made directly to the Civil Service Commission
subsequent to proper notification to the responsible
local management officials. Such matters include but
may not be limited to the following subjects:

i.  Out-of-title work
ii. Position classification and re-evaluation

an employee shall be processed in accordance with the
Discipline provisions of the contract

or orders of the State, shall not be construed as
bringing any allegation concerning the interpretation
or application of such matters within the scope of
arbitrability as set forth in this Agreement.

General Rules and Procedure

1. Where the subject of a grievance, or its emergent
nature, suggests it is appropriate, and where the
parties mutually agree, such grievance may be
initiated at or moved to any step of the procedure
without hearing at a lower step.

Where the Lodge requests a grievance be initiated at
Step Two or beyond based on a claim of emergency
wherein the normal processing of the grievance would
prejudice the effective relief sought or the
substantive rights of the grievant and, if such
request is denied by the agency of the State involved
the Lodge may seek an expedited determination by the
Office of Employee Relations of the appropriate step
to initiate such grievance

2. Where a grievance directly concerns and is shared
by more than one grievant, such group grievance may
properly be initiated at the first level of
supervision common to the several grievants, with the
mutual consent of the parties as to the appropriate

305
step. The presentation of such group grievance will
be by the appropriate Negotiations Unit
representative(s) and one of the affected grievants
designated by the Lodge. A group grievance may be
initiated only by the Lodge.

3. Any member of the collective negotiations unit
may orally present and discuss a complaint with
his/her immediate supervisor on an informal basis but
shall not expand the time limits for filing a formal
grievance unless mutually agreed in writing

4. In the event that the grievance has not been
satisfactorily resolved on an informal basis, then an
appeal may be made on the grievance form specified
below.

5. All formal grievances shall be presented in
writing to the designated representative of the party
against whom it is made on “Grievance Forms” to be
provided by the State. Such forms shall make adequate
provision for the representative of each of the
parties hereto to maintain a written record of all
action taken in handling and disposing of the
grievance at each step of the Grievance Procedure.

The form shall contain a general description of the
relevant facts from which the grievance derives and
references to the sections of the Agreement, which the
grievant claims to have been violated. The grievance
form must be completed in its entirety. A group
grievance initiated by the Lodge may be presented on
the above form, or where appropriate, in another
format provided that the grievance is fully set forth
in writing and contains all the information required
on the official Grievance Form.

6. When a grievance is initiated, the original
Grievance Forms shall be forwarded to the Personnel
Officer of the appropriate operating agency. After
the grievance is resolved copies shall be distributed
as designated on the Grievance Form

A copy of the decision of the State at each step
shall be provided to the Lodge representative
involved.

Grievance Time Limits and Management Response

1. A grievance must be filed initially within

306
fifteen (15) calendar days from the date on which the
act which is the subject of the grievance occurred or
fifteen (15) calendar days from the date on which the
grievant should reasonably have known of its
occurrence.

2. Where a grievance involves exclusively an alleged
error in calculation of salary payments, the grievance
may be timely filed within ninety (90) calendar days
of the time the individual should reasonably have
known of its occurrence.

3. Step One hearings shall be scheduled within ten
(10) calendar days of the initial receipt of the
grievance. The State’s decision shall be issued in
writing to the grievant and to the Lodge
representative within ten (10) days following
conclusion of the Step One hearing

4. The Lodge shall have ten (10) calendar days from
the date the Step One Decision is issued to appeal the
grievance to Step Two. A Step Two hearing shall be
scheduled within fifteen (15) calendar days from the
date of the appeal of the Step One decision. The
State’s decision shall be issued in writing to the
grievant and to the Lodge representative within
fourteen (14) calendar days following conclusion of
the Step Two hearing.

5. Should a grievance not be satisfactorily
resolved, or should the State not respond within the
prescribed time periods, either after initial receipt
of the grievance or after a hearing, the grievance may
be appealed within ten (10) calendar days to the next
step. The lack of response by the State within the
prescribed time periods, unless time limits have been
extended by mutual agreement, should be construed as a
negative response.

6. When a grievance decision is rendered the
decision shall contain a notice informing the Lodge of
the name and position of the next higher level of
management to whom the appeal should be presented.

7. Time limits under this Article may be extended in
writing by mutual agreement and requests for
extensions of time limits will not be unreasonably
denied.

307
8. If, at any step in the grievance procedure, the
State’s decision is not appealed within the
appropriate prescribed time, such grievance will be
considered closed and there shall be no further appeal
or review.

retroactivity beyond the date on which the grievance
was initiated or the fifteen (15) day period provided

matters shall be corrected to date of error within any
applicable statute of limitations

State representative or his/her designee shall hear
the grievance, witnesses may be heard and pertinent
records received. The grievant may be represented
by a Lodge officer or fellow Negotiations Unit
employee at the institution or office involved. The
circumstances surrounding a grievance may suggest
that the Lodge President or a member of the Lodge’s
Executive Board has a particular need to assist in
the presentation of the grievance at Step One. He
may make a request to do so to the Office of
Employee Relations. Such request shall not be
unreasonably denied.

Step Two

If the grievance is not satisfactorily disposed of
at Step One, it may be appealed to the Office of the
Attorney General which shall appoint a person to
hear the appeal who shall not be a person who was
directly involved in the grievance. The appeal

preceding level and any written record that has not
been made part of the preceding hearings

Unit President or his designee. The Lodge may
