This Award arises out of an impasse between the Policemen’s Benevolent
Association, Local 295 [the “PBA” or “Union"] and the Township of Little Egg
Harbor [the “Employer” or “Township"]. Their current collective negotiations
agreement expired on December 31, 2018, and they have been unable to reach
a new agreement through voluntary, direct negotiations. In accordance with
N.J.S.A. 34:13A-16(e)(1), and pursuant to an interest arbitration petition filed by
PBA Local 295, | was randomly selected by the New Jersey Public Employment
Relations Commission [‘PERC’] on January 14, 2020 to serve as interest

arbitrator.

I conducted two pre-interest arbitration mediation sessions with the parties
on February 7 and 26, 2020. Despite the efforts of the parties, they were unable
to reach a voluntary agreement during mediation. This required the development
of a formal record leading to an Award. Due to the declared State of Emergency
in March, the process could not go forward in the timely manner contemplated by
statute and caused the cancellation of hearing dates. After a temporary
cessation of the process, the parties agreed to a schedule enabling them to
submit their presentations through exhibits, financial reports and argument. The
documents include expert reports on the Township's finances from PBA financial
expert Raphael J. Caprio, Ph.D., and the Township's financial expert, Chief
Financial Officer Rodney R. Haines. In addition, a report on insurance issues

was provided by PBA health insurance expert Dominick Fanuele. This process
required time periods to be set beyond statutory direction in response to the
State of Emergency and received PERC approval. The Township and PBA each
filed post-hearing briefs which were transmitted to the parties simultaneously by

the arbitrator upon their receipt.

FINAL OR LAST OFFERS

As required by statute, each party submitted its last or final offer to each

other and the arbitrator. They are as follows:

PBA LOCAL 295

1. Term of contract
a. 5years. January 1, 2019 — December 31, 2023.
2. Salary

a. 3% per year across the board on each step of the
salary schedules with annual step movement.

b. Proposed new salary guides with the merger of the
two existing salary schedules into one.

3. Healthcare

a. Enroll in State Health Benefits Base Plan Direct 10/20
or 20/30.

b. Reduce Chapter 78 benefits to tier or year three in
2020 and to tier or year two in 2021.

c. Township to pay Medicare Part B for all retirees.

4. Incorporate Stipulations into the Award
THE TOWNSHIP

The Township offers to maintain the salary step system with step
movement for each contract year and add an additional percentage increase to
each step of the salary schedules in the amounts of 0% in 2019 and 1.5% in
2020, 2021, 2022 and, 2023. It proposes the same 5 year duration of contract as

proposed by the PBA. It rejects all other proposals.

BACKGROUND

This impasse arises in Little Egg Harbor Township, an Ocean County
municipality. It has a total area of 73 square miles, 25 of which is water. The
Township is unique in that it completely surrounds the municipality of Tuckerton.
It also borders several other Ocean County municipalities including Barnegat
Township, Lacey Township and Stafford Township, as well as Galloway
Township, an Atlantic County municipality. The Township has seen rapid growth
in its population and had slightly over 20,000 residents in 2010, 4,000 of whom
were new residents added to its population after 2000. That growth has

continued between 2010 and the present.

The Township is governed by an elected five member Township
Committee who annually appoints a Mayor from among its members. The Police
Department is active and dedicated to the use of Community Oriented Policing

which emphasizes the forming of partnerships with the Township's citizens. The
police bargaining unit consists of thirty-nine (39) Sergeants and Officers in total.
Within this total are nine (9) Sergeants and thirty (30) Officers. A layoff in and
around 2010 reduced the staff by ten (10) officers. The parties have negotiated
two (2) salary schedules for rank and file Officers. One is for those hired before
January 1, 2015 (Schedule A) and another for Officers hired after January 1,
2015 (Schedule B). Seventeen (17) Officers are on Schedule A and thirteen (13)
Officers are on Schedule B. The two schedules have the same values at the
Pre-Academy steps ($44,804) and the maximum step at twenty (20) years
($123,878). Schedule A has twelve (12) steps and Schedule B has fifteen (15)
steps in order to reach maximum step 20. The Sergeants also have two salary
schedules. However, the Sergeants’ schedules are not differentiated by date of
hire but rather by time in grade (1-3 years) for one schedule and more than three
(3) years in grade for the other. The PBA Agreement expired on December 31,

2018.

In addition to the PBA Agreement, the Township has collective
negotiations agreements with most of its other non-law enforcement employees.
One is with its Administrative Support Staff which includes Administrative
Assistants and Confidential Administrative Assistants and has terms from
January 1, 2017 through December 31, 2019. Another is with the United Service
Workers Union, IUJAT, Local 255 which includes Building (Sub Code
Officials/Inspectors), Plumbing (Sub Code Officials/ Inspectors), Fire Protection

(Sub Code Officials/Inspectors), Electrical (Sub Code Officials/Inspectors) and
Housing Inspectors and has terms from January 1, 2021 through December 31,
2021.1 The Township also maintains a collective negotiations agreement with
the Government Workers Union, an employee organization representing Public
Safety Telecommunications Operators. This agreement has effective dates from
January 1, 2016 through December 31, 2019. The record does not reflect that
the Township has reached any new agreements with any employee
organizations that extend beyond the expiration dates noted above. Each party
makes reference to these “internal settlements” in support of their respective

positions.

All Township employees represented in the above bargaining units,
including the PBA unit, receive medical and hospitalization coverage, prescription
drug coverage, dental coverage and vision coverage for full-time employees,
their spouses and the employee's eligible dependents. The current health
insurance plan is a private plan through carrier Horizon Direct Access 8. It is a
costly ($36,548 for family coverage) but comprehensive plan with attractive
benefit levels including, but not limited to, a $400 per person and $1,000 per
family out of pocket maximum with 100% reimbursement after the limit is
reached. All bargaining unit employees in all of the units are subject to health
care contribution levels at the highest Year 4 contribution levels pursuant to
Chapter 78, P.L. 2011. This statutorily mandated health care contribution
scheme required all Township employees by law, and without agreement through

1, 2017 and incorporated its terms into the January 1, 2021 Agreement.
negotiations, to make contributions based on the employee's salary and type of
coverage. The amount of individual contribution is linked to four tiers or years

phased in over a four year period that calculates the percentage of premiums

 

each employee must pay based on a sliding increased scale tied to an individual
employee's salary.2 For example, Tier or Year 4, the highest tier at 35% of
premium cost, requires eleven officers in the PBA unit who eam more than
$110,000 to pay $12,829.61 annually in contributions towards the cost of family
coverage. The lowest current contribution amount for a PBA member is for an
employee who ears between $55,000.00 and $59,999.99 and opts for single
coverage at 23% of premium cost with an annual cost of $3,319.29. Because the
PBA salary schedules generally contain higher salary levels than employees in
the other bargaining units, most of its members are at higher dollar levels which
cause greater contribution amounts due to employees having to pay higher
percentages toward premium costs based on individual salary. The PBA has
placed the issue of health insurance carrier selection and percentages of
contributions towards premium costs at issue. This latter issue is present due to
the fact that the statutory mandatory Chapter 78 requirements concerning
contribution levels, after the four year phase-in has been implemented, as here,
are subject to mandatory negotiations because after an Agreement that
experienced full implementation has expired. Chapter 78 allows for mandatory
negotiations over contribution levels under the circumstances present here when
pursuing a new agreement, so long as those phase-ins are complete and the

allow for waiver of coverage.
collective negotiations has expired. The parties’ positions on these issues are
described and analyzed below. The salary issue is also at impasse and will be
fully described and analyzed below. The health insurance and salary issues are
both economic in nature and one at the center of the record evidence and

argument.

DISCUSSION

As indicated, the disputed issues at impasse mainly concern salary and
health insurance. The salary issue concerns what shall the amount, if any, of
across the board increases be for each year of the stipulated contract duration of
five (5) years, January 1, 2019 through December 31, 2023. The health
insurance impasse centers on who the health insurance carrier and plan covering
unit employees should be going forward and what the previously statutorily
mandated, but now negotiable, level in the amounts of contributions employees

make towards health insurance premiums should be.

insurance issues described above when rendering an award on these proposals.
The submissions of both parties have been thoroughly reviewed, considered and
will be concisely summarized and analyzed below followed by an Award on the
disputed issues. In my evaluation of the proposals, | am required to apply the

show that extrinsic factors to be considered that are not stated in the statute must

valid in the absence of justification supported by credible evidence. | also note
that because economic issues normally implicate financial impact on the
governing body and the public or statutory spending and taxing limitations, they

must be considered not only individually but in their totality as well.

A question arose concerning whether the parties had entered stipulations
on certain issues pursuant to N.J.S.A. 34:13A-16(g)(4). That criterion allows for
the incorporation of the stipulated agreements to be incorporated into the Award.
The PBA prepared stipulations to be incorporated into the terms of the award
based on its view of the status of certain issues that it alleged resulted from prior

dialogue between the PBA and Township officials. They are as follows:

STIPULATIONS

Article V(a) — Holidays — All holidays, just as generally accepted
with Christmas and New Year's Day, should be recognized on their
actual date for purposes of overtime for employees bound by the
Rank and File Collective Bargaining Agreement (CBA), unless
specifically detailed as "observed" in the CBA.

Article V(b) — Holidays — Due to the nature of the patrol schedule

(12 hours shifts - 6AM to 6PM and 6PM to 6AM), it is the accepted
past and present practice of the LEH PD that a holiday begins at

1
6:00AM on the date of a holiday and continues until 5:59AM on the
following day for the purpose of an employee's entitlement to
overtime pay. K-9 officers are considered part of patrols for
purposes of holiday pay during their regularly scheduled work
hours. For employees not on said patrol schedule (SRO's,
Detectives, etc. ... ), the holiday begins at 12:00AM to 11:59PM for
purposes of holiday pay.

Article X(d) — Work Week, Overtime — In the event an officer
completing a tour of duty, is called out for K-9 duty, the officer
should receive a four hour call-out and it should not be considered
a continuation of their recently completed tour of duty.

Article _XV(a) — Insurance, Health, and Welfare - Newly
appointed officers will receive their health benefits immediately
and will not be subjected to the Township's 90-day waiting period.

 

Article VIl(b)(2) — Vacation — Class II Police Officers who are then
later hired in the capacity of a regular police will receive credit for
the years served continuously with the Township when calculating
vacation leave entitlement in subparagraph (A)(2) above.

Meal Allowance — The PBA is proposing that meal allowances are
adjusted from $12 to $50 and 50$ to $75.

Article XIV (D) - K-9- increase from 2 hours to 4 hours.

After discussion with the parties after close of record, it appears that the

above issues had been the subjects of various types of discussion that may or

may not have included grievance resolutions well prior to the arbitration. The

PBA submitted an exhibit summarizing its belief as to their resolutions.

Township does not share the PBA’s view that adjustments to grievances and/or
complaints had been made that can be considered stipulations. It became clear
to me that if any understandings occurred, and even if a debate over grievance
resolution might ensue in any future proceeding on contract interpretation, the

issues raised by the PBA in this proceeding do not rise to the level of formal

12
stipulation as required by N.J.S.A. 34:13A-16(g)(4). For this reason, and without
prejudice to either party's position on these issues, the proposed stipulations will
not be incorporated into the Award. The PBA’s ability to grieve over any of the
issues as a matter of contract interpretation or prior grievance resolution remains

unaffected by this decision.

I next proceed to summarize, evaluate and decide the issues at impasse.

ARTICLE XV — INSURANCE, HEALTH AND WELFARE

 

As indicated, Article XV identifies, among other things, the scope of
medical and hospitalization coverage, standards for change in health insurance
cartier, retiree health benefits and survivor health insurance benefits. Article XV
does not specifically identify the carrier. However, Article XV, Section A(2)
grants the Township the right to make a change provided that “there is no
reduction in the level of benefits that are in effect.” As previously noted, the PBA
seeks to change the health care insurance carrier and plan and, in addition, to
reduce the scheme for employee contributions currently set in the expired
agreement by the terms of Chapter 78 P.L. 2011. The Township opposes each

proposed change and seeks to maintain the status quo on each PBA proposal.

The PBA contends that its proposals on health insurance are both based
on providing savings to PBA members by reducing employee contributions

resulting from a switch to a less costly plan, reducing employee contributions by

13
lessening the percentage of employee contributions while simultaneously
reducing the Township's costs for providing medical and hospitalization
coverage. The PBA argues that the proposals would provide the Township with
greater financial flexibility to fund its salary proposal. The PBA relies upon the
reports of its health insurance expert Dominick Fanuele who presented detailed
information on the relative costs between the PBA's proposed NJSHBP Direct
10//20 and 20/30 Plans with the existing Horizon Direct Access 8 Plan as well as
the individual and collective employee savings that would be derived from lower
employee contributions caused by rolling back Year 4 levels to Tier or Year 3 in
2020 and to Year 2 in 2021. He also calculated Township savings that would
result from the switch in plans and a side by side comparison of the benefit levels
in each plan. On this latter point, the PBA does not contest the Township's
assertion that the existing plan, while more costly, has higher benefit levels.
However, the PBA contends that the price difference between the plans is
“exorbitant” and cannot be justified by the higher level of benefits in the existing

plan.

I have reviewed Mr. Fanuel’s analysis and charts. The PBA arguments
seeking support for its proposals follow the content of the reports. Drawing upon
the arguments presented in the PBA’s post-hearing brief, | set them forth in
pertinent part:

Specifically, if the Township were to switch from their current Direct

Access plan to the SHBP Direct 10 plan, the switch would result in
an annual savings of $67,172.84 to the Township. Additionally, if

14
the Township were to switch to the SHBP Direct 20/30 plan as the
PBA has offered to do, the Township would save over $131,979.00
annually in terms of health care contributions. The savings to the
PBA would be $46,925.80 and $74,385 respectively. The
township's refusal to consider cost savings of over $200,000 shows
that they are not concemed over the Township finances.
[Emphasis in original].

In the offer proposed by the Township, the Township failed to take
into account the savings the Township would net if they switched to
the more cost-effective State Health Benefits. The Township has
failed to provide a reason for not wanting to make this cost-saving
switch. In fact, the collective bargaining agreement between Lacey
Township and PBA Local 238 which the Township provided as a
comparable, illustrates a Township's willingness to negotiate health
care contributions for the benefit of both the PBA and Township. In
that CBA, the Township agreed to roll back to tier 3 contributions
under Chapter 78.

In this matter the Township has decided to remain silent without
even a discussion on health care. However, the Township did
concede that they would switch to a State Health Benefits Plan if
the switch was universally accepted throughout the Township. This
purported offer has yet to come to fruition. The Township's failure
to switch to a more cost-effective health plan must be taking into
consideration when reviewing the offers presented by both the PBA
and the Township.

Any final offers that were submitted by the Township and the PBA
were required to set forth exactly what they were looking for. The
final offer of the PBA seeks to enroll the PBA in Direct 20/30 of the
State Health Benefits Plan. Additionally, the PBA sought to reduce
Chapter 78 benefits to Year 3 in 2020 and Year 2 in 2021. Neither
the Township's response to the PBA’s petition nor in their final offer
to the arbitrator did the Township discuss the Township's current
health benefit plan. Currently LEH pays $36,648 for family
coverage for the Horizon Direct Access 8 plan. The SHBP Direct
20/30 rate is $28,224 for family coverage. The PBA is trying to
reduce costs approximately $8,400 or 23% a family. (See Exhibit
4).

Taking a look into the costs of the healthcare Direct Access 8 and
the SHBP Direct 20/30 shows that changing to Direct 20/30 and
cutting the Chapter 78 contributions in half would cost LEH less
money than they currently spend on healthcare.

15
Current Cost SHOP Cost

 

Current Annual Premium $ 862,116.72 $ 655,752.00
Less Ch. 78 Contributions $ 269,544.30 $ 195,159.11
Net cost toLEHT (net of Ch 78Contiib) _§ $92,572.42 $460,592.89

If the Arbitrator awards a change to the SHBP Direct 20/30 plan,
the township would pay $460,592.89 instead of $592,572.42 that
they currently pay.

Ifyou cut the Chapter 78 contributions in half (Tier Il) for the Direct
20/30 plan and add half of it to the LEH premium, LEH would spend
$558,172.44 for the Direct 20/30 plan. This would still save LEH
$34,339.97 per year. Over the remaining life of this contract (3.5
years) LEH would save $120,189.90. Ordering a change to the
base healthcare plan to the Direct 20/30 and reducing Chapter 78
contributions is beneficial to LEH, PBA, and the tax-payers of LEH.
The PBA should get the benefit form the plan switch and premium
reductions and a reduction in Chapter 78 based upon their
willingness to control the premium costs. LEH is more than satisfied
with paying almost $600,000 for the healthcare premium so the
majority of the plan savings should be returned to the PBA in
Chapter 78 reductions.

The PBA appears to acknowledge that prior interest arbitration awards
have denied proposals granting Chapter 78 ‘telief,” defined as reducing Chapter
78 contribution levels, but it seeks to distinguish the facts in this case from those
in others (Hopewell, Bedminster and West Windsor) where PBA proposals to

reduce Chapter 78 contributions were rejected. It submits:

In prior interest arbitrations, no party was in the position of seeking
a lower cost SHBP plan where the employer refused to make the
plan change. While arbitrators have been reluctant to reduce
Chapter 78 contributions, (See Hopewell, Bedminster, and West
Windsor) this case begs to set the precedent. No prior interest
arbitration had the union begging to join the SHBP and change to
the Direct 20/30 plan. LEH is refusing to accept over $200,000 in
yearly savings for the PBA and LEH.

Changing Chapter 78 contribution levels is spreading across the

state. Many departments have negotiated reductions in Chapter 78
contributions in exchange for healthcare plan changes. (See

16
Pleasantville Police, Hamilton Police (Atlantic County), Salem

Corrections, South Brunswick Police, Sayerville, Plainfield, Edison,

and North Brunswick. ... Health benefit changes that come with

substantial cost reductions weight in favor of the PBA on all

N.J.S.A. 34:13A-16(g) criteria. PBA 295 should not be forced to

pay for insurance that is not remotely cost effective. Therefore the

PBA seeks a reduction of Chapter 78 contributions to Tier III in

2020 and Tier II in 2021 as well as an ordered switch to the SHBP

Direct 20/30 plan.

The Township seeks to maintain the status quo and urges the rejection of
the PBA’s health insurance proposals to switch the health insurance carrier and
plan and to change the percentage contribution levels. It submits that reducing
contribution levels will cause future increases in its costs of providing medical
and hospitalization coverage and place undue financial burdens on the Township
thereby straining its budget. It notes that no other bargaining unit in Little Egg
Harbor has negotiated a reduction in Chapter 78 Year 4 levels. It asserts that the
private insurance plan it currently provides is a “significant upgrade’ over the
SHBP plan proposed by the PBA which it asserts, if implemented, would reduce
existing benefit levels its plan offers to Township employees. The Township also
emphasizes that the current terms of law would not allow it to implement any
SHBP plan only for employees in the PBA unit and any condition of
implementation, which is beyond its control, would require all other bargaining
units and contract employees to consent to the switch the PBA proposes. It

notes that no consent has been sought or received from any bargaining unit to

change the existing health insurance plan.

17
The Township's objection to the financial impact of decreasing employee
contributions to health insurance premiums is set forth in its post-hearing
argument, the theme of which it also applies to the salary issue. In pertinent part,

it states:

As referenced above, LEHT finds itself in a financial vise. As
referenced in Ex. A, the Township previously appeared to be
running at a surplus due to the Federal government staying
repayment of emergency aid loans received by LEHT for Hurricane
Sandy. This forbearance has since been lifted, the majority of the
loan will not be forgiven, and repayment will have to be completed
by 2023. Ex. A. This has essentially pushed the township into a
yearly deficit, and has necessitated, thus far, a 6.9 cent tax raise in
2019, with additional hikes being a matter of consideration. It's
worth noting that the 2019 Tax Rate was amongst the highest in the
counties, and the Township still required one-time grants and
revenue sources in order to make ends meet.

 

 

Additional contributing factors, as noted in Ex. A, include prior
mismanagement by former Administration employees, substantial
tax appeals, and decreased revenues and surpluses. Exhibit E
illustrates, in a digestible fashion, the current financial problems. In
particular, the final row, listed as “Net Ending Fund Balance,”
shows a small deficit for the year 2018, and a significant deficit in
excess of two million dollars for year 2019, which is approximately
ten percent of the Township's operating budget. These financial
shortfalls persist into 2020, and will likely persist until the FEMA
loan has been addressed.

 

Plainly stated and based upon the current financial posture, any
increase presents a hardship to the Citizens of Little Egg Harbor,
including the Township's Final Offer. Moreover, the state of the
larger economy has weakened the Township's income, specifically
the global Covid-19 pandemic and the associated recession. The
extravagant proposal submitted by the PBA would necessitate
drastic financial action in order to even approach compliance,
should the Arbitrator enter a decision favorable to the Union.

18
Award

| first address the PBA’s proposal to change the health insurance plan
from the Horizon District Access 8 Plan to either the NJSHBP Direct 10/20 Plan
or its 20/30 Plan. This proposal is intended to reduce premium costs thereby
providing savings to the Township and savings to unit members through reduced
contributions towards premiums. While the Fanuele Report clearly demonstrates
that savings would flow from making this change, this evidence, standing alone,
cannot support the awarding of this proposal. The proposal may conflict with
PERC precedent and health insurance statute. | do not rest its disposition here
on questions of law. Even assuming, for the sake of argument, that this issue
can lawtully proceed to arbitration, | do not find sufficient evidence to award the
proposal. Here, the Agreements with the other bargaining units are subject to
either the Horizon Direct Access 8 Plan or to a plan decided by the Township that
contains benefit levels that meet the high levels of contractual standards that
would allow for change. The record reflects that the benefit levels in the
NJSHBP 20/30 Plan would not meet the contractual standards to allow the
Township to unilaterally change the carrier and plan for its other units and would
require its other employee organizations to negotiate and agree upon the change
that the PBA seeks to be awarded in this proceeding. | do not find that the
interests and welfare of the public would be served by the Township having to
meet a burden to administer insurance plans that have differing carriers and
benefit levels. Accordingly, | do not award the PBA’s proposal to change the

health insurance carrier and plan. While doing so, | note that this does not

19
preclude the Township from voluntarily engaging in discussions, jointly or
separately, with the PBA and/or each of its other bargaining units to pursue

uniform changes to the health insurance plans and benefit levels.

I next turn to the PBA’s proposal to reduce Chapter 78 employee
contribution levels from the Tier or Year 4 levels to Tier or Year 3 levels in 2020
and to Tier or Year 2 levels in 2021. The Township urges rejection of this

proposal.

In order to provide proper context to the issue of Chapter 78 employee
contributions, | set forth below the statutory scheme that sets the contribution
rates that unit members are now subject to as the status quo. As noted, unit
employees are now subject to Year or Tier 4 levels. The charges provide the
linkage between salary and percentages of employee contribution toward
premium cost. As evident from the charts, each employee's salary range
dictates the percentage of premium cost each must pay depending on whether
the coverage and its cost is Single, Family or Member/Spouse/Partner or

The PBA’s proposal to reduce employee percentage rates and the actual
amount of contributions made must be viewed as an economic rather than a
philosophical issue. Contributions are required by law. They are currently
accounted for as revenue in the Township's budget. While negotiations for
revisions in levels of contributions are now mandated, on demand, Chapter 78
clearly states that the contribution levels in Year 4 of the phase-in constitute the
status quo for the purpose of negotiating change. Thus, any proposed change
for more or for less of a contribution would, if accepted or awarded, alter the
status quo when negotiating change. It is noted that even if the status quo is
maintained, contribution dollars are subject to annual change without negotiation
because, as provided by Chapter 78, required contributions for individual
employees are expressed in percentage of premium cost depending on the
range for an employee's salary. For example, an employee whose salary
requires at 35% contribution would be obligated for any increase or decrease in
premium cost increase by 35% while the employer's share of increase or

decrease would be by 65%.

22
The economic nature of the issue requires consideration of the financial
impact of the PBA’s proposal, evidence of internal and external comparability and
the interest and welfare of the public which, by its very nature, tends to implicate
and embrace all of the statutory criteria. The PBA’s proposals to move its
members from Year 4 levels to Year 3 levels in 2020 and then to Year 2 levels in
2021 would eventually halve the amount of employee contributions and increase
the Township's cost by assuming the other half that the employee no longer

pays.

The parties each acknowledge the factual impact of the changes in
Chapter 78 contribution rates. Currently, based on 2018 rates of pay, forty-four
(44) unit employees, twelve (12) of whom have waived coverage for which there
are no premium costs, the amount of employee contributions under Chapter 78
Year 4 is $269,544.30 annually and $22,462 on a monthly basis. The $269,544
in contributions is received towards the annual premiums of $862,116 and
monthly premiums of $71,843. Under the PBA proposal to move from Year 4 to
Year 3 contribution rates in 2020, the annual contributions collectively would be
reduced by approximately 25% to $201,750, an amount of approximately

$68,000.

The PBA proposal must be viewed not only as an individual issue but also

in the context of overall impact. | have done so. In respect to the statutory

criteria, the PBA has established that some weight must be given to comparisons

23
with employees performing the same or similar services in the jurisdictions of
Barnegat, Lacey and Stafford Township, all of whom have negotiated changes in
Chapter 78 contribution levels from Year 4 back to Year 3. | do not find these
comparisons to be dispositive but that they are entitled to weight given the salary
award that follows which in 2019 does not include an across the board increase.
| find support for a similar change proposed by the PBA to the Year 3 level but
with an implementation date of January 1, 2023 instead of the PBA's proposed
date of January 1, 2020. | do not award its proposal for a similar amount of
reduction that would reduce contributions from Year 3 to Year 2 rates in 2021 or

any date thereafter.

The amount of cost reduction to the employees results in an identical
increase in costs to the Township. Based on reported aggregate salary costs of
$4,028,455, the increased cost to the Township as a result of the reduction to
Year 3 contribution levels calculates to approximately 1.75% of base salaries.
Put another way, it impacts on the Township in the same manner as a salary
increase to employees but without incurring roll up costs such as overtime and
pension contributions, which base salary increases would require? | have also
considered this issue and this award in concert with the disposition of the salary
issue for 2019 which renders the award on contributions more reasonable due to
the lower cost impacts of an across the board increase in 2019 that also would
flow through the remainder of the Agreement. There are financial impacts

* The precise costs and percentage may fluctuate because these figures are based on 2018 rates
of pay but the fluctuations are minimal in nature and do not materially impact on this analysis.

24
stemming from reduced employee contributions, as well as salary and | find, for
the reasons set forth in the salary award that follows, that an award of the
Township's salary proposal in year 2019 to not provide an across the board
increase due to its unique financial posture in that year is a strong consideration
towards awarding the PBA’s proposal as a reasonable offset. Accordingly, |
award a reduction in Chapter 78 contribution rates from Year 4 to Year 3
effective January 1, 2023 and deny the PBA’s proposal for a further reduction to

Year 2 rates.

ARTICLE XIV — RATES OF PAY

As previously stated, the parties have negotiated two (2) salary schedules
for Officers. One is for those hired before January 1, 2015 (Schedule A) and
another is for Officers hired after January 1, 2015 (Schedule B). Seventeen (17)
Officers are on Schedule A and thirteen (13) are on Schedule B. The two
schedules have the same values at the Pre-Academy steps ($44,804) and the
maximum step at twenty (20) years ($123,878). Schedule A has twelve (12)
steps and Schedule B has fifteen (15) steps in order to reach maximum step 20
because certain steps require more than one year of service in order to advance
to the next step. The Sergeants also have two salary schedules. However, the
schedules are not differentiated by date of hire but rather by time in grade (1-3

years), or by having more than three (3) years in grade.

25
The existing rates of pay at the conclusion of the Agreement on December
31, 2018 are as follows. The parties’ proposed revisions and costs are to be

calculated off of these schedules:

The Township has proposed to maintain the 2018 salary schedule through
the first contract year of 2019 without an across the board increase but advances
eligible employees through their normal step movement. It calculates the cost of
step movement alone for 2019 at 2.87%. Then, for each contract year thereafter,
2020 through 2023, it proposes annual increases of 1.5% at each step of the
salary schedule while continuing to advance eligible employees annually through
normal step movement. Its proposed salary guides would reflect the following

revisions from the 2018 schedules:

The parties differences on the salary issue center mainly on their varying
views of the Township's budget and overall finances, their conflicting

perspectives on the reasonableness of their respective final offers, the evidence

30

 
offered on salary comparisons with specified municipal law enforcement labor

agreements and the weight to be given to internal settlements.

In respect to financial impact and the statutory appropriation and tax levy

limitations, the record mainly includes documentary evidence, financial reports

and argument. These have all been fully reviewed and considered. The breadth

of the data and opinions offered are broad in scope and cannot be set forth in

full. | initially will summarize the differences in the cost of the proposals. | note

that the costs of the estimated proposals as calculated by each party are not

identical but are generally consistent which allow for proper analysis without

regard to the rather minimal differences in the actual estimated costs.

The main contentions of the PBA in support of its salary proposals center
on the following points:

* The Department has been understaffed due to the Township's
failure to fill ten (10) positions following layoffs in 2010. This has
caused remaining officers to fulfil their responsibilities to the public
in a more productive, efficient and least costly fashion.

* The Township cannot make credible arguments alleging financial
constraint while simultaneously rejecting $200,000 in healthcare
savings that it would derive by a switch in its health care plan.

* The Township's salary offer is inconsistent with an alleged pattern
of internal settlements with its other bargaining units, none of which
received a 0% as the Township has proposed here and alll of which
received minimum 2% across the board increases.

* The PBA charts internal settlements which exceed the Township's
offer to the PBA:

* The annual increases in private sector wage changes in PERC’s
annual report show wage increases consistent with the PBA’s
proposal. The PBA's wage proposal is also consistent with
increases in New Jersey State government.

* While calculating its own proposal as a 5.4% average per year
inclusive of step movement, the PBA asserts its proposal is more in
line with interest arbitration awards on a year over year average
cost basis including step movement than the Township's. It cites
to:

33
financial report from CFO Haines includes evidence and argument in support of

— Ocean County Corrections 4.5%

— Evesham Township Fire District 4.25%
— Boonton PBA 6.67%

— West Windsor PBA 5.1%

The PBA cites the results of voluntary settlements in what it views
as comparable municipal law enforcement departments:

— Stafford Township PBA 2% + Steps 2017-2020
— Galloway Township PBA 1.95% + Steps 2014-2021

The PBA submits its comprehensive financial report supports the
ability of the Township to fund its proposal without adverse financial
impact and within the Township's statutory cap limitations.

Citing various revenue sources, tax collection rates and historical
regeneration of fund balances, the PBA contends that the evidence
reflects that the Township has a stable pattern of revenues that
overshadow short-term disruption, including those COVID related
and payback of FEMA loans thus showing that any revenue
shortfalls or loan payments are not structural in nature.

The PBA cites evidence that the Township has appropriated funds
well within its spending authority and below its statutory cap on
increases in its tax levy. It points to statistical data showing that the
Township's levies over the past three years to have been $1.1
million below its allowable statutory CPA.

The PBA submits that its cost analysis of the respective salary
proposals shows that an award of its proposal over the five years
would result in only an additional monthly tax and annual tax
increase of $0.63 and $7.52 on average.

The Township does not share the PBA's view as to its financial health. Its

its salary proposals. The main points raised in its submission include:

The $4.2 Million Community Disaster loan from the Federal Government
after Super Storm Sandy in 2012 were, by necessity, used in 2013
through 2015 as revenue to supplement the budget and have been the

Township's main source of surplus.

34
* The majority of the FEMA loan must be repaid and is expected to be paid
in full by 2023.

« Reduction in surplus has forced the Township to increase taxes by 6.9
cents in 2019.

* The Township cites the substantial impact law enforcement salaries have
on its budget which now calculates to almost one-third of its annual
operating budget not including pension and benefits received by current
employees and retirees.

* The Township also cites to municipalities it submits are comparable in
demographics, size and relative socioeconomic status as Little Egg
Harbor (Galloway Township and Lacey Township) who earn “significantly
less” than the salaries now received by the PBA.

As is normally the case in disputes over salary, there is rarely a single fact
or simple set of facts that are determinative of its disposition. The PBA does
assert the existence of a “pattern of settlement” in the Township's bargaining
units. If such pattern is alleged to exist, the arbitrator is compelled determine
whether it is so, and if so, to decide the weight to be given to the proven
settlement pattern with an explanation that there should either be adherence or
non-adherence to the pattern. The precedent on pattern is based on the
application of N.J.S.A. 34:13A-16(g)(2)(c). Here, while | find that evidence on
internal comparability to be relevant and entitled to significant weight, | do not
find the presence of a “pattem of settlement" that supports an award of the PBA’s
last offer or the imposition of a salary award for any specific year simply because

an existing agreement contains a salary figure that is above or below what the

PBA has offered.

35
The reasons for these conclusions are several. First, the Administrative
Support Staff, while receiving a 2% increase in 2019, agreed to this increase in a
contract beginning in 2017 and concluding in 2019. The PBA contract term will
be 2019 through 2023 and impasse was not declared until early 2020. Similarly,
the Government Workers Union negotiated a contract with a 2016-2019 duration
and received a 2% increase for 2019. These agreements were negotiated well
prior to the 2019 budget year where the record reflects a negative change in the
Township's budget. The Agreement that more clearly resembles the contract
duration for the PBA is that with the United Service Workers Union which runs
from 2017-2021. The agreement does call for 2% annual increases. However,
the agreement includes the incorporation of a prior 2017-2020 agreement where
salary increases were set prior to the 2019 budget and the incorporation of its
terms in addition to a one year 2021 increase. The expirations of these
agreements fall at a time well before the expiration of the PBA Agreement. Thus,
the span of years, as well as the timing of the increases, does not dictate that a
strict pattern of settlement exists. The budgetary implications for the PBA salary
disposition will be addressed in the analysis of the 5 year salary award below.
An additional factor that requires differentiation is the presence of the disputed
Chapter 78 employee contribution issue in the PBA negotiations which, as a cost
issue, must consider its financial impact on the Township's finances, as well as

the salary issue.

36
In the absence of a pattern of settlement that might potentially require
adherence, the disposition of the salary issue requires consideration of all of the
relevant evidence and the application of the statutory criteria. It is clear from the
manner in which the criteria has been constructed, that the greatest weight must
be given to the interest and welfare of the public criterion [N.J.S.A. 34:13A-
16(6)(1)] due to its many interrelationships it has with the remaining criteria. The
explanation for the predominant weight to be given to this criterion will follow the
wage increases to be awarded which | have concluded, on this record, to
represent a reasonable determination of the salary issue. The wages awarded
also have taken into consideration the overall financial impact of the Award,

including the treatment of the Chapter 78 employee contributions issue.

Based on all of the above, | have awarded step increases only for 2019, a
2% across the board increase plus step movement for 2020, a 2.25% across the
board increase plus step movement for 2021 and 2022 and a 2% across the

board increase plus step movement for 2023.

Although the PBA has established that the Township has had financial
flexibility within its statutory spending and taxing limitations [N.J.S.A. 34:13A-
16(g)(1) and (6)], | find the financial impact of an award beyond the 2.87% cost of
step movement in 2019 would have adverse financial impact on the governing
body, its residents and taxpayers due to the demonstrated constraints on that

budget year which not only impact that year but ensuing years by adding the flow

37
through costs of an increase sought by the PBA for that year of 3% or the cost of
its hypothetical cost analysis for a 2.25% increase. In particular, weight must be
given to sharp reductions in Excess Operation dollars in 2019, the sharply
reduced percentage of budget recovered in 2019, the sharply reduced fund
balance in 2019 and data showing a drop in the Township's ability to regenerate
funds to use as revenue as it did in the recent past. | do agree with the PBA’s
financial expert’s conclusion that the financial data for that year does not reflect a
structural problem and that a return to greater financial health will likely resume
thereafter. This will enable a resolution of the wage issue for years 2020 through
2023 at a level above the Township proposal of 1.5% but below the PBA’s 3.0%
proposal for the remaining years, as well as a partial, but favorable, consideration
to the PBA's proposal for a reduction in the percentages of employee contribution

towards health insurance premiums starting in 2023.

The terms of the Award have considered the remaining criteria as well.
The municipalities offered for comparison are valid for that purpose [N.J.S.A.
34:13A-16(g)(2)]. Such comparisons are relevant but not dispositive of a single
result. This is due to the different levels of compensation and benefits received
in those jurisdictions which defy precise side by side comparison. By way of
example, | note that in Lacey Township, holiday pay (of 128 hours) has been
rolled into base pay, that in Stafford Township longevity pay has been eliminated
for employees hired after January 1, 2014, as well as in Barnegat Township for

employees hired after January 1, 2018. | also note that in Little Egg Harbor,

38
longevity pay has been rolled into the salary schedule which tends to reflect more

favorable salary schedule than those municipalities that have not.

After consideration of all relevant evidence, | find that a reasonable
determination of the wage issue is an award of 0%, 2.0%, 2.25%, 2.25% and
2.0% across the board, plus the cost of annual step movement. This, when
coupled with the 1.75% cost impact to the Township resulting from the awarding
of reductions in the percentages employee now pay towards health insurance
premiums in 2023, provides reasonable consistency with the changes made in
comparable law enforcement units while also addressing financial evidence

unique to Little Egg Harbor Township.

The remaining criteria are also relevant, have been considered and | find
them to be in harmony with the terms of this Award. The salary terms relating to
the across the board increases are generally consistent with the cost of living
data [CPI]. While the award is in excess of the CPI when factoring in annual step
movement, | find the amount of across the board increases must be given
greater weight because they represent a fixing of salary structure for the future
for employees irrespective of changing seniority levels in contrast with individual
salary changes that fluctuate based upon an employee's length of service which
always undergoes annual change but without impact on the long-term salary

structure.

39
| have also considered overall compensation and benefits received by unit
employees [N.J.S.A. 34:13A-16(g)(3)]. This does not stand alone and requires
consideration of current levels compared with similar units in comparable
municipalities. There is nothing in this record that would dictate a result that
would significantly depart from this award based on the overall compensation
criterion. The Township's police officers are well compensated, receive more
than fair benefit levels without being hindered by any significant “inequity” that
would require a qualitative change to cure. Simply put, this Award will maintain
relative balance in the wages and terms of employment between this unit and
neighboring units without setting terms in this unit simply because they may exist
elsewhere. On a year by year basis, without cost of yearly compounding, the
wage costs are identical to the Township's estimate of $4,150,218 in 2019, with
an additional cost of 0.5% in 2020, an additional cost of 0.75% in 2021 and 2022
and an additional cost of 0.5% in year 2023. Based on review of financial expert
evidence, the additional costs are projected to fall within the Township's
spending and taxing limitations and cause reasonable financial impact that can
be borne within its overall financial obligations to the Township, its residents and

taxpayers

Finally, | note the PBA has proposed a merging of the salary schedules in
Schedule A and Schedule B. Although | find it reasonable for the parties to do
so, | do not award this proposal and instead defer to the parties’ apparent

willingness to construct a single schedule voluntarily and in a structure found to

40
be mutually agreeable. In the absence of such agreement, | award a

continuation of Schedules A and B for the remainder of this Agreement.

Based upon all of the above, | respectfully enter the terms of this Award.
