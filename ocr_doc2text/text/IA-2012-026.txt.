INTEREST ARBITRATION ANARD
On March 5, 2012 the Borough of Roselle Park Policemen’s
Benevolent Association Local 27 and the Police Supervisors Group
of PBA Local 27 each filed a Petition with the Public

Employment Relations Commission to initiate interest
arbitration over successor collective negotiations agreements
with the Borough of Roselle Park. The previous agreements
expired on December 31, 2010.

On March 19, 2012, I was appointed to serve as interest
arbitrator by a random selection procedure pursuant to N.J.S.A.
34:13A-16(e) (1). This statutory provision requires that an
award be issued within 45 days of my appointment with no
provision for a mutually agreed upon extension of any length.

By letter of March 19, I scheduled an interest arbitration
hearing for April 11, 2012 and directed each party to submit a
final offer no later than April 3 in accordance with N.J.S.A.
34:13A-16(£) (1).

The Borough of Roselle Park and the PBA/SOA each submitted
substantial documentary evidence. Both parties submitted Final
Offers and calculations of the financia] impact of their
respective economic proposals. The PBA and SOA submitted a
certilLication of Accountant and Financial Analyst Joseph
Petrucelli. The Borough submitted a certification of
Borough’s Chief Financial Officer Kenneth Blum. Post-hearing

summations were filed by April 20, 2012.

 

The PBA submitted the following final offer:

SUBMISSIONS OF THE PARTIES
The parties submitted well over 200 documents for my
consideration. While not all documents are discussed in this

award, all have been reviewed and considered.

Demographics

Roselle Park was incorporated as a Rorough by an Act of the
New Jersey Legislature on March 22, 1901, from portions of Union
Township. The separation occurred due to a number of grievances

based on a lack of sufficient public services, including; lack
10

of a modern sewage system, poor schools, neglected roads and
minimal public safety measures (RP-1).

Roselle Park is a Borough in Union County, New Jersey. As
of the United States 2010 Census, the Borough population was
13,297 with a density of 11,000 square miles (PBA-B6; RP-1).
The Borough has a total area of 1.22 square miles, all of it
land. The Borough is bordered to the northeast by Union
Township, to the northwest by Kenilworth, to the east by
Elizabeth, to the south by Roselle and to the west by Cranford
(RP-1).

The 2010 United States Census reported that there were
5,002 households and 3,407 families residing in the Borough
(PBA~B6; RP-1). As of the 2000 Census, there were 5,137
households out of which 30.1% had children under the age of 18
living with them, 50.8% were married couples living together,
11.2% had a female housekeeper with no husband present and 33.5%
were non-families. One-person households made up 28.2% of the
population and 8.5% of the population had someone living alone
who was 65 years of age or older. The average household size
was 2.58 and the average family size was 3.22 (PBA-B8; RP-1).

The 2000 median income for a household in the Borough was
$53,717 and the median income for a family was $63,403. The per
capita income for the Borough was $24,101. About 3.4% of

families and 4.3% of the population were below the poverty line,
il

including 6.3% of those under age 18 and 1.6% of those 65 or
older (PBA-B8; RP-1).

The Borough’s total real property valuation in 2008 was
$290,032,500 and $25,555,900 for commercial. The residential
real property valuation was $234,621,600 and the average
property value was $70,797 with a property tax of $7,745 (PBA-
BB).

The 2000 Census reported a total civilian labor force in
2007 of 7,488 with a 4.4% unemployment rate (PBA-B8).

Roselle Park Public School District consisted of five
schools, grades K-12 with an enrollment of 2,013 for school year
2007-2008 (PBA-B8).

The Borough of Roselle Park is governed by an elected Mayor
and six councilpersons. Roselle Park is divided into five
election districts, referred to as wards, with one councilperson
elected from each ward and one councilperson elected at large
(PBA-B1;RP-1).

Police Activity

Roselle Park had a total of 126 crimes in 2010 compared to
136 crimes in 2009 (RP-73). Of the 126 crimes, 17 were violent.
The Borough ranked 6™ lowest out of 21 Union County
Municipalities in overall crimes for 2010 (RP-73). The crime
rate per 1,000 residents in Union County averaged 18.4 while the

same measure of crime in Roselle Park was 9.5. During the
12

period Roselle Park experienced no murders, no rapes, 8
robberies and 9 violent assaults. Thus it can be seen that the
crime rate in Roselle Park is lower by every measure as compared
with the averages in Union County.

Budgeting

The Borough states that Roselle Park is currently
struggling financially due to the reduction and stagnation in
State Aid, overall decline in surplus, increase in pension
costs, health benefits costs and debt service (RP-129). The
lack of State Aid prevents the Borough from increasing its
surplus and requires it to seek other savings rather than to
continually raise taxes (RP-129).

The municipal surplus budget has reduced by $564,841 from
December 31, 2004 to December 31, 2011 (RP-129). The Borough is
trying to stabilize its finances since the loss in surplus. To
date, the Borough has not been able to generate the loss in
surplus in over seven years (RP-129}. The inability to
continually replenish the surplus affects the Borough’s fiscal
strength and ability (RP-129).

The chart below depicts the downward trend, through most

years, in loss surplus:

The Borough contends that in the past five years, the
assessed valuation has decreased by $4,307,975 (RP-129).
Moreover, the Borough is currently facing 17 State tax court
appeals and 109 County tax court appeals (RP-129). The Borough
previously had not been faced with increases in appeals as they
are now (RP-129).

In recent years, the troubled real estate market has
resulted in a substantial increase in the number of tax appeal
filings. In January of 2012, the New Jersey Department of
Community Affairs prepared guidance in the form of a Local
Finance Notice (LEN) 2012-4 for municipalities in preparing for
tax appeals and paying for their impact (PBA-M20). The guidance
states that prudent municipalities have been preparing for this
situation by conducting revaluations or reassessments to bring
property tax assessments more in line with actual market
conditions. The notice further goes on to say that these
municipalities have also appropriated adequate reserves to

prepare for the impact of pending tax appeals. However, even
4

those municipalities taking preparatory measures can still face
tax appeal judgments that exceed their reserves (PBA-M, M20).
The PBA maintains that LFN 2012-4 offers additional relief
to municipalities in the form of paying for the impact of tax
appeals (PBA-M, M20) such as, emergency appropriation to
authorize payment; issue notes in the amount of credits
reflecting overpayment in previous quarters for the current
year; and new legislation allows municipalities to borrow for
prior year cash deficits resulting from tax appeals (PBA-M,

M20).

The PBA and SOA assert that the December 31, 2011 Unaudited
Annual Financial Statement indicates that the borough has set up
a reserve account for tax appeals in the amount of $49,613 (PBA-
M, M20). They further state that the Borough has low net debt
and therefore has the ability to finance future tax appeals
instead of funding them with current operations revenues. They
say it is clear that pending tax appeals would not prevent the
Borough from funding PBA Local 27 and SOA Unit Member’s current

and future salaries and wages (PBA~-M).

Due to the increase in pensions and health benefits, debt
service and the decline in surplus, the Borough contends that it
has been forced to increase taxes to its taxpayers (RP-129). In
the past four years, the municipal portion of property taxes has
increased (RP-129). Specifically, there was a change from
$8,498,140 in 2006 to $11,038,188 in 2011, an increase of
$2,540,048 in five years (RP-129).

The chart below depicts the tax percentage increases:

es ose aE
Exhibit RP-120,129 | Percentage Increase

 
16

According to the Borough, one of the many reasons for the
tax increases, surplus decline and decline of fiscal strength is
due to the increase in police and fire pension costs (RP-129).
As a result, between 2007 and 2013, the costs for police and
fire pensions increased by $384,345! (RP-129). In addition, the
PERS pension contribution has been increasing since 2007 (RP-
129). Both pension contribution increases/decreases are shown

in the chart below (Exhibit RP-116,119,129):

Another reason for the decline in the Borough’s fiscal
strength is with regard to the increase in health benefit costs
(RP-129). Specifically, between 2009 and 2011, the costs for
active police officers’ and superior officers’ health benefits
have increased by over $157,937. In 2009, the costs of health

beneLits for retired PBA members and SOA members was $91,204; in

———_—_—_——————

‘pBA reflects a net increase of $304,356 whereas it should be $384,345.

2010 it was $110,729; in 2011 it was $151,973 and in 2012 it was
$195,557 for retired members (RP-129).

The chart below depicts the New Jersey (NJ) Direct 10
monthly premium for the PBA and SOA members estimated on 2012
base salaries. The PBA states that this will provide the
Borough with significant increased savings to offset future

health care costs (PBA-M)?.

?The results of the PBA’s calculation may be skewed since they averaged the
four types of coverage and the associated cost to acquire an average monthly
cost versus calculating the # of current employees in each type of coverage
to determine monthly costs by premium type, by calendar year.

New Jersey State Health Benefits Plan will be discussed below.
The State Aid for the Borough of Roselle Park has been
dramatically decreasing throughout the years. For instance, the
State Aid for the past seven years (2006-2012) has dropped by
34.70% or from $1,572,816 to $1,084,086 in 2012 (PBA-F1, M3.)
Morcover, the interest income has dropped by nearly $192,211

since 2006 to 2012 (RP-118, 129).

The Consolidated Municipal Property Tax Relief Act

(COMPTRA) is comprised of municipal property tax relief
programs. The State has continually reduced State Aid which was
funded by the Energy Receipt Tax.

Not only is the Borough of Roselle Park facing decreases in
revenues, State Aid and surplus, but the borough is facing an
increase of $649,975 in debt service since 2008 (RP-129).

The chart below reflects the percentage of tax collection

receipts for the Borough from 2006 to 2011 and shows a decrease

of 0.88% not paid in 2011 (RP-121,129;PBA-M):

The Borough contends that the salaries and wages of the
police department PBA and SOA members exceed any department in
the Borough of Roselle Park. Moreover, the average base salary
for the police officer is $78,060 in 2009 and $80,593 in 2010
(RP-129).

Overtime Costs

in the pasts three years the Borough has been able to

contain overtime costs (RP-129). The following chart (RP-33)

shows overtime costs for 2009-2012:
21

The PBA contends that since January 1, 2011, seven (7)
members of the Police Force have separated from the force,
either through retirement or resignation (PBA-M). The estimated
savings produced through the breakage over the proposed contract
period ending December 31, 2013 is $1,306,938.44. It contends
that this breakage will provide the Borough with savings that
can help fund the requested salary and wage proposals for PBA
Local No.27 and the SOA (PBA-M). The PBA also provided
information on two new members hired since the expiration date
of the contract. It has included the projected cost of the new
hires in their cost proposal analysis (PBA-M).

The PBA states that the Borough has continually spent less
than budgeted (PBA-M). The unexpended appropriation and
encumbrance reserves indicated in the chart below allow the
Borough to apply these unexpended appropriation reserves to
future budget periods. Any encumbrance cancelled and
appropriation reserves that lapse after one year generate
sucplus (PBA-M). It goes on to further illustrate that
unexpended balances of appropriation reserves lapse to budget
operations in the second budget year after the budget year in
which they are generated. Cancelled encumbrances lapse to
surplus in the budget year cancelled. The 2011 Audited Annual
Financial Statement indicates that $403,659 of prior year

appropriation/encumbrance reserves had lapsed into budget
22

operations for the 2011 budget year. 2011 unexpended
appropriation reserve balances of $395,406 will lapse to budget
operations in the 2013 budget year. 2010 unexpended
4ppropriation reserve balances of $469,295 will lapse to budget
operations in the 2012 budget year (PBA-M).

The chart below reflects the prior years’ appropriation
reserve balances that have lapsed to Surplus (PBA-M, M9). An
analysis of the lapsed balances for the period 2005 through 2011
indicates that, on average 58.45% of the appropriation reserve
balance has lapsed to surplus. Utilizing that historical

average the PBA states that the Borough could recognize $274,285

($780,835 X 58.45%) of surplus in 2012 (PBA-M, M9).

The Borough has conditionally had additional revenues it
did not anticipate and per the Unaudited Annual Financial
Statement as of December 31, 2011, the Borough had additional
revenue of $169,512 (PBA-M10). This indicates that the Borough
has consistently received additional revenue from sources not
anticipated in the budget or raised by taxation. According to
the PBA, this revenue is available for budget appropriations in
future years.

The chart below indicates that the Borough could have
anticipated an additional $403,367 in municipal revenues from
local sources in the 2012 proposed budget based on the actual
collections from the 2011 budget cycle (PBA-M). The PBA states
that it is common governmental practice to utilize the amount
realized in the prior year. They state that this is additional
revenue that is not limited by the 2% cap and may be available
to hold down taxes and fund the PBA Local No. 27 and SOA Unit

Members’ proposals (PBA-M11).

The PBA maintains that the Borough has significant
remaining borrowing ability due to its low outstanding net debt
(PBA-M, M13). The amount of statutory debt limit utilized as of
December 31, 2011 was 36.91% or $15,861,402 leaving remaining
borrowing power of the Borough at $27,112,526 (PBA-M, M13).

The PBA performed a fiscal analysis of the Borough’s budget
and has highlighted the following additional items as evidence
to support their conclusion that the Borough of Roselle Park has

the financial ability to pay for the PBA Local 27 and the SOA‘’s

Appropriations Cap

Chapter 68, Public Laws of 1976, as amended, place limits
on certain municipal expenditures. The limit for 2011 is 2%;
however the Borough of Roselle Park adopted an index rate
ordinance increasing their allowable spending limitation to 3.5%
(RP-11). This limit, generally referred to as a “CAP”, is
calculated by methods established by law. The following
schedule shows the computation of the maximum amount of increase
allowable in the Budget for 2012 over that of the 2011 Adopted

Budget for the Appropriations subject to the “CAP Law” (RP-11).

2% Tax Levy Cap

For 2012, the Borough of Roselle Park identified its Prior
Year and Net Year Amount to be Raised by Taxation for Municipal
Purposes as $10,628,926 (RP-116). After applying the 2% Cap
Increase of $212,579, its Adjusted Tax Levy Prior to Exclusions
was $10,841,505 (RP-116). No Assumption of Service/Function was
reported. Additional Exclusions were identified as $5,800 for
an Allowable Health Insurance Cost Increase; $6,638 for
Allowable Pension Obligations Increase; $25,690 for Allowable
Debt Service, Capital Leases and Debt Service Share of Cost
Increases; $1,500 for Recycling Tax Appropriation; for an
overall Exclusion Total of $39,628. The Adjusted Tax Levy after
Exclusions was $10,881,133. A New Ratables Adjustment to Levy
in the amount of $8,716 and the CY2011 Cap Bank Utilized in
CY2012 of $495,578 were added to the Adjusted Tax Levy after

Exclusions for a Maximum Allowable Amount to be Raised by

Taxation of $11,385,428 (RP-116). The Amount to be Raised by

Taxation for Municipal Purposes is $10,903,447 (PBA-4; RP-116).

Cost of Living

The Consumer Price Index (CPI) is a measure of the average
change over time in the prices paid by urban consumers for a

market basket of consumer goods and services (PBA-Cl).
According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics February 2012
report, the Consumer Price Index (CPI) for All Urban Consumers
(CPI-U) increased 0.4% in February 2012 on a seasonally adjusted
basis. Over the last 12 months, the all items index increased
2.9% before seasonal adjustment (PBA-C2). The All Urban Group
represents about 87% of the total U.S. population (PBA-Cl). It
is based on the expenditures of almost all residents of urban or
metropolitan areas, including professionals, the self-employed,
and the poor, the unemployed and retired people, as well as
urban wage earners and clerical workers (PBA-Cl).

The Consumer Price Index for Urban Wage Earners and
Clerical Workers (CPI-W) increased 3.1% over the past 12 months.
For the month of February 2012, the index increased 0.5% prior
to seasonal adjustment (PBA-C2).

Organization of the Police Department: (Ex. PBA E-1)

The Borough’s police department consists of 34 sworn
officers. The Department is headed by Chief of Police Paul
Morrison, who has been the chief since 2007.

The police department consists of a traffic bureau, a
detective bureau, a community policing unit which includes a
bicycle squad, and the D.A.R.E. Program. The Traffic Bureau is
supervised by Patrolman Antonucci. He is responsible for school
crossing guards, the school safety program, the investigation of

serious traffic accidents, and handicapped parking permits.
The Community Policing Unit includes officers equipped with
mountain bikes, which enables them to patrol the Borough’s parks
and playgrounds and better interact with citizens.

The detective bureau, at least as of 2011, consists of a
sergeant, detectives and a juvenile detective. It is
responsible for investigating crimes, preparing cases for the
grand jury and juvenile courts, and attempting resolution of
juvenile cases. It also processes gun application permits.

The D.A.R.E. program is run in collaboration with the
schools, parents, community and government agencies to provide a
drug resistance and violence prevention program. The program
begins with 5% grade students and is a 10-week program. It
teaches kids responsible decision-making skills, provides ways
to resist peer pressure, and consequences of behavior.

In the beginning of 2011, there were 2 lieutenants, 6
sergeants and 26 patrolmen. However, during 2011, 1 lieutenant
retired, 1 sergeant retired, and 1 patrolman was promoted to
sergeant. In addition, 1 patrolman separated from service, and
2 new patrolmen were hired. Thus, by the end of 2011, there was
1 lieutenant, 6 sergeants and 26 patrolmen. In addition, 3

patrolmen have or will leave the department in 2012. (Ex RP 19-
The expired contract does not specify what the existing
work schedule actually is. The PBA notes that most employees
are on a 4/3 schedule or a 3/4 schedule. It is apparent from
the Borough’s proposal that some employees are on a 10-hour or
12-hour shift.

Salaries:

The PBA contract for 2008-2010 includes a five-step salary
guide for officers hired before December 1, 2003, and a
separate, six-step guide for officers hired after that date.
Both guides have a maximum step of $83,366. As all of employees
on the “grandfathered” guide have now reached maximum, I

replicate only the newer salary guide, as follows:

| 2010
Academ $39,157
Probation | $48,119 |
$53,989

$65,728

$71,597
| $77,466
| $83, 336

a
$59,859
e

 

Newly hired officers are in the “academy” step for the first six
months. They then move to the “probation” step until they reach
their one-year anniversary, and move to Patrol Level I
(hereinafter referred to as simply “step 1”). Thereafter, on

their anniversary, they move to the next step. The dollar value
31

of these step increments, after movement from the academy to
probation step, is $ 5,870.

Pursuant to Article 8 of the expired PBA contract,
employees move on the step guide on their anniversary date. As
of the end of 2010, there were 9 patrolmen still moving through
the step guide and 16 patrolmen at the maximum step. The
parties stipulated that the Borough has paid officers their
increments for 2011 and is paying increments in 2012 as they
become due.

Superior officers in the SOA unit include only sergeants
and lieutenants. There is only a flat-rate salary for each (no
steps and no 2-tier salary plan). The sergeant salary is
$95,515 and the lieutenant salary is $100,814.

While the SOA contract recognition clause includes
captains, there are presently no captain positions in Roselle
Park, and no salary specified for one. However, unlike rank-
and-file patrolmen, superior officers do have a 2-tier benefits
plan. Officers hired after July 1, 2000 have a reduced level of
vacation, sick leave, personal leave.

Merit Incentive

Both superior officers and rank-and-file police have a
contractually based “merit incentive” plan, which provides
financial incentives for advanced education and specialized

training once an officer reaches five years of service with the
32

department. Officers obtain points based on levels of credit or
training obtained; each “point” is worth $11 of stipend money
added to salary each year (but not cumulative). The merit

incentive pay is capped at $1760 annual stipend.

Miscellaneous Stipends

In addition, officers and superiors each receive an annual
clothing allowance of $725, payable by separate check. Neither
contract provides for a separate longevity payment. in
addition, officers and superiors assigned to the detective
division or assigned as the traffic safety officer receive an
annual stipend of $1,500. The following chart provides a
snapshot, as of December 31, 2010, of all unit employees’

compensation:

Note: T have consolidated the rank-and-file together with superiors
for the purpose of this chart for ease of reading.

In addition to compensation and leave benefits, employees
in both negotiations units are covered by the hospital and major
medical insurance. Employees hired after September 1, 2007 are
limited to HMO health insurance but have the option of “buying
up” to a better plan. Employees contribute to the cost of

medical benefits pursuant to Chapter 78 at a rate of either 1.5%
ce)

of salary or a percentage of premium costs, whichever is
greater.

Medical coverage continues into the employee’s retirement,
provided he or she meets the years’ service criteria, at the
Borough’s expense.

Internal Comparables:

In early April, 2012, the Borough signed settlement
agreements with UAW Local 2326, which represents a negotiations
unit of the town’s clerical employees and a separate unit of the
town’s public works employees (Ex. RP-102, RP-103). Each
agreement provides for a four-year contract covering 2011
through 2014, with across-the-board salary increases of 0% in
2011, 2.08 in 2012, 1.75% in 2013, and 1.75% in 2014. In
addition, the memoranda of agreement provide for all unit
employees to change health care plans to the New Jersey State
Health Benefits program (no effective date specified), and to
discontinue payment for unused sick leave upon retirement for
new hires after January 1, 2012.

Pursuant to Article 14 of the PBA expired contract,
employees may take three personal days a year.’ The SOA expired
contract, however, provides a two-tier scheme for personal days
allotment. Superiors hired before July 1, 2000 received 3
personal days; employees hired after July 1, 2000, receive:

After completion of one year to completion of five

years - 1 day

After completion of five years to completion of ten

years - 2 days

After completion of ten years forward - 3 days
Both contracts require 24-hour advance notice, except in
the case of an emergency, and may only be taken if there is

sufficient manning to cover the employee’s shift. Both

contracts provide that unused personal days left at the end

‘The contracts provide: “Employees shall receive three (3) eight hour
personal days a year. (12 hour days for 12 hour personnel and 10 hour days
for 10 hour personnel) .”

  
 
   
  
  
 
 
41

of the calendar year may be cashed out at the daily rate

for an 8-hour day.

Holidays:

Both expired contracts provide at Article 12:

A. Each employee shall receive fifteen (15) holidays
per year in the following manner: Ten (10) paid
holidays at the regular rate of pay compensated at
eight (8) hours.

The additional holiday for 2006 and 2007 shall be

provided as compensatory time. Five (5) holidays to
be given as days off.

C. All paid holidays shall be included as part of the
annual salary for pension calculation and shall not
be added to base salary for payment of overtime.
Payment of holiday compensation will be made in the
regular pay periods.
In comparing the number of holidays in Roselle Park to other
communities in Union County, the Borough’s exhibits RP-85 and
RP-86 show that the average holiday benefit is 13.2 days. It

ranges from a low of nine days (Linden) to a high of sixteen

days (Berkley Heights and Elizabeth).

The current contracts for the PBA and the SOA provide,

A. In addition to the annual salary, a merit
incentive step payment program is hereby instituted
for all fourth (4th) grade patrolmen. Such merit
incentive step payment shall be determined according
to the following schedule.
 

* Must have obtained a minimum of an associate’s degree to qualify for this
additional compensation

B. The merit incentive points are to be awarded as
follows:

1. After January 1, 1980, each class hour at approved
courses of more than eight (8) hours conducted by
State, Federal or other training agencies outside
of departmental in-service programs and initial
recruit academy training- 1/15 point.

2. Each full year of service in the department - 1
point. This cannot be counted twice. If credit given
under longevity, cannot be applied here.

3. Each approved semester hour credit obtained in a
college, technical institute, or other institution of
higher learning in courses prescribed by the Chief of
Police with approval of the Borough Council - 1
point.

4. Qualifying average mark of eighty (80.0%) percent
or above average in annual in-service training
examinations — 1 point.

5. Recognized hours obtained in correspondence
courses prescribed by the Chief of Police with
approval of the Borough Council. Points to be
assigned each course prior to the commencement of
said course. Range from 2 to 6 points.

6. Associates Degree - 15 points.
7. Associates Degree in Police Science - 25 points.
8. Baccalaureate Degree - 35 points.

9. Baccalaureate Degree with Police Field Major - 50
points.

However, the maximum number of points that can be
amassed for any degree or combination of degrees in 50
points.

Cc. Points shall accumulate from date of appointment.
Points earned during the period January 1, through
December 31 are added and applied to the accumulated
point total in the succeeding year for any additional
compensation due. However, the additional
compensation shall not commence until completion of
service as a fourth grade patrolman.

D. Payment of merit incentive compensation shall be
included as part of the annual salary for pension
calculation and shall not be added to the base salary
for payment of overtime. Payment of merit incentive
compensation will be made in the regular pay periods.
The merit incentive program in this town is really a
composite of educational and training incentives, plus a

longevity program. Roselle Park does not offer a separate

stipend for longevity of any kind.

Sick Leave:

The current PBA and SOA contracts provides for fifteen days
of sick leave per year and an unlimited number of days for long-
term illness or disability. However, the SOA contract further
provides that, “Employees hired after 7/1/00 shall be eligible
for eighty hours per year.”

Overtime:

Article 6 of the expired PBA and SOA contracts contain the
following provisions concerning overtime:

B. Overtime shall be defined as all work beyond

regular tour of duty or all departmental time worked

during an employee's regular days off or time off.

Further, employees shall not be permitted to preserve
overtime worked (Article 6, Section B-1), by utilizing
“4

the Sick Leave conversion policy on either the first

day or the last day of their four (4) day tour of
duty.

DIscussIoON

I am required to make a reasonable determination of the

above issues giving due weight to those factors set forth in

N.J.S.A. 34:13A-16g(1) through (9) that I find relevant to the

resolution of these negotiations. These factors, commonly

called the statutory criteria, are as follows:

(1)

(2)

The interests and welfare of the public. Among the
items the arbitrator or panel of arbitrators shall
assess when considering this factor are the
limitations imposed upon the employer by (P.L.
1976, c. 68 (C. 40A:4-45.1 et seq.).

Comparison of the wages, salaries, hours, and
conditions of employment of the employees involved
in the arbitration proceedings with the wages,
hours, and conditions of employment of other
employees performing the same or similar services
and with other employees generally:

(a)

(b)

(c)

In private employment in general;
provided, however, each party shall
have the right to submit additional
evidence for the arbitrator's
consideration.

In public employment in general;
provided, however, each party shall
have the right to submit additional
evidence for the arbitrator's
consideration.

hospitalization benefits, and all other economic
benefits received.

Stipulations of the parties.

The lawful authority of the employer. Among the
items the arbitrator or panel of arbitrators
shall assess when considering this factor are
the limitations imposed upon the employer by the
P.L. 1976 c. 68 (C.40A:4-45 et seq).

The financial impact on the governing unit, its
residents and taxpayers. When considering this
factor in a dispute in which the public employer
is a county or a municipality, the arbitrator or
panel of arbitrators shall take into account to
the extent that evidence is introduced, how the
award will affect the municipal or county
purposes element, as the case may be, of the
local property tax; a comparison of the
percentage of the municipal purposes element,

or in the case of a county, the county purposes
element, required to fund the employees’
contract in the preceding local budget year with
that required under the award for the current
local budget year; the impact of the award for
each income sector of the property taxpayers on
the local unit; the impact of the award on the
ability of the governing body to (a) maintain
existing local programs and services, (b) expand
existing local programs and services for which
public moneys have been designated by the
governing body in a proposed local budget, or

(c) initiate any new programs and services for
which public moneys have been designated by the
governing body in its proposed local budget.

The cost of living.

including seniority rights and such other
factors not confined to the foregoing which are
ordinarily or traditionally considered in the
determination of wages, hours and conditions of
employment through collective negotiations and
collective bargaining between the parties in the
public service and in private employment.

(9) Statutory restrictions imposed on the employer.
Among the items the arbitrator or panel of
arbitrators shall assess when considering this
factor are the limitations imposed upon the
employer by section 10 of P.L. 2007, c. 62
(C.40A: 4-45.45).

In arriving at the terms of this award, I conclude that
all of the statutory factors are relevant, but not all are
entitled to equal weight. It is widely acknowledged that in
most interest arbitration proceedings, no single factor can be
determinative when fashioning the terms of an award. This
observation is present here as judgments are required as to
which criteria are more significant and as to how the relevant
evidence is to be weighed.

In addition, I note that N.J.S.A. 34:13A-169(8) requires
consideration of those factors ordinarily or traditionally
considered in the determination of wages, benefits, and
employment conditions. One such consideration is that the
party proposing a change in an employment condition bears the
burden of justifying the proposed change. Another
consideration is that any decision to award or deny any

individual issue in dispute, especially those having economic
47

impact, will include consideration as to the reasonableness of
that individual issue in relation to the terms of the entire
award. I am also required by statute to determine the total
net annual economic cost of the terms required by the Award.
In this matter, the interests and welfare of the public
must be given the most weight. It is a criterion that
embraces many other factors and recognizes the
interrelationships among all of the statutory criteria. Among
the other factors that interrelate and require the greatest
scrutiny in this proceeding are the financial impact of the
award, the restrictions on the employer by the appropriations
cap and the tax levy cap, the comparison of wages, other
compensation and benefits of Roselle Park’s police to other
similar jurisdictions, the cost of living and the internal

pattern of settlements within Roselle Park’s workforce.

The Employer’s Lawful Authority
and Statutory Restrictions, and
Financial Impact on Taxpayers:
g(5), g(6) and g(9).

Chapter 62, N.J.S.A. 40A:4-45 et seq, provides that a
municipality shall limit any increase in its annual budget to
2.5% over the previous year’s final appropriations unless
authorized by ordinance to increase it to 3.5%, with certain
exceptions. This is commonly referred to as the “Appropriations

Cap.” Chapter 68, N.J.S.A. 40A:4-45.45 prevents a municipality
from increasing the tax levy by more than 2% absent a public
referendum. This is commonly called the “tax levy cap.”

With regard to appropriations, the PBA and SOA note that for
2010, the Borough spent $123,279.15 less than budgeted for the
Police salaries and wages and other expenses line items. For
2011, the Borough’s police budget totaled $3,003,366 for salaries
and $247,850 for other police expenses representing a decrease
from the prior year of $63,280; or 2.06%. For 2012, the Borough
reduced these budgeted amounts to $2,995,000 for salaries/wages
but increased other police expenses by $50,000 to $297,850. This
resulted in an overall net decrease of $8,366 or .28%.

The PBA also points to the fact the Borough has continually
spent less than budgeted. The 2011 Audited Annual Financial
Statement indicates that $403,659.29 of prior year
appropriation/encumbrance reserves had lapsed into budget
operations for the 2011 budget year. 2010 unexpended
appropriation reserve balances of $469,294 will lapse to budget
operations in the 2012 budget year. In 2011, the Borough had
$395,406 in unexpended appropriate reserves which will lapse to
budget operations in the 2013 budget year.

In the 2012 budget the Borough utilized the full 3.5% COLA
rate ordinance to maximize the allowable spending cap limit at
$12,212,702.50 (including the 2010 Cap bank of $380,647.54 and

2011 Cap bank of $164,913.33). The Borough appropriated
$11, 378,259.00 leaving $834,443.50 ($12,212,702.50 less
$11, 378,259.00) of available spending in its cap bank for future
years spending.

The actual spending appropriation utilized would be limited
by the total anticipated revenues for the budget year which
include the amount to be raised by taxation for municipal
purposes as determined by the tax levy cap calculation. Since
the Borough had additional available tax levy of $481,981, the
Borough had the ability to appropriate.$481,981 of additional
spending and still remain below the maximum allowable
appropriations for 2012. The PBA argues therefore, that the
Borough does not have any spending Cap issues. The Borough has
available cap bank spending for the 2013 budget of $164,913
(Exh. M~17).

It also notes that the Borough had $169,512 of
unanticipated revenues, revenues, which is available for budget
appropriations in future years.

The PBA argues that the Borough is fully able to afford the
salary increases sought by the PBA and the SOA in that the
Borough has sufficient reserve funds and a large surplus revenue
balance. The PBA/SOA further argue,

In 2011, the beginning fund balance was $1,707,890.61

of which the Borough utilized $1,300,000.00 as surplus

revenue in the 2011 budget. This left the Borough with

an available fund balance of $407,890.61
($1, 707,890.61 less $1,300,000.00). In 2011 the
Borough was able to regenerate $1, 349,409.35 of fund
balance and the Borough ended the year with a
regenerated fund balance of $1,757,299.96 on December
31, 2010. This enabled the Borough to stabilize the
tax levy while complying with the statutory tax levy
cap.

The fund balance of $1,757,299.96 is available for the

2012 budget to hold down taxes and to fund the

requested PBA and SOA economic proposals. The 2012

budget plans to use $1,300,000.00 of the surplus

revenue. After using $1,300,000.00, the Borough will

still have a remaining surplus balance of $457,299.96

($1,757,299.96 less $1,300,000.00) available. (PBA

brief, p.50.

The PBA and SOA argue that there are sufficient funds
available, through reserves, to fund its contract without
impacting the tax cap levy. While the PBA takes note that the
municipal tax rate increased from 3.683 to 3.835 per $100 of
assessed valuation of residential property, or a total of $106.28
in 2011. However, it is quick to point out that the amount of
that increase attributable to the cost of police has increased by

only $47.92 per property (Ex. M-8).

The PBA also contends that the municipal portion of
Property taxes is 32%, while police services account for roughly
10.3% of the municipal tax bill or an estimated $843.06 dollars
a year based on the average tax bill. The Borough had a total
of $123,279.15 left in reserve from Police salaries and wages
and other expenses for the 2010 year. At the end of 2011, the
Borough had $79,833.56 left in reserve from Police salaries and
wages and $6,533.52 left in reserve from Police other expenses
totaling $86,367.08.

The 2012 Summary Levy Cap Calculation indicates that the
maximum amount to be raised by taxation (tax levy) was

calculated to be $11,385,428.00. The Borough elected to utilize
$2

only $10,903,447.00 to be raised by taxation for municipal
purposes, thereby forgoing $481,981.00 ($11,385,428.00 less
$10, 903,447.00) of available tax levy.

The amount of budget to be raised through taxation for 2011
was 70.4%, and 75.1% in 2012. The percentage has increased
every year since 2005 except one.

The PBA also notes that the employee health care
contributions resulting from the implementation of Chapter 78
will result in employee contributions of approximately
$44,634.75 in the first year, $85,234.20 in the second year,
$128,185.97 in the third year and $178,733.44 in the fourth year
(Ex. N-4). This is assuming that health benefits premiums do
hot increase beyond their 2012 levels, which is unlikely.

The Borough argues that in light of increases to
insurance costs, cuts in State aid, increased pension
contributions and the failing economy, its offer is both
fair and equitable. It maintains that the PBA’s
proposals would negatively impact the fiscal stability of
the budget because it fails to address these concerns.
Further, the Borough asserts that granting an economic
benefit in excess of the Borough’s proposal would
negatively impact on the Borough’s long-term tax
Stabilization plan. The Borough notes that it is

confronted with a number of difficult financial
$3

challenges. First, the Borough notes that its State aid
has been reduced since 2006 by $488,730. Further, it
notes that employer pension contributions have increased from
$353,290 in 2007 to $778,748 in 2011, $696,229 in 2012 and
$737,645 in 2013. It asserts that salary increases also
axiomatically increase employer pension contributions.

Further, the Town points to significant increases in
employee health care insurance. It notes that health care
costs (for all municipal employees) have increased from
$1,468,354 in 2009 to $1,940,317 in 2012. It also observes
that health care costs for retirees have roughly doubled in
the same three-year period.

In addition, the Town contends that the PBA proposal
fails to recognize that the Borough is facing losses in tax
appeals and its net valuation has decreased by just over
$4,000,000 in the past five years. Further, it notes that
tax collection receipts have slipped over the past six years
by .89%. However, it acknowledges that it has been able to
create a reserve which it intends to use to stabilize the
tax rate and cover tax appeals and increased costs.

In summary, the Borough contends that its final offer
provides a fair and equitable increase for employees while

recognizing the difficult financial circumstances the Borough
faces.

As the Supreme Court found in Borough of Hillside, and as
N.J.S.A. 34:13A-16 specifically provides, the impact on tax
payers, the appropriations caps and the tax levy cap, are al)
important consideration in the determination of my award.

For 2011, the only financial impact will be the payment of
employee increments; that is, to move five employees up to the
next step on the salary guide. This money has already been
appropriated and paid. Therefore, there is no impact for 2011.

For 2012, I intend to award across-the-board salary
increases of 2.0% to patrolmen and superiors. However, I also
intend to change the health care plan to New Jersey State
Health Benefits Plan effective July 1, 2012 or as soon
thereafter as practicable. This later move will save the
Borough approximately $300,000 in health care costs.
Additionally, I note that the actual total expenses for Lhe
police department salaries are decreasing in 2012 through
attrition. Therefore, there is no negative impact on the
budget or the tax levy for 2012.

In 2013, the Borough will begin to enjoy the full effects
of the savings realized from the transition to State health
benefits plan. Because this savings is substantial, it will

more than cover the impact of my 2.25% plus $725 award on wage
increases for 2013.

In 2014, my award of 2.0% across-the-board increases does
not exceed the 2% levy cap or the appropriations cap.
Additionally, the Borough will continue to experience the
savings in health care costs. Therefore, the financial impact
on the budget and the taxpayers of Roselle Park will be
minimal.

Stipulations of the Parties

The parties stipulated that, pursuant to the salary guide
in the expired contract, the Borough has paid the rank-and-file
salary increments in 2011 and are continuing to pay increments
as they become due on the employees anniversary in 2012. The
parties further stipulated that merit incentive payments have
been made in 2011 and 2012. These stipulations have been

incorporated into the factual findings above.

Terms and Conditions of Employment /Comparables

The PBA asserts that its proposed salary increases will
result in salaries that are more comparable to salaries earned
by officers of similar rank within Union County while the
Borough’s offer will create a large and growing disparity
between Roselle Park Police Officers and officers throughout the
County. It cites to five other municipalities where the top end

pay for patrolmen is higher than the $83,336 for Roselle Park
S6

patrolmen. Further, it notes that several towns in Union County
pay their sergeants and lieutenants better and sometimes
significantly better, than those in this SOA unit are paid.

The PBA/SOA also asks that I take notice of recent
arbitration awards in early 2012. In summary, those awards
(where there was no 2% cap on the arbitrator’s award) show an
annual average increase of 1.87%).

The Borough maintains that both the PBA members and the SOA
members are already highly compensated as compared with other
Union County municipalities.

I find that while one could always point to another
municipality whose officers are paid more, there are other towns
whose officers are paid less. On average, the maximum salary
for patrolmen in Union County for 2011 was $84,651 and for 2012
is $87,705. The current salary for Roselle Park’s top step
patrolmen is $83,336.

For sergeants, the average salary in Union County for 2011
was $99,110 and for 2012 is $102,263. The current sergeant’s
base pay in Roselle Park is $95,515.

For lieutenants, the average salary in Union County for
2011 was $112,197 and for 2012 is $115,308. The current
lieutenant’s base pay is $100,814.

As to salary increases, the average percentage increase in

Union County in 2011 was 2.54%; for 2012 was 2.96%; and for 2013
the average wage increase was 2.8%. However, it must be
remembered that these averages are based upon settlements that
may have occurred at any time in the past few years, and
therefore do not necessarily reflect current settlement trends.
More importantly, statistics issued annually by the Public

Employment Relations Commission, show the following settlement

rates:

   
 

1/1/2011-12/31/2011

1/1/2010-12/31/2010

 
 

Further as the PBA points out, the awards issued to date in

2012, where there was no 2% cap on the arbitrator’s award, show
an annual average increase of 1.87%.

Based on the foregoing statistical analysis of wages in
other jurisdictions, TI conclude that this factor of comparable
wages, together with the total compensation and benefits
package, is entitled considerable weight in reaching this award.
In addition, it is in the public interest, as well as continuity
of employment and the maintenance of employee morale, that

employees receive a fair commensurate salary to that of their
peers in similar jurisdictions.
Comparison to the Private Sector:

I give almost no weight to the component of
comparability with the private sector other than to observe
that New Jersey’s unemployment rate is about 9%, overall
wages are virtually stagnated, and any economic recovery
for everyone is slow to take root. On the one hand, police
are not subject to the same concerns as both private sector
or even public sector civilians in that layoffs are
infrequent and furloughs are non-existent. However, there
is no particular occupation, public or private, that is an
equitable comparison to police officers. The police
officers are unique in a variety of ways, including the
potential to be called upon to uphold the law at any time,
on and off duty; the ability to carry a weapon even off
duty; a unique recruitment and training process; the stress
and dangers of the job, and the lack of portability of
police officer skills beyond a certain age and beyond a
geographic region. They are frequently required to work
evenings, nights and holidays. Unlike the private sector,
they do not compete in a global economy, which tends to
depress wages.
internal Comparables:

The Borough argues that I must accord significant
weight to the settlement pattern among its civilian
employees. In early 2012, the Borough reached an agreement
with the clerical employee unit and a separate agreement
with the public works unit which included a wage freeze in
the first year, 2% in the second year, and 1.75% increases
in the third and fourth year.

In Borough of Hillside, 263 N.J.Super at 195
(app.div.1993), reversed in part, affirmed in part, 137
NJ. 71(1994), the court found that interest arbitrators
are required to give appropriate weight to internal
settlement patterns as such consideration furthers the
public interest. Accordingly, I intend to rely on the
settlement pattern established with the civilian employees,
both in terms of a wage freeze for 2011 and the migration
of employee health care coverage to the State Health
Benefits Plan.

Cost of Living

I am required to consider the cost of living as a
factor in rendering this award. N.J.S.A. 34:13A-16 (g)
(7): Borough of Hillside. Both parties recognize that the
cost of living is climbing. The PBA asserts that the 2012
Social Security COLA is 3.6% (Exh. M-25). The NJ State 2012
State Fiscal Year COLA is 2.5% (LFN 2011-23 Exh. M-25) and the

NJ State Length of Service Award Program (LOSAP) municipal CY
2011 COLA is 3.08 (LFN 2012-1 Exh. M-25). Moreover, the
National CPI for Urban Consumers calculates that there was 2.9%
increase over the last twelve months in the all items index,
mostly attributable to increasing energy costs. Further, the
PBA notes that as of October 2011, police will now contribute
10.0% of their pensionable base salaries to the PFRS instead of
the previous rate of 8.5%. The PBA argues that this increase
will diminish the disposable income of each PBA and SOA unit
member by an average of $1690 annually.

The Borough characterizes the increase in CPI as “minor”.
It asserts that its offer will continue to increase the
disparity in purchasing power between its police officers and
the average Union County consumer. It contends that the Town’s
police officers are already highly compensated compared to their
counterparts.

It must be noted that the CPI for 2010 and 2011 was
virtually flat, resulting in a zero COLA for Social Security
beneficiaries. This is in part the basis for my determination
to freeze wages for these employees for 2011. While the
employees did begin to contribute to the cost of health care
premiums in 2011, this in itself is not a factor leading to a
necessary salary increase for 2011. It was surely not the
intention of the legislature in passing Chapter 2 and Chapter 78

to have municipalities reimburse employees through salary
61

increases for the cost of their health care contributions.

While it is true that the cost of living is in fact beginning to
climb in 2012, my award takes this fact into consideration and
gives employees across the board increases in recognition of

this fact.

Continuity and Stability of
Employment Including Seniority
Rights and Such Other Factors
Traditionally Considered in
Determining Wages and
Employment Conditions: g(8):

Nothing in this award will negatively impact upon the
employee’s continuity of employment or the officers’ seniority
rights. In fact, the raises provided herein will allow the
Roselle Park police officers to maintain pace with the salary
and benefits of employees in their geographic area.
Additionally, because I have standardized the benefits package
between the rank and file officers and the superior officers,
internal continuity will be enhanced. To the extent that “area
standards” and “prevailing rate” are akin to comparability to
other jurisdictions, I have considered these factors above.

The Interest and Welfare

of the Public: g(1):

In my view, the interest and welfare of the public is not
only a favor to be considered, it is the factor to which the
most weight must be given. The public interest, of course

includes the amount of property taxes which homeowners and
62

businesses will be required to pay. It is for this reason
that Section g(1) specifically references the tax levy cap.
This award as a total package will allow the Borough to comply
with the appropriations and tax levy caps and will have a
minimal effect on the tax rate. This is of course in the
public interest.

Moreover, it is also in the public interest that the
municipal police force maintains a high degree of morale and
professionalism while performing their duties. I have
specifically considered this both in terms of the wage and
benefit package being awarded and in the maintenance of the
educational incentives program.

In the bigger picture, it is in the interest of the
public that it receives the highest quality of police
protection and services for the most reasonable price. This
award allows the Roselie Park police department to continue to
meet this goal. 1 will discuss the individual disputed
contract terms below.

Contract Duratica

The PBA and SOA propose a five~year contract for 2011-2015,
while the Borough proposes a three-year contract for 2011
through 2013. There is some attractiveness to locking in terms
and conditions for a longer contract period. I note that the

parties have been negotiating since the end of 2010 for this
successor contract. We are now almost a year and a half into
the successor contract period. A longer contract would provide
stability and predictability to terms and conditions of
employment, and would mean that the parties would not have to go
through the negotiations process again so soon.

However, the current economic climate is full of
uncertainty. No one can accurately predict whether the economic
health of the State will significantly improve or whether it
will deteriorate further by 2014. I find that a four year
contract strikes the appropriate balance between these factors
and is in the interests of the public. Therefore, I award a
four-year contract for 2011-2014.

Sealth Benefits:

Articie 11 of the current PBA and SOA contracts provides,

A. Hospital and Medical Insurance

The Borough shall provide all PBA employees and
their families with coverage for hospital and
major medical insurance. The Borough shall have the
right to substitute a different hospital and major
medical insurance carrier, providing that
replacement coverage is substantially similar to
that afforded by the current carrier. The Borough
shall bear the cost of all premiums for PBA employees
and their families. The deductible for medical
insurance indemnity coverage shall be $200.00
individual/$400.00 family.

1. Any employee hired on or after September 1, 2007
shall receive Borough paid HMO health insurance.

These employees shall have the right to a more
expensive plan by paying the difference in the premium
between the HMO and the Plan selected.
Retirement Coverage

1. The Borough shall pay the full cost of
such hospitalization and drug prescription program
insurance for a member of the PBA upon retirement
after twenty-five (25) years of pensionable service
that includes twenty (20) years of service with the
Borough or when a member of the PBA becomes disabled
in the line of duty. This coverage shall include
the member's spouse and children until they attain
the age of eighteen (18) and will remain in effect
until the member reaches the age of sixty-five (65)
years. The coverage shall be at the rate of the
least expensive premium for any family plans offered
by the Borough. Members who wish to participate in
the family plan at retirement in a plan offered by
the Borough and/or for children aged eighteen (18) to
twenty-three (23) that is more expensive shall pay
the difference between the least expensive premium
and the premium for the family plan selected by the
member. This benefit is not available to those
officers employed after September 1, 2007. Members
choosing not to receive insurance at retirement will
be entitled to receive a Five Thousand Dollar
($5,000) buyback per year until they reach age sixty-
five (65).

2. Upon the age of sixty-five (65) the member may
continue in the Borough's hospitalization and drug
prescription program provided he/she agrees to make
payments to the Borough Treasurer on a quarterly
basis, in advance.

3. This option shall remain open to a retiree at
age sixty-five (65) until the last day of the
calendar month in which his/her 65° birthday occurs.
Failure to exercise this option will result in the
forfeiture of continuance in the Borough's insurance
program.

C. Dental Plan

The Borough shall provide all PBA employees and
their families with dental coverage. The Borough
shall have the right to substitute a different dental
insurance carrier, provided that replacement coverage
is substantially similar to that afforded by the
carrier. The Borough shall bear the costs of ali
premiums for PBA employees and their families.

1. Newly hired employees, their wives, and children
shall not be entitled to the benefits of this dental
insurance program until the employee has completed
twelve (12) months of service with the Borough Police
Department.

D. Drug Prescription Program
The Borough shall provide all PBA officers and their

families with coverage under a drug prescription
program selected and determined by the Borough. The
Borough shall thereafter have the right to
substitute a different drug prescription carrier,
provided that replacement coverage is substantially
similar to that afforded by the current carrier. The
Borough shall bear the costs of all premiums for PBA
employees and their families.

Effective January 1, 2004 the co-pay for drug
prescription insurance shall be as follows for all
current employees and future retirees:

(a) Mail Order (90 day supply generic, $30.00 brand
name)

(b) Generic ($10.00)

(c) Brand Name ($15.00)

Section 5:

Effective January 1, 2004 any bargaining unit

employees who shall decline to be enrolled in the

medical program shall be entitled to receive the sum

of Five Thousand ($5,000.00) Dollars for each year of

the Agreement, in lieu of family coverage.

The Borough seeks to provide medical and prescription
coverage through the New Jersey State Health Benefits Program.
It asserts that the move will yield $300,000 in cost savings and
will also lower the employee premium sharing contribution as

required by Chapter 78, P.L. 2011.
I note that the recent settlements with the Borough’s
white-collar unit and the public works unit included a provision
for those employees to be enrolled in the State Health Benefits
Plan.

The chart below depicts the New Jersey (NJ) Direct 10
monthly premium for the PBA and SOA members estimated on 2012
base salaries as the PBA proposed them. The PBA states that
this will provide the Borough with significant increased savings

to offset future health care costs (PBA-M).

soon thereafter as could be locally implemented, public
employees are required to contribute to the cost of their health
insurance premiums at a rate of 1.5% of base (pensionable)
salary, or a percentage of the premium, as set by statute -
whichever is higher. This percentage of premium contribution

rate is phased in over four years and reaches a maximum of 35%
of the premiums by the fourth year. Here, the PBA and SOA
members began making premium-based contributions in July 2011,
as the contract expired at the end of 2010. Thus, by 2014, the
contribution rate for most PBA members (who are or will be at
the top step of the guide) and all of the SOA members will be
34% of the premium for family coverage.

Several conclusions can be drawn. First, as evidenced by
the Borough’s list of individual employee premium costs, most
employees in the unit opt for family coverage. For the patrolmen
at top step opting for family coverage, they will be
contributing 12% of the premiums in 2012 and, assuming a 2%
increase each year of the contract, they will contribute 26% of
premiums by 2014. For sergeants, the contribution for family
coverage in 2012 would be 14.5% and, in 2014, it will rise to
32%. The lieutenant contribution rate would be 16% in 2012 and
32% in 2014.

Comparing the contribution dollars based upon the existing
plans to those of N.J. State Health Benefits, not only is the
savings of total premiums significant, but the difference in
employee contributions is also significant.

Based upon a combination of the Borough’s premium costs for
Aetna and the PBA/SOA’s costs for Direct 10, the differences in

Premiums and employee contributions for family coverage are:
71

The difference in premiums - and thus cost to the Borough, is
very significant but cannot be precisely calculated absent a
complete list of employees with their respective coverage
options. Of the 23 patrolmen on the payroll for 2012, 7 are
eligible for Aetna coverage (hired after 7/1/07) and the
remaining 16 are eligible for Horizon. All of the current 7
superiors are eligible for Horizon coverage. Therefore, if all
of them opted for family coverage, the Borough would save
$47,306 on the Aetna enrollees ($6758 per person x 7) and
$320,436 on the Horizon enrollees ($13,932 per person x 23
employees), for a total savings of $367,742. The actual savings
of course, would be less because not all employees enroll in
family coverage. This is comparable to the Borough’s projected
savings of $300,000 in premiums by enrolling in NJ State Health
Benefits (brief, p.32). It should be noted this is money saved
annually.

Moreover, the direct savings to the employees in premium
sharing contributions is significant, as demonstrated above.
For the Horizon enrollees, it is an annual savings of more than
$1600 in 2012 and $3622 by 2014, for family coverage. For the
Aetna participants, the savings for 2012 for family coverage is
$811 and by 2014 the savings will be $1756.

Moreover, more than half of the municipalities in New

Jersey provide health care coverage through the New Jersey State
72

Health Benefits Plan. Based upon all of the foregoing, I
conclude that it is appropriate to award the Borough’s proposal
to provide coverage to the police units through the New Jersey
State Health Benefits Plan. While I recognize the PBA’s
argument that a measure of control - both the employees’
control, through negotiations, and the Borough’s control - will
be ceded to the State Health Benefits Plan, the cost savings to
the Borough and to the employees, is an overriding factor. In is
in the interest of the taxpayers and in the interest of the
employees. I also rely on the factor of internal comparability,
which weighs in favor of the Borough’s proposal, as the civilian
employees have agreed to the State Health Benefits Plan.

I do not award the PBA/SOA’s related language requiring the
employer to maintain “equal to or better than” coverage. The
existing language of “substantially similar”, while providing a
somewhat lower threshold for evaluating future changes, is
adequate protection.

The Borough seeks to modify the language for retiree
benefit eligibility by adding a requirement that the employee
must have worked for the Borough for 25 years before retirement.
The Borough submits that the cost of providing health care for
retirees is dramatically increasing. It seeks cost containment.

The PBA and SOA point out that such a requirement would

have the effect of keeping employees on the job longer, waiting
73

for their 25-year anniversary with the Borough. The impact of
this proposal would be on employees who have 25 years in PFRS
but not all of that time was served in Roselle Park. In fact,
neither party provided information about the current complement
of employees as to whether such a proposal would have any impact
at all on the Borough’s cost of retires’ benefits.

I consider that such a proposal, if any employees were
impacted by the proposal, would tend to deflate employee morale
because employees expecting to be able to retire with benefits
would be virtually forced to put additional years of service in
while marking time to their 25" anniversary. I agree with the
PBA and SOA that such a proposal would trade the cost of
retirement benefits for the cost of keeping a top-pay employee
on the payroll for additional years - and years that he might
not be particularly productive. This proposal is not awarded.

The Borough also seeks to require covered retirees to
contribute towards health coverage “pursuant to statute.”
Pursuant to Department of Community Affairs Local Finance Notice
No. 2011-20R, Chapter 78 requires retirees who retired after the
effective date of the law (6/28/11) to make a health benefits
contribution, which is deducted from their pension allotment.
However, employees are exempt from this contribution if they had

20 or more years of service in the retirement system by 6/28/11,
74

and were covered by a collective negotiations agreement (M-19,
p.9.)

As the benchmark for retiree health benefit contributions
is set forth in the statute, there is no need for me to consider
whether it needs to be incorporated in the PBA/SOA contract.
This proposal is not awarded.

The PBA and SOA also seek to add to the dental plan
contract language that the annual benefit shall be $2,000 per
year. Further, both units seek to add language extending
retirement coverage to those retiring with a disability
retirement and to extend the maximum age for dependents from 18
to 25. Insufficient information was provided to me to be able
to make a reasonable assessment of the impact and the cost of
these proposals. Therefore, these proposals are not awarded.
Wages

The PBA proposes across the board increases of 2.5% across-
the-board in 2011; 3.08 at top of guide and 1% for employees in
guide for 2012; $725 clothing allowance rolled into base plus
3.0% at top of guide and 1% for employees in guide for 2013;
3.0% at top of guide and 1% for employees in guide for 2014;
and 3.0% at top of guide and 1% for employees in guide for
2015. This would effectively advance the entire guide up by 5
percent for all employees, and would move the top step upwards

by an additional 10% percent, plus $725 in 2013. For the
7s

superior officers’ unit, the SOA proposes increases of 2.5%
2011, then a 3% increase in each year of a five-year contract
plus the $725 clothing allowance rolled into base beginning in
2013. This aggregates to a 14.5% increase over the life of the
five-year proposed contract.

The Borough proposes a 3-year contract, with a wage freeze
in 2011, then a 1% across the board increase in 2012 and a 1.5%
increase in 2013.

The cost of the PBA’s across the board increases for 2011,
aside from increments, total $43,960 in 2011 (1% increase for
11 employees still in-guide equals $6,460; plus $37,500 for the
15 remaining patrolmen in 2011 who were at the top of the
guide). Using the same formula (1%/3%) in each year of the

contract costs more each year.°

Of course, the cost of the
Borough’s proposal for 2011 would be only the cost of the
increments.

The total cost of the SOA proposal for 2011 can be
calculated as $5041 for 2.5% increase for the 2 lieutenants,
and $16,715 at 2.5% for the cost of the 7 sergeants. Again,

the Borough’s proposal at a wage freeze totals nothing.

For the reasons that follow, I intend to award a four-year

‘The PBA’s cost-out number use a different methodology: It takes
the aggregate payroll costs each year, and compares the total
year to year. The result of this method, while valid, shows
that the aggregate cost is decreasing in 2011 and 2012, because
of retirements and separations.
76

contract with a wage freeze in 2011, a 2% across-the~board
increase in 2012, a 2.25% across-the-board increase plus
ciothing allowance of $725 rolled into base in 2013, and a 2%
increase in 2014.

2011:

For 2011, the Borough’s civilian employees have accepted a
wage freeze. In Borough of Hillside, the Supreme Court noted
that internal comparables are an important component of the
public interest. Therefore, 1 give this factor considerable
weight. In addition, the Borough has financial constraints as
a result of the 2011 budget which included a 4.0% tax increase
in that year. While it is true that the Borough has surplus
left from 2011, a certain amount of surplus is desirable for
sound financial stewardship. In addition, any retroactive
increases I would award for 2011 would have to be paid in 2012
and thus would likely impact the 2012 budget.

It is noted that the Borough has already paid 2011
increments creating a fixed cost increase of roughly $50,000
(two new employees moving from the Academy step to the
Probation step at an increments of $8963 each; nine employees
receiving in guide increments of $5869 each), after accounting
for the pro-rating of increments as paid on the employee’s

anniversary.

Salaries from April 11, 2011.

2012:

In balancing the factors of comparability with similar
jurisdictions and internal comparables against the Borough’s
spending limitations, I find that a 2.0% salary increase is
appropriate.® This will bring the top pay for patrolmen to
$85,003 which will be more in line with Union County averages.
Additionally, the sergeant base salary will increase to $97,425
and the lieutenant will increase to $102,830. The cost of these
increases for 2012 totals $49,802 and the cost of the 2012
increments is $49,488. However, because of attrition, the total
compensation for both bargaining units is less than that of 2011.
in addition, if the Borough is logistically able to switch to the
State Health Benefits Plan in 2012, then the savings will well
more than cover the costs for these increases.

OTHER ECOMOMIC ISSUES

 

Superiors’ Leave Allotments

The evidence concerning comparable vacation allotments shows
that rank-and-file police as well as superior officers in the
“grandfathered” tier are on par with other Union County law
enforcement groups. In fact, 14 of the other police departments
surveyed have a vacation plan which, at the top end, is equal to
or in excess of that found in Roselle Park’s rank and file unit
and tier 1 superiors group. However, the chart also reveals that
for superiors hired after July 1, 2000 the vacation allotment is
well below the county average at every benchmark for years of
service. This is particularly true for superiors with 20 years of
service who only receive 16 days of vacation, an allotment which
is well below the County average of 25 days. It is also less than

any vacation allotment for superior officers in the County.

Pursuant to Article 14 of the PBA expired contract,
employees may take three personal days a year.’ Neither party
proposes to change the provisions of this article. The SOA
’The contracts provide: “Employees shall receive three (3) eight hour

personal days a year. (12 hour days for 12 hour personnel and 10 hour days
for 10 hour persornel).”
expired contract, however, provides a two-tier scheme for
personal days allotment. Superiors hired before July 1, 2000
received 3 personal days; employees hired after July 1, 2000,
receive:

After completion of one year to completion of five

years - 1 day

After completion of five years to completion of ten

years - 2 days

After completion of ten years forward - 3 days
Both contracts require 24-hour advance notice, except in
the case of an emergency, and may only be taken if there is
sufficient manning to cover the employee’s shift. Both
contracts provide that unused personal days left at the end
of the calendar year may be cashed out at the daily rate
for an 8-hour day.

The Borough’s exhibits Ex RP-83 and RP-84 show that
employees in fifteen other Union County municipalities have an
average of 3.13 personal days annually. Only two communities
(Clark and Linden) provide its employees with two personal days
and only two communities (Hillside and New Providence) provide
its employees with five personal days.®

The current SOA contract provides for fifteen days of sick
leave per year and an unlimited number of days for long-term

illness or disability. However, it further provides that,

 

"In New Providence, only officers hired before 1998 receive five personal
days. Employees hired after that year have only three days.
“Employees hired after 7/1/00 shall be eligible for eighty hours
per year.” The SOA seeks to eliminate this last sentence from
the contract; in effect, it seeks to eliminate the two-tier
benefit and provide all employees with the fifteen days
annually.

The SOA seeks to eliminate all of the two-tier leave
benefits in the SOA contract and put all officers in the higher
tier. It argues that such a two-tier scheme results in some
superiors having fewer leave benefits than rank and file, thus
reducing the incentive for patrolmen to seek promotions. I
agree. As time goes by, more and more superiors are or will be
in the Tier 2 for benefit eligibility. This disparity between
the rank and file and superiors provides a disincentive for
patrolmen to seek promotional opportunities, and is neither in
the interests of employee morale nor in the public interest. A
professional and highly effective police force is one where the
best and most skilled seek opportunities to become leaders in
the department. Therefore, I award the elimination of the two-
tier vacation leave, personal leave and sick leave benefits.
All superior officers will be advanced to the higher tier
effective January 1, 2012.

Credit for Unused Sick Leave
Additionally, both the PBA and the SOA propose new language

as follows:
87

If an officer does not use a sick day in a calendar

quarter, he shall receive one compensatory day for

each such quarter. The compensatory day shall be

credited to the officer within one week of the end of

the applicable quarter and shall be equal to the

number of hours in the officer’s regular workday.

Article 16C of the PBA contract provides,

Cc. Upon retirement, an employee may elect to receive

a cash payment equaling one (1) day's regular base

pay for each three (3) days of unused sick leave time,

up to a maximum of two hundred (200) days and payout

not to exceed $4,500.00.

Article 16A of the SOA contract provides,

C. However, upon retirement, an employee may elect to

receive a cash payment equaling one (1) day’s regular

base pay for each three (3) days of unused sick leave

time, up to a maximum of two hundred (200) days and

payout not to exceed $6,000.00 even though the

employee may accrue unused sick leave beyond the

maximum of two hundred (200) days.
The Borough seeks to modify the provisions in each contract to
cap the payment of unused sick leave upon retirement at $1,500
except that, to the extent employees have already accrued
balances above this amount, those employees shail be
grandfathered and frozen at their existing balances. In
addition, the Borough seeks to eliminate this benefit for
officers hired after January 1, 2011. The employer offers no
rationale for this proposal except as an obvious cost-saving
measure.

The PBA argues that this benefit has long been counted on

as part of the employee’s package going into retirement. It also
notes that this payment upon retirement encourages employees to
conserve their sick leave time and use it only when absolutely
necessary so that it will be there upon their retirement. It
also notes that the legislature passed a bill which would cap
such payments upon retirement at $15,000 - a far higher cap than
the ones in place here.

The cost for this program is not significant. At most, the
two retirements from the force in 2011 cost the town $10,500.
Again, I consider this as but one of the pieces of the total
compensation package officers in Roselle Park enjoy. By
comparison with many towns, where the dollar cap is either much
greater or non-existent, this town has kept the cap on this
benefit low.

Based on the above, I decline to change the existing
benefit of payment for sick leave upon retirement. Similarly, I
do not feel it necessary to enrich the sick leave benefit by
giving officers a quarterly award of 1 compensatory day for not
taking a sick day. In light of the existing cash out of sick
time upon retirement, there is no need for an additional
inducement for employees to refrain from taking sick leave.
Accordingly, both of these proposals are denied.

Molidays
In comparing the number of holidays in Roselle Park to

other communities in Union County, the Borough’s exhibits RP-85
and RP-86 show that the average holiday benefit is 13.2 days.
It ranges from a low of nine days (Linden) to a high of sixteen
days (Berkley Heights and Elizabeth).

The Borough proposes to reduce the number of paid holidays
from 15 to 13. The Borough has not provided sufficient
justification for granting this proposal.

I find that paid holidays is part of the overall
compensation package for police. The number of holidays enjoyed
by these officers is not excessive compared with other towns.
In fact it is right in the middle of the range. In addition,
only 10 of the holidays are paid in monetary compensation; the
rest are given as days off. Unlike civilian workers, police
officers do not usually have the luxury of spending holidays
with family and friends, as police work is a 24/7 operation.

In balance with rest of the unit members’ compensation package,
I decline to reduce the holiday pay benefit.

Merit Incentive:

The merit incentive program in this town is really a
composite of educational and training incentives, plus a
longevity program. In comparing the educational incentives
offered in Roselle Park to those offered in other Union County
communities, as shown in the Borough’s exhibits RP-100 and RP-
101, it appears that Roselle Park’s maximum incentive pay of

$1,760 is above the county average of $1,377 for a bachelor’s
degree, but is between the low of $1,000 and the high of $1,900.
It is noted that unlike many other towns, there is no
educational incentive pay in Roselle Park for the achievement of
a master’s degree, which averages $2,900.

In Roselle Park, there are 21 employees -- patrolmen and
sergeants combined -- who are receiving at least some
compensation annually from this program. Their combined point
totals for 2012 incentives had a minimum of 40-5/15 points up to
a maximum of 226-11/15 points (PBA-2). Actual cash value of the
incentive pay for 2012 ranged from $330 (for the lowest number
of points) to a maximum of $1,760 (maximum possible incentive
allowance). In 2012 the Borough’s cost for the incentive
program was $25,420, for an average per employee benefit of
$1,210.

The PBA and SOA merely seek to maintain the status quo
concerning the merit pay incentive program. The Borough seeks
to suspend the program entirely for the successor contract
period and to eliminate it altogether for employees hired after
January 1, 2013. Other than cost savings, the Borough has not
advanced a rationale or documentary evidence to demonstrate why
this benefit must be eliminated.

I note that, unlike most municipal police units, there is
no separate longevity program in Roselle Park. A typical

longevity payment in New Jersey law enforcement ranges from 1%
91

to 4% of base salary, depending on the town and employee’s
length of service. Thus, a longevity benefit in most towns
costs the town more than the total merit incentive benefit here,
which combines longevity and educational incentives. I must
consider the merit incentive benefit in conjunction with the
overall compensation package employees currently receive, as
well as the package awarded herein.

It appears to me that, as many other towns have recognized,
well-educated, well-trained officers contribute an added value
to the professionalism and skills of the police force as a
whole, and cannot be undervalued. This inures to the public
interest. Moreover, the officers in the existing Roselle Park
Police force worked long and hard for the educational credits
and training they attained, with an expectation, pursuant to the
contract, that their efforts would be recognized and monetarily
rewarded. It would be unfair and detrimental to morale to now
suspend that financial reward - even for the period of one
contract-without a significant basis to do so. Therefore, the
Borough’s proposal must be rejected.

Bours of Work and Overtine

Article 6 of the expired PBA and SOA contracts contain the
following provisions concerning overtime:

B. Overtime shall be defined as all work beyond

regular tour of duty or all departmental time worked
during an employee's regular days off or time off.
92

Further, employees shall not be permitted to preserve

overtime worked (Article 6, Section B-1), by utilizing

the Sick Leave conversion policy on either the first

day or the last day of their four (4) day tour of

duty.

1. Only vacation days, holidays, compensatory days,

personal days, and bereavement days can be utilized to

preserve overtime that has been worked within a given
forty (40) hour work week. Only in this instance

will the advance notification and approval of the use

of vacation days, holidays, compensatory days,

personal days, and bereavement days be waived in

order to preserve overtime within a given forty (40)

hour work week.

The PBA and SOA both seek to eliminate the last sentence of
Section B above concerning the sick leave conversion policy. In
effect, it argues that an officer who works overtime on any day
of the workweek should not forfeit payment for that overtime
because he took a sick day the same week. The Borough seeks to
base overtime on only work hours actually worked excluding all
sick time.

Neither party has provided documentary evidence concerning
the costs of overtime to backfill for absences or the extent to
which sick time is used for either bargaining unit. Therefore,
I cannot adequately evaluate the respective proposals. Further,
while I can see some merit to the positions of both parties, I
believe the existing language is a reasonable compromise between

excluding all sick time from the overtime computation and

excluding none of it. Therefore, I decline to award either of

 
93

these proposals.

Further, the Borough seeks to exempt lieutenants from
overtime eligibility altogether contending that they are
management executives. This argument requires an application of
the Fair Labor Standards Act and is not an issue properly before
me. And, even assuming that the FLSA does not require overtime
for these positions, the history of this bargaining unit
requires the continuation of overtime pay, absent compelling
evidence supporting that proposal. The Borough’s proposal is
not so supported. The proposal is denied.

Travel Reimbursement

Articles 13 of the expired contracts provide that employees
required to use their personal vehicles for police business will
be reimbursed $.22 per mile for such travel. The PBA and SOA
seek to increase the travel rate to the IRS rate, which is
currently $.55 per mile. The PBA and SOA argue that the
existing rate is woefully inadequate to compensate employees for
the use of their personal vehicles. It asserts that employees
should not have to pay for gas and vehicle maintenance when the
travel is for Borough business. I agree. The existing
contractual rate is less than half of the federally set rate for
auto expenses. Employees should not have to pay auto expenses

to the Borough’s benefit. 1 award this change.
Work Schedules:

The Borough seeks to standardize the workday for all
employees at 12 hours. The PBA contends in its brief that most
employees either work a 4/3 or a 3/4 schedule of 10- or 12-hour
days, while some officers are on 8-hour schedule, 5 days a week.
No information has been provided as to how many employees are on
which schedule. Further, no rationale has been advanced
concerning continuity of supervision, training, accountability,
overtime cost savings, or weekend availability of the detective
squad which might support such a proposition. Further no
financial impact analysis have been put forth to support such a
proposal. The proposal is denied.

Side Jobs

The PBA and SOA propose to include the contents of the
Borough’s ordinance concerning side jobs into the contract, and
to increase the rate by $2 per hour. They also seek to require
payment of a time and one half overtime rate for work beyond 8
hours, on an overnight shift, on major holidays or on jobs with
less than 4 hours’ notice. Further, they seek to increase the
Board of Education rate to $45 per hour.

The supporting documentation for this proposal, proposed
Exhibit N, was not submitted until after the hearing, and

therefore, was not considered. This proposal is denied.
MOMN-ECOMOMIC ISSUES
Grievance Arbitration Procedure

The PBA and SOA seek to modify the Grievance Arbitration
Procedure, at Article 5. Each seeks to include a specific list
of agreed-upon arbitrators directly in the arbitration
provisions rather than, as currently the case, selecting an
arbitrator from a list supplied by the Public Employment

Relations Commission. The expired contracts provide,

ARTICLE S: ARBITRATION PROCEDURE

A. Either party, the Borough or the PBA, may apply
to the New Jersey Public Employment Relations
Commission for the appointment of an arbitrator.

B. Following notice of intent to arbitrate has been
forwarded to the Borough, the PBA or its
representative shall file with the New Jersey
Public Employment Relations Commission (PERC)
requesting a list of arbitrators be forwarded to
the parties. This shall not preclude the parties
from mutually agreeing to utilize the services of a
specific arbitrator; however, should the parties so
desire, the name of the arbitrator shall be
forwarded to PERC for appointment pursuant to its
rules. Should the parties choose not to agree upon
a specific arbitrator, then appointment shall be
made by PERC and in accordance with its rules.

The PBA and SOA argue that this revision to the arbitration
ciause would streamline the arbitrator selection process and
permit a core group of arbitrators to become familiar with the
issues and nuances of the parties’ relationship. The Borough

has advanced no contrary argument concerning this issue. The
PBA’s and SOA’s position has merit: First, it would accelerate
the selection of an arbitrator; the parties would not have to
solicit a list from PERC, rank their preferences, and
potentially obtain a second list of arbitrators and do the same.
Second, the PBA and SOA are correct that a small group of
arbitrators dealing with the same employer-employee relationship
would become familiar with the contract and the local issues.
Greater continuity and predictability would result. I observe
that the parties have already used this procedure on a more
limited basis by inserting the name of one particular arbitrator
into their hours of work clause to resolve disputes concerning
the potential reversion to a prior work schedule. Third, the
provision, as the Union proposes, provides an escape provision
in that, if the parties fail to agree on a standing list of
arbitrators, they will revert to the PERC panel method of

arbitrator selection. I award this proposal.
