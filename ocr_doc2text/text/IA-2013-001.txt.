This case assignment was made by the N. J. Public Employment Relations Commission
pursuant to the imposition of specific considerations and regulations of the N. J. State
Legislature which are instructive to the parties and to this arbitrator. It is my
understanding the 2% limit for annual wage increases per se under the statute will not be
imposed in this situation, due to the contract expiration date being December 31, 2010,
however, the 2% limit on the enlargement of property taxes is in effect and must be
considered.
Introduction to the unusual circumstances surrounding this dispute are in order. The
Borough is a small community on the shore of New Jersey. It encompasses only just less

than one square mile. It is essentially a summer resort environment with a population
jumping from year round occupancy of only 25% to a full 100% or greater due to visitors
during summer months. There is little in the way of any industrial development but a
substantial emphasis on recreational and services employment. Much of the work of
police in the non-summer months is devoted to local security of properties 75% of which
are unoccupied by owners whose year-round homes are elsewhere. It is a shore
community bordered by the ocean and is a small part of the recreational center of
attraction for New Jersey residents and visitors.

Surf City was 16th in rank of 566 municipalities state wide as to a “wealth of resources”
index and was 7th of Ocean County communities having a per capita tax base of
$1,441,019 in June of 2012.

STATUTORY FACTORS

The required consideration of the arbitrator includes topically each of the following
factors. I shall set them forth bere in abbreviated form so as to reduce the space devoted
to that exercise. However, the overriding instruction to the arbitrator is the requirement
for him to establish and generally state which of these factors he has determined to be
relevant and which not particularly so and to express reasoning for those determinations.

1. The interests and welfare of the public. Including any limitations imposed upon the
employer which are relevant.

2. Comparison of wages, salaries, hours and conditions of work with others similarly
employed or with others generally. In private or public sector employment in general and
in employment in similar or comparable jurisdictions to include wages and the entire range
of economic benefits.

3. The overall compensation of employees including wages and benefits,

4. Any stipulations of the parties.

5. The lawful authority of the employer including limitations imposed by law.

6. The Gnancial impact on the governing unit, its residents, taxpayers and the impact on
the property tax levy. How the award would impact on property taxes, purpose elements
of taxation particularly in comparison with prior years and the impact on taxpayers at
varying income levels. The effect of an award on the governing body as to its programs
and services and ability to maintain same; potential impact on a local budget and in
particular the potential impact on new programs or services if proposed for a new budget.
7 The cost of living.

8. The continuity and stability of employment including the impect on factors traditionally
considered in determination of collective negotiations in public or private sectors.
9 Statutory restrictions imposed on the employer including limitations resulting from
legislation. Among the items which shall be assessed are the limitations imposed upon the
employer by section 10 of P.L. 2007,062 (C40A:4-45.45).

The interests and welfare of the public.

This factor can not be ignored and as the public can be quick to complain if the situation
arises it must be given consideration. However the public seem to be very satisfied with
the Borough's leadership. Taxes have been consistently under control and services,
particularly police services, have been of an exceedingly high level with very little in the
way of complaints. The physical plant of the Borough is well attended and the citizenry
appears to enjoy the services afforded by ail and in particular the protective practices of
police. I find this to be a meaningful factor for evaluation but have no evidence of any
discomfort by the citizenry. In particular there appears to be a good deal of confidence in

Comparison of wages Hours etc.

This is a police function of only eight persons reporting to the chief. The compensation
for this group is very competitive for new hires and the positions, if open, would not lack
for applicants. However the competitive comparison fades as employees move through the
salary structure at least as to basic salary. In this category the pay at Surf City is very near
the bottom when contrasted with other employers in the general area. This is known to
the Borough and there is no discomfort in their view at being near or st that bottom.
Admittedly the work demands at a Borough which is much less demanding than that found
in a major city allows this view. And although the Union and officers would prefer the
wages were more competitive there is a sense of trying to move up the relative economic
ladder to a higher compensation level but not a feeting of despair, rather one of wanting to
be more generously paid for the good work performed. Otherwise the conditions of work
are enviable and the relationships sound. I see this as a criteria of interest but not one
officers appear to be comfortably performing without complaint or stress.

This criterion is largely addressed in the foregoing paragraph and I do not feel it requires
much further discussion. These employees receive a comprehensive and generous package
of benefits including insurances. With the possible exception of a more competitive salary
structure | would conclude they should be very pleased with their employment.

There were no stipulations of the pasties.

The lawful authority of the employer including limitations imposes under law.
The discussions in this arbitration proceeding have revealed that there should be no
modifications awarded which would have a deleterious impact on any function of the
Borough. The potice function is relatively small and the overall fiscal condition of the
Borough so sound that it is virtually unlikely that an award will bestir any threats to the
authority of the Borough or issues having to do with limitations imposed by law. It is a
criterion which deserves attention but is found not to raise issues here.

In support of this conchusion I note the following: Tax collection rates have consistently
been at or around 98+% for five years: The fund belance has increased each o the past five
years and is anticipated to be $3,622,870 for 2012: The unencumbered fund balance has
exceeded $2,131,000 for four years including 2012: The anticipated fiscal year surplus in
2012 is in excess of $3,623,000: The current tax levy is below the CAP by more than
$155,000. Ail of these figures help to present a general picture of financial soundness. It
is for this reason that I do not place heavy emphasis on this criterion.

The financial impact on the governing unit.

I find this to be of no great consequence as my award will not disturb any property tax
circumstance. The Police budget is too small to disturb the financial planning of the
Borough. I see no interference with regard to ongoing programs or services and no
significant impact on property taxes. It is my intention to provide an award which
delivers a reasonable increase in base pay which should not produce any extreme impact
on the overall budget and be viewed as deserved given all circumstances affecting these
employees.

The cost of living.

The cost of living has risen slightly in recent months but still hovers at around 2%. What
the future will bring is anybody's guess but it is unlikely to change dramatically and a
reasonable increase in base pay should serve to assist these employees needs. The fact
that the Legislature has undertaken a role involving certain elements of income can not be
of my concer as that suthority has indicated those actions are intended to be imposed oa
limited targets due to past history of events. Had the Legislature intended that other than
police and fire personnel share those costs it could have directed the employing authority
accordingly.

The continuity and stability of employment.

I see this criterion as significam when terms of an award are likely to be seen as improper.
This award will provide a reasonable level of wage improvements in an environment where
those improvements are clearly affordable and where the comparative wages for like
employment in surrounding communities provides a reasonable basis for comparison as is
the case here.
Statutory restrictions imposed on the employer.

imperil and statutory restrictions imposed by the legislature or stimulate any charge to the
effect that there has been an abuse of the underlying concepts of a reasoned award.

The Police Department has a Chief and provision for sergeant rank but no employes
beyond the rank of patrol officer. Of the eight at that level five were at the top step in
terms of salary level in 2011 and 2012 with a sixth joining that step in 2013.

The Borough is generally very disciplined as to its financial condition and takes pride in
having accumulated a surplus of $3.5 Million which is in sharp contrast to a budget of

the confines of fiscal resources. It defends this on the basis of experience having to do
with major unanticipated costs due to the vagaries of ocean-front exposure to costly
storms damage as have befallen neighboring communities on Long Beech Island, where
losses and repairs have amounted to hundreds of thousands of dollars as, for example,
Harvey Cedars spent $550,000 beach repair and Township of Brick spent $1,500,000
for storm related damage repairs. Thus it is a conservative fiscal policy which is said to be
and other costly property damage and which, if not corrected immediately, could imperil
normal operations in the few months available in each financially precious summer season.

The final proposals of the parties.
The PBA presented a list of final proposals on September 4, 2012 as follows.

t. A new Agreement with wage increases of 3% in 2011, 3% in 2012, 2.5% in 2013 and
2014.

2. The removal of the longevity clause from the past agreement and replacing that section
with a roll in of those scheduled costs into base pay along with the creation of an entirely
new salary guide.

3. The PBA also proposed an alternative modification which would leave the longevity
clause as it has been in the prior Agreement and provide 3% bese salary increases in each
of the four years, 2011 through 2014.

Non- Economic Proposals.
|. Add this language to the Management Rights clause; at Section A....following rights...

Agreement”
4. Article 5. Grievance Procedure.

Section A. Add after The parties shall have 30 days to file for arbitration, “after it is

next year which must be used.”

7. 12- Leaves and Holidays

Add. “The Borough shall provide three months salary to any spouse or children of the

PBA seeks to increase the uniform allowance by $25 in each year of the agreement.

9. 18-Maintenance of operations.

C. Nothing contained in this agreement shall be construed to, ‘limit or restrict the
Borough or PBA in its right to seek and obtain" judicial relief as it may be entitled as to

law or inequity for injunction or damages, “or both in the event of such breach by the
association or the Borough".
The Borough proposals were much fewer and were not formalized in a post hearing brief
although discussed at length at the final meeting of the parties with the arbitrator. This
lack of formal confirmation has been objected to by the Union particularty as changes
were incorporated which could have influenced the length of the new contract, the wage
improvements offered and the status of the proposal conceming the issue of the roll in
scheme as a way to eliminate the longevity provision of the past contract. The proposal
having to do with financial matters included a demand to eliminate longevity by reducing
the then current allowances for each person now receiving longevity to 30% of that dollar
amount and adding it to such individual's pay. It was understood that officers who were
not receiving longevity pay or future employees would not be entitled to such in the
future. [t was also noted that the amount of any roll over would then be frozen and not
later expanded.

The borough proposal as to wage increases had been 2% for each year in a four year
contract. During the later discussions and in related paperwork the 2% was spoken of as
the last offer but there came a time when the 2% was reduced to 1% and the four year
contract term changed to a three year offer. Neither of these changes was actually
formalized and the post hearing material was extremely vague. However | am of the

There is one element of this situation which bares heavily on any conclusion I might
advance. The Union descrides its proposal regarding the roll in of longevity into bese
salary as to costs without noting the fact that the longevity plan would be continued for all
present and future employees except that the values would have been reduced to 80% but
the plan expenses would continue. I note this is in sharp contrast to the offer made by the
Borough wherein the amount to be rolled over was to be 30% of the then current
entitlement with no future adjustments. Thus there is a world of difference between the
two proposals. In addition it should be recognized thst the intended plan of the Union
would substantially affect the ultimate costs of the enhanced pensions for all present and
future employees. This must be seen as contrary to the intent of the Legislature where it
has taken steps to reduce such expenditures. The further fact that current employees have
not contributed to the higher sverage earnings which would follow suggests the State
would demand higher contributions to justify these higher averaged levels of pensionable
income. A resuk which, as noted above, would be contrary to the State’s objectives and
which would result in shifting the higher contribution levels required to the Borough..

All of this has led me toward consideration of an alternative plan such as was proposed by
the Union. That is, to set in place a more conventional resolution of this dispute
particularly as the Union had indicated that course of action could be a means of
settlemem. I have not fully resolved this point in my mind but the much greater potential
costs of the roll in proposals, particularly that of the PBA plan, clearly suggest an
alternative would be in order. This is especially true when one takes into consideration the
roll over concept was first advanced by the Borough but in such form as to be totally
unaccpetable to the Union. It would have placed an immediate reduction of that benefit as
well as the elimination of gradual increases as a function of years of service and would
have provided no benefit for future employees.

I have reviewed the available data which had been the besis for the Union's claim that the
wages paid in Surf City for police were significantly below the going rates in nearby
communities. I found the claim to be accurate as had been confirmed by the employer.
For example the 2010 top of the range in Surf City was $81,733 whereas the top pay in
Barnegat was $87,189; the top pay in Ocean Township was $85,161 and Bamegt peid
$87,189. This was replicated elsewhere and known to the Borough which had reacted by
stating, “..some one had to be at the bottom”, but by a margin of approximately 5% or
more in some cases. This record contains an indication of the Borough having
consumated negotiations with another unk of its employees which included annual
increases of 3% albeit on different terms.

It is of note that the Union advanced a proposal for four years with increases of 2.5% in
the first two years, 2011 and 2012 and then 2.0% in 2013 and in 2014. This offer was
made as part of a package which included the roll over concept which I have dismissed.

When pressed by the arbitrator for an alternate proposal excluding any roll over the Union
responded with a proposal for a four year plan with increases of 3% in each year, and no
change as to inclusion of a roll over concept, for the years 2011 through 2014.

During these difficult discussions the Borough spoke first of a counter proposal of 1.5% in
each of four years though that was modulated later to 1% in each of two years. The post
hearing brief of the Employer was not explicit on this point. However, what is obvious is
that an award of the latter of the Borough's offers, a two year term would mean there
could be no Agreement as s00n as January 1, 2013 for a successor contract. This would
make no sense as the parties would already be delinquent in renewing negotiations.
Viewing this matter from another angie with renewed focus on the roll in plan proposed
by the Borough, ! find no justification which supports those Employer's proposals. The
granting of the proposal to adopt the roll over plan on the terms offered can not be
justified as I noted above as it would mean a substantial loss to all employees affected
without any alternative gain. Given the financial condition of this employer such a move
simply could not be endorsed by the arbitrator.

Thus I find mysetf confined to the determination of an alternstive but just solution. In
arriving at this conclusion I tumed my attention first to the offers of the Union. One was
the abandonment of the change in the longevity plan and instead incorporation of 3%
annual increases for the full four years of a new agreement. This would continue the
Current provisions for longevity increases of approximately $57,000 during the four years
of such proposed contract or something less than $14,000 per year on average. These
figures would move higher as changes in base wages might influence them. However,
given the 2011 total wage base of approximately $600,000 the annual cost impticstion is
small, less than 3 tenths of one percent per year. Given the prevailing negative attitude as
to wage increases eminating both from the Borough and from the Legislature I am
OPINION AND OVREVIEW
Here [ tum my attention to the demands of the Union. The first of these has to do with
the financial elements and duration of a new contract. As noted above it is my conviction
that nothing is gained by limiting an award to two years and I firmly believe such would be
a disservice both to the parties, who need to have a period of peace, and to the arbitration
process as advanced by the Legislature and the Public Employment Relations Commission.

Economic demands of the Union

1. Salary changes for, 2011,2012, 2013 and 2014.
2. Clothing allowance to be expandad by $25 in each year of the contract

Non-economic demands of the Union inclusive of my determinations 2s to incorporation
in the forthcoming contract, in whole or as | may modify each. Some with explanations.

1. The language changes as to the Management Rights clause are rejected because of the
potential conflict as to rights for litigation of issues within contract procedures being
extended to issues beyond the Contract and reserved for the courts. The “just cause”
language is to be incorporated in the contract.

The added language suggesting, “subject to State and Federal law in this Agreement
appears to be either unnecessary or potentialy expansive beyond the State and is rejected.

2. As to Article 5 concerning Grievance Procedure The addition of the clause providing
30 days to file for arbitration is approved and the following clause is also approved, “.after
it is known or should have been reasonably known that the grievance was denied at the
last step proceeding arbitration.” The remainder of that submission is not approved.

3 The Article 8, Section F. submission is denied. Too vague and undefined and
questionable as to source of authority involved.

4. As to vacation days being carried over, this should have been negotisted as to time
limits and as written is rejected. This issue was never presented to the Borough or to me
during earlier meetings as would have been appropriate.

5. This clause regarding rights of officers Sectiof F. is also written in too widely
encompassing language and is rejected.

6. That portion which provides for three months salary in case of death of an officer
during line of duty is approved and ordered. The remainder is too broad and without
limits or other condtions and is rejected.

7 ~The addition of the words “or the PBA" in the entitlement phrase is approved

10
8. This request appears to relate to entitlements already known. Why then add further

language. And the preliminary, “Nothing in this Agreement..” raises a question as to
allegiance to the terms of the contract. It being either contra-indicative or vague. It is

rejected.

Any and all other non-economic demands which may have been advanced by the Union
are rejected.

Economic demands of the Borough.

The proposal of the Borough as to economic increases was somewhat unclear at the last
consultation of the parties however I was of the conviction that the wages proposal was
for 2% in each of two contract years. this offer also included the adjustment of the
longevity to placing all current recipients of longevity on a new agreement which in cluded
their currenpay with 30% of the longevity pay as a new salary. No new longevity
entitlement would ever be added to that peckage and for any employees who had not yet
begun to beentitled none would ever be granted. New employees would have no
entitlement either, regardless of years of service before being hired. The longevity pay
rolled into salary would extend as base salary into retirement if otherwise entitled and
would be part of base salary for computation of any salary increases.
AWARD
There shall be a four year Agreement inclusive of 2011, 2012, 2013 and 2014.
There shall be wage increases of 2.5% effective on January first of each year.

There shall be an annual increase of $25 for maintenance of uniforms paid in each year on
of about July first.

Any and all other demands are denied.
