PROCEDURAL HI Y

Police Benevolent Association Local 309 (the “PBA™) and the Borough of Bergenfield (the
“Borough”) are parties to a Collective Negotiations Agreement with an effective term of January |,

2016 through December 31, 2017 (the “Agreement”).

The partics met for negotiation sessions on September 29, 2017, November 1, 2017, and
February 15, 2018. The Parties submitted to mediation before Public Employment Relations
Commission ("PERC") Director Mary Beth Hennessy- Shotter, on May 9, 2018 and July 9, 2018 which

was not successful in resolving the dispute.

The Borough filed a Petition to Initiate Compulsory Interest Arbitration with PERC on August
1, 2018. PERC appointed Ira Cure, Esq. ("Arbitrator Cure") as Arbitrator. Mr. Cure conducted a
mediation session with the Parties on September 7, 2018 which was also not successful in resolving the
dispute. The Parties attempted to schedule the arbitration, but no mutually agreeable date for a hearing
could be scheduled within the 90-day period required by law. The Parties submitted a joint request to
withdraw the Borough's initial petition and the Borough re-filed the instant Petition. On October 1,
2018, PERC appointed me as Arbitrator. On October 22, 2018, a mediation session was held as
required by the act. Since all issues were not resolved through the mediation, a formal Interest
Arbitration proceeding was conducted on November 20, 2018. At hearing both parties were
represented by competent and professional counsel and cach had an opportunity to present evidence
and offer testimony. At the end of the proceedings, the record was closed, and both parties reserved
the right to file Post-Hearing submissions. On December 3, 2018 I received the Post-Hearing
submissions from both parties and mutually exchanged same via ¢-mail that same date. I received the

2
PBA’s reply on December 6, 2018, and the Borough’s reply on December 10, which were then mutually
exchanged via ¢-mail with the Parties. By letter dated December 11, 2018 the PBA objected to cenain
exhibits (municipal data related to the Borough’s comparables) submitted with the Borough's reply
submission. For the record, while typically relevant to the comparability analysis, these exhibits were

not particularly relevant in this proceeding due to the impact of the 2% hard cap.

This proceeding is governed by the Police and Fire Interest Arbitration Reform Act as set forth
in N.J.S.A.34:13A-16 through N.J.S.A.34:13A-16.9 as amended on June 24, 2014 by P.L. 2014, ¢.11
(the “Act”). The Act requires the use ofconventional arbitration and imposes strict limits on the amount
of base salary increases that can be awarded and on the awarding of new non-base salary economic
items. The Award must be in compliance with the appropriations and tax levy limitations in P.L. 1976,
c. 68 (C. 40A:4-45, ef. seq.) and Section 10 of P.L. 2007, c. 62 (C. 40A:4-45:45). The arbitrator is also
precluded from awarding a non-salary economic issue that was not included in the prior collective
negotiations agreement. This Interest Arbitration Award is issued in accordance with the 2% hard cap
limitation and the 16g interest arbitration criteria to the extent deemed relevant. See N.J.S.A. 34:13A-

16.7(b) and N.J.S.A, 34:13A-16g.

It is important to note that the partics have not agreed to the base salary calculation as of
December 31, 2017 that satisfies the requirement in N.J.S.A, 34:13A-16.7(b) of a baseline for the
aggregate amount expended by the Public Employer on base salary items for the twelve months
immediately preceding the expiration of the collective negotiations agreement that is subject to
arbitration. The 2% hard cap on base salary increases is calculated from the gross base salary payments

made to unit employees during the year of contract expiration.
Pursuant to P.L. 2014, ¢. 11, the arbitrator has 90 days from appointment, or by December 29,
2018, in which to render an award. This has resulted in a greatly compressed time period for issuance

of the award.
PARTIES FINAL OFFERS

Cc r tracts and N.

The PBA and Borough have an expired contract that had a duration of one year from January
1, 2017 through December 31, 2017. (Exhibit J-1). The prior contract was from January 1, 2013 through
December 31, 2016 (the “2013 CNA”). Pursuant to the 2013 CNA, PBA members were to progress
on cither a five or six step salary scale, depending on whether the employce was hired before or after
January 1, 2014 with a top-step in 2016 of $126,922. Regarding PBA members’ health insurance
contribution, the 2013 CNA provided that the Borough would be replacing the “Bollinger
Prescription Plan,” with one provided by the New Jersey State Health Benefits Plan ("SHBP") and
provided that beginning in 2016 the employees would contribute a flat 15% of the cost of their

healthcare premiums.
POSITION OF THE PARTIES
Th *s P Uy
The Borough’s primary issue in this proceeding is health insurance contributions. The Borough
argues that the only reasonable determination that can be made in this proceeding is to require PBA
members to contribute to the cost of their health insurance premiums at the rates set forth in Chapter
78 (“c.78"). The Borough also argues makes several arguments in support of its Final Offer. The

Borough's position is summarized below.

1. The PBA members healthcare contribution must be retumed to the levels set forth at N.J.S.A.
$2:14-17.28¢.

The Borough first argues that c. 78 contributions for PBA members were not fully implemented
in accordance with N.LS.A, 52:14-27.28d(c), and thus negotiations are preempted on this issuc. Only
after the statutorily mandated healthcare contributions of c. 78 were “fully implemented,” the Borough
argues were employers and employees freeto resume negotiations over this subject matter. NJS.A.

52:14-27.28¢.

The Borough submits that the Borough and the PBA agreed to the 2013 CNA that provided for c.
78 level contributions and dropped those contribution levels to a flat 15% in 2016. The Borough suggests
that the mandatory four-year phase-in period-during which bargaining is preempted-should have lasted

until at least July 1, 2017.

Consequently, the Borough maintains that the PBA must by law retum to their c. 78 contribution
level for at least another cighteen (18) months, as c. 78 makes clear that the obligation to complete the

four-year phase-in period survives even the sun-setting of the legislation. NLLS.A, 52:14-27.28¢. The
10
Borough argues that only then can the Parties re-enter negotiations on the issue of the PBA’s healthcare
contributions, with c. 78 levels representing the status quo at that time. Because the PBA members never
completed their statutorily-mandated four (4) years of contribution at c. 78 levels, the Borough argues
that the only “reasonable determination" that can be made on this issue is to return them to c. 78 levels so

that they can satisfy the obligation imposed upon them by the Legislature.

2. The Borough has implemented a pattern of settlement among its other bargaining units and non-
organized workforce that requires PBA members to retum to c.78 contribution levels.

The Borough's second point argues that all of its employees other than the PBA make c.78
contributions and it thus has pattern of settlement that requires PBA members to make c.78 contributions.
The Borough cites to PERC rules and regulations that speak to identifying “a pattern of salary and benefit
changes,” among an employer's bargaining units. NLA.C, 19:16-5.14(c) and PERC’s recognition of the

importance of maintaining a pattern of settlement among bargaining units of the same employer.

The Borough submits that it endeavors to foster a harmonious relationship with all labor units by
promoting continuity in the benefits offered employee-wide. This pattern, the Borough argucs, has been
accepted by all Borough employces other than the PBA members. The Borough submits that the
Borough's four (4) other bargaining units CNAs with the: (1) F.M.B.A.; (2) Telecommunicator’s Assoc.;
(3) DPW Employees Assoc.; and (4) R.W.D.S.U. uniformly provide that Borough employces maintain
c. 78 level contributions (Exhibits E- $ to E-8). TheBorough's non-union workforce, it submits, continue
to contribute at this same rate. The Borough thus argucs that it has implemented a pattem of settlement
with all bargaining units and employees wherein the c. 78 healthcare contribution levels are maintained.

The Borough argues that the evidence in the record leads to the conclusion that failure to adhere

to this pattern of settlement with relation to the PBA will serve to undermine the harmonious work
environment the Borough has worked so hard to cultivate, and which the pattern of settlement principle
is intended to promote. The Borough argucs that the PBA members are the highest compensated
bargaining unit in the Borough, with top step pay for patrol officers reaching $126,922 in base pay alone.
(Ex. J-1). The Borough submits that should the PBA be permitted to remain at 15% contributions, a
patrolman at top step making $126,922 would be contributing less than a Telecommunicator making
$71,222, who contributes 22-32% of the cost of his/her premium, depending on the type of coverage.
The Borough argues that this unjust result will sow discontent among the other bargaining units and non-
union workforce, thereby discouraging future settlements with those units, which runs directly counter

to PERC's policy considerations.

3. The Borough never agreed to reduce the PBA members healthcare contribution to 15% in
perpetuity.

The Borough maintains that nothing in Article VIII of the 2013 CNA grants the PBA lifetime
contributions at the 15% level. The Borough cites to Article VIII of the 2013 CNA that states that the
15% contribution level was to commence on January |, 2016 and was only to last “during this
Agreement.” The Borough argues that the plain language of the 2013 CNA dictates that the 15%
contribution level would only to last for the remainder of that contract, i.c., the calendar year 2016.

The Borough contends that the context of the Borough's negotiations with the PBA supports this
conclusion. Upon expiration of the 2013 CNA, the Borough and the PBA agreed to the 2017 CNA, which
maintained the 15% healthcare contribution for one year in consideration of the PBA members not taking
an annual salary increase (J-1). The Borough maintains that the record supports that the PBA member's

15% healthcare contribution was never intended to be permanent but was for a fixed one-year period
that was later extended for another year as set forth in the plain text of the 2013 CNA and the 2017

CNA.

4. The PBA’s demand that its healthcare contribution level remains at 15% is unprecedented in
comparison to similar departments.

The Borough argues that a comparison to other employces in similar municipalities supports the
Borough's position that the PBA must increase its healthcare contribution. Between the Borough and the
PBA, twenty-four (24) collective negotiations agreements conceming other police departments have
been admitted into evidence. The Borough submits that not a single department affords its members
healthcare contributions at a level of 15% of the cost or lower. A majority of the contracts in
evidence, according to the Borough, contain clauses mandating that employees continue making
contributions as per c. 78. These municipalities include: (1) Englewood (E-13); (2) Cliffside Park
(E-14); (3) Fort Lee (E-15); (4) Garfield (E-17), (5) Ridgewood (E-12); (6) Teaneck E-11); (7)
Wyckoff (E-9); (8) Paramus (E-10); (9) Edgewater (P-20); (10) New Milford (P- 21); (11) Midland
Park (P-23); (12) Wood-Ridge (P-28); and (13) Tenafly (P-25). The Borough submits that this group
includes the municipalities that the Borough argues are most comparable to Bergenfield in terms of size
and population, such as Englewood, Cliffside Park, Fort Lee, Paramus, and Ridgewood; as well as
neighboring municipalities Teaneck-which has a substantially larger population than Bergenfield-and
New Milford. The Borough points to Bergenfield's other neighbor, Dumont, that provides for healthcare

contributions of 30% of the cost of the premiums.
5. The terms of the PBA‘s Final Proposal are barred by New Jersey Law and would inure a
substantial hardship upon Borough citizens.

The Borough argues that the PBA's Final Offer seeks to receive more in base salary than in 2017,
but not give back anything of note-including a reasonable healthcare contribution. The Borough argues
that the financial effects of maintaining PBA members 15% healthcare contribution, step increases, and
longevity, while simultancously increasing base salaries by 1.8% would be devastating to Borough

taxpayers and is prohibited by law.

The Borough first argues that the 2% cap on base salary increases precludes the Arbitrator from
granting the PBA's proposal. The Borough submits that for purposes of calculating the 2% cap the starting
point is the total base salary cost in 2017 of $5,365,227.65 (E-2 at page 13, the “Scattergram™). The
Borough submits that under the 2% hard cap the total spend in 2018 is thus capped at $107,304.55. The
Borough submits that the Arbitrator’s award in this matter cannot increase base salary items by more than
$107,304.55 during the calendar year 2018. The Borough further submits that the increase in PBA
members’ salaries from step increases and longevity equates to $248,815.26 in 2018 which have been
paid. Thus, the Borough argues there is no money under the cap for a 1.8% annual increase and the

Arbitrator cannot grant such an increase as a matter of law.

The Borough also argues that the maintenance of the PBA members’ 15% healthcare contribution
will cost the Borough hundreds of thousands of dollars per year throughout the expected term of the next
contract. During calendar year 2018, the Borough submits that PBA members’ healthcare premiums cost
the Borough a total of $1,170,336.00; of which the PBA members contributed $175,241.01. (E-2). Under
the c. 78 levels the Borough secks, it argues the PBA contribution during 2018 would have been

$382,912.76. The Borough submits that were the Arbitrator to grant the PBA their requested level of

14
contribution, the Borough's taxpayers would be forced to cover that remaining $207,671.75 difference
in 2018 and $223,607.59 in 2019 in costs. (E-2, page 12).

The Borough argues that the PBA's proposed one-year contract with 15% healthcare contribution,
step movement, longevity increases, and 1.8% annual salary increase, will cost the Bergenfield taxpayers
$688,173.90 in calendar year 2018. This amount is comprised of ¢ $248,815.26 in step and longevity
increases; $112,280.86 in annual salary increase; and $207,671.75 in added health insurance costs
to the Borough as a result of the PBA's proposed 15% contribution level in comparison to c. 78

levels.

Based on those arguments and evidence, the Borough argues its Final Offer should be
awarded.

The PBA’s Position

The PBA argues that it relies upon the statutes, the rules and applicable case law in defending the
types of encroachments sought by the Borough in this proceeding.

The PBA argues that interest and welfare of the public is well served by the highly professional
and efficient members of the Bergenfield Police Department. They submit that the Bergenfield Police
Department is a full-service agency serving both a large residential population and a significant transient
population on a daily basis. The PBA argues that the “public” for this Police Department is not just the
twenty-six thousand seven hundred sixty-four (26,764) local residents but due to the Borough's
geography a significant transient population moving through the Borough throughout the day and

particularly during rush hours. The significance of this data they claim is that motor vehicle incidents,
safety demands, accidents, and gencral duty all spike during these periods when onc is serving the greater
population served by the Bergenfield Police Department.

The PBA also cites to the Police Chief's Annual Report for the year 2017. The PBA notes that the
Chief's Report stressed with pride that this is an accredited Police Department from the New Jersey
Association of Chiefs of Police and maintains services to the public of the highest quality. The PBA
further cites to the excellence in performance by the Bergenfield Police Department and its many
successes as echoed in the Council minutes. The PBA also notes that the cost of operations of the police
department have been reduced year-to-year. Citing the Police Chief's Annual Report, the PBA notes that

“the police administration stayed well within its budgetary allotment during 2017.”

The PBA submits that the Borough has not maintained staffing or career path opportunities
consistent with the increases in activity and demands for service. The PBA submits that at the beginning
of 2018 there were less swom Police Officers and supervisory positions on staff in the Bergenfield Police
Department than forty (40) years ago. The PBA argues that the reduction in supervisory positions alter
the career paths of a Bergenfield Police Officer affecting the ability to advance financially. The PBA
argues that now that the career path has been diminished a wage increase is the only way for Police
Officers to advance financially. Finally, the PBA argues that the cost of policing in Bergenfield has been
reduced because of the reduction in supervisory positions and that many of the senior patrol officers have
retired resulting in lesser paid step position police officers. The PBA argucs that virtually all the people
in the steps are young officers who have been brought into the position to replace senior officers at the
top of the wage/longevity guide who have retired. In sum, the PBA argues there is no question that the
public is well served by the exceptional level of professionalism and productivity as well as cost efficient

services provided by the Bergenfield Police Department.

16
The PBA argues that an analysis of the proofs submitted consistent with criteria N.J.S.A, 34:13A-
16, g (2) provides strong support for an award of the PBA’s Final Offer. The referenced statutory criteria
stresses comparisons and “conditions of employment of other employees performing the same or similar
services...”. The PBA submits that the proofs under this criterion illustrate support for an award of the

PBA Final Offer.

The PBA notes that there are three police contracts covering Bergenfield Police personnel; the
PBA, the Chief of Police and the Deputy Chief of Police. (P-7). The PBA submits that the Borough has
a clear and definitive pattern for contract resolution in the contracts with the Chief of Police and Deputy
Chief of Police. The PBA notes that both police contracts have a term through December 31, 2020
covering the same timeframe under consideration in this arbitration proceeding. The PBA further notes
that the terms set forth in the individual Articles of the Chief and Deputy Chief's contracts replicate the
same language in the PBA contract. The PBA also notes the fact that the contracts did not commence at
the same time but rather represent two separate yet near identical settlements on two separate dates in

different years.

The PBA argues that the two contracts guarantee the Chief and Deputy Chief with at least a two
percent (2%) wage increase for the term and guarantee the same fificen (15%) percent medical
contribution rates as the Borough challenges in this proceeding. The PBA notes that the Chief's contract
guarantees a pay differential in the form of a rank differential and the Deputy Chiefs contract guarantees
a minimum of two percent (2%) for 2018 “in addition to raises” for that year. It would appear therefore
that whatever increase is received by the rank-and-file will be enhanced by an additional two percent (2%)
for the Deputy Chief for 2018.
With respect to medical insurance premiums for the two contracts, the PBA argue they both show
a pattern of settlement of 15% health care contribution. In the Chief's contract there is a specific provision
that the “Chief of Police shall contribute to her health insurance cost in an amount equal to fifteen percent
(15%) of the total cost of health care benefits.” In the Deputy Chiefs contract, it provides that “The
Deputy Chief shall contribute to his health insurance cost in an amount equal to fifteen percent (15%) of
the total cost of health care benefits.” The PBA maintain that a pattern of settlements within the
Bergenfield Police Department with respect to wages and medical contribution is clearly well-established
by the Governing Body of the Borough of Bergenfield.

The PBA also argue that the Bergenfield Police Officer is not a highly paid officer using the
standard of Top Step Officer Base Pay but in fact is paid below average. They argue that the relative
position of the Bergenfield Police Officer is clearly below average among said Officer's peers based upon
the evidence presented by both parties in this proceeding. The PBA argues that even the clothing
allowance, a common form of reimbursement, and an issue in this proceeding comparisons show, again,

a level for the Bergenfield Officer which is below average of the parties” contracts.

The PBA notes that the average rate of increase for 2017 was 1.86% when the Bergenficld PBA
took a zero (0.0%). In 2018 and thereafter they argue that the average rates of increase exceed that which

is proposed by the PBA in this case.

With respect to the Chapter 78 premium contribution, the PBA notes that the change challenged
by the Borough occurred two contracts ago. In the most recent contract, covering the single calendar year
2017, the PBA notes it took a freeze on pay rates with no increases for the wage guide rates for a full year

just to continue the prior contract terms and to in part to offset the cost of step movement. The PBA
argues that a modification of Chapter 78 is in fact a trend which is growing in comparable municipalities
placed into evidence by the parties at hearing.

Based on the evidence in the record, the PBA argues its Final Offer must be awarded.
Di ION AND ANALYSI

A. The Arbitrator’s Authority

Public employers and public safety unions are statutorily mandated to resolve their labor disputes
pursuant to the Police and Fire Interest Arbitration Reform Act, N..S.A, 34:13A-16. By enacting the Act,
the Legislature recognized the unique and essential duties police officers and firefighters perform and the
life-threatening dangers they face. The purpose of the interest arbitration procedure is to promote the well-

being and benefit of New Jersey citizens as well as the high morale of employces and the efficient

operation of police and fire departments.

B. Statutory Criteria

In rendering an award, the Arbitrator must consider the following nine (9) factors:

2.

The interest and welfare of the public;

Comparison of wages, salaries, hours and conditions of employment of
the employces involved in the arbitration proceedings with wages, hours
and conditions of employment of other employees performing the same
or similar services and with other employces generally:

a. In private employment in general;

b. In public employment in general;

¢. In public employment in the same or similar comparable
jurisdictions as determined in accordance with sectionS of
P.L. 1995, ¢. 425 (C. 34:13A-16.2)

The overall compensation presently received by the employces inclusive
of direct wages, salary, vacations, holidays, excused leaves, insurance
and pensions, medical and hospitalization benefits, and all other
economic benefits received;

The stipulation of the parties;

The lawful authority of the employer;

20
6. The financial impact on the governing unit, its residents and taxpayers;

7. The cost of living;

8. The continuity and stability of employment, including seniority rights
and such other factors not confined to the foregoing which are ordinarily
or traditionally considered in the determination of wages, hours and
conditions of negotiations and collective bargaining between the parties
in the public service and in private employment.

9. Statutory restrictions imposed on the employer. Among the items the
arbitrator or panel of arbitrator shall assess when considering this factor

are the limitations imposed upon the employer by section 10 of P.L.
2007, c.62 (C. 40A:4-45.45).

The Arbitrator must render an award based on the evidence on the record in light of the statutory
criteria set forth above. The opinion and award must clearly address the criteria. It must include a
discussion of the evidence as it relates to the statutory criteria, the weight accorded to cach criterion and
the reason for the decision. The opinion and award must also explain whether any of the criteria were
deemed to be irrelevant and why.

This Award will be issued under concept of “conventional authority” pursuant to N.J.S.A. 34:13A-
16d; and, N.J.A.C. 19:16-5.7(¢). Under conventional authority, an arbitrator's award is not limited by
either party's final offer. Rather, the arbitrator has the power to select from cither party's last offer or,
alternatively, the arbitrator may use his or her judgment and grant an award that he or she feels is more

reasonable than any offers made by the parties. See, ¢.g.. H nt tor PBA |
232, Docket No. 1A-96-178 (July 28, 1997) (Arbitrator did not err by establishing third year salary for

Borough prosecutor investigators which was lower than the employer's offer).

N.J.S.A. 34:13A-16g(8) requires consideration of those factors ordinarily or traditionally

considered in the determination of wages, benefits, and employment conditions. One such consideration

21
is that the party proposing a change in an employment condition bears the burden of justifying the
proposed change. The burden must be met by sufficient evidentiary support. No proposed issue can be
deemed presumptively valid in the absence of justification that is supported by credible evidence.
Moreover, any decision to award or deny any individual issue in dispute, especially those having economic
impact, will include consideration as to the reasonableness of that individual issue in relation to the terms
of the entire award. A decision on an individual issue will include consider the reasonableness of awarding that issue
in relation to the overall terms of the award. Indeed, while there may be merit to awarding or denying a single issue if
it were to stand alone, a different conclusion is reached when considered within the context of the entire award. I am

also required by statute to determine the total net annual economic cost of the terms required by the award.

The parties have submitted documents and position statements addressing the statutory criteria
which I have reviewed and considered under the 16g criteria. The issues in dispute are both economic and
non-economic. Each issue in dispute will be addressed below and will include an analysis of the issue and

an award resolving that issue.

APPLICATION OF THE 162 CRITERIA

Public Interest Criteria 169 (1), (5), (6) & (9)

The Interest and Welfare of the Public, N.J.S.A. 34:13A-16g(1); The
Lawful Authority of the Employer, N.J.S.A. 34:13A-16g(5); The Financial
Impact on the Governing Unit, Its Residence, The Limitations Imposed
Upon the Local Unit’s Property Tax Levy, and Taxpayers, N.J.S.A.
34:13A-16g(6); and Other Restrictions Imposed on the Employer, N.J.S.A.

34:13A-16g(9).

The Public Interest Criteria is the most significant of all statutory factors to be considered and an
Arbitrator must give due weight to the interest and welfare of the public when issuing an award. It is a
criterion that includes the financial impact of the awarded increases and the desirability of maintaining
employce morale for the Borough's police officers. Indeed, the criteria recognizes the interest of the public
in knowing that its police department is staffed by competent, dedicated personnel possessing good
working morale, and the interest of the public in avoiding higher taxes and/or diminished services. As
Arbitrator Mastriani recognized in Point Pleasant_and PBA Local 106, IA-2012-001 (September 19,
2011): “The interest and welfare of the public is entitled to the most weight because it is a criterion that
embraces many other factors and recognizes their interrelationships, including the financial impact of an
award on the governing body and taxpayers.” See also Borough of Seaside Park and PBA Local 182, IA-
2012-022 (April 9, 2012) (“The interest and welfare of the public is not only a factor to be considered, it
is the factor to which the most weight must be given.”). “Arbitrators have reviewed the public interest as
encompassing the need for both fiscal responsibility and the compensation package required to maintain
an effective public safety department with high morale.” See Sayreville and PBA Local 98, IA 2006-047

(November 5, 2008).

23
The interest and welfare of the public criterion also specifically includes limitations that have been
imposed upon the employer by law. The statutory limitations are specifically referenced in other criteria
as well, including the lawful authority of the employer and the statutory restrictions upon the employer.
Since the enactment of the 2% hard cap, the statutory restrictions on the employer and lawful authority
are less relevant since the law requires the award be cap compliant. Here, neither party suggests that an
award will impact the lawful authority of the employer or the statutory restrictions upon the employer so

these criteria, while considered, are not relevant to this proceeding.
mparability 1

Comparison of the wages, salaries, hours, and conditions of employment
of the employees involved in the arbitration proceedings with the wages,
hours, and conditions of employment of other employces performing the
same or similar services and with other employees generally:

@ In private employment in general; provided, however, cach party
shall have the right to submit additional evidence for the arbitrator's
consideration.
© In public employment in general; provided, however, each party
shall have the right to submit additional evidence for the arbitrator's
consideration.

© In public employment in the same or similar comparable
jurisdictions, as determined in accordance with section 5 of C.34:13A-
16.; provided, however, that each party shall have the right to submit
additional evidence concerning the comparability of jurisdictions for
the arbitrator's consideration.

Internal Comparisons

Internal comparability can be broken down into two general categories consisting of uniformed
and non-uniformed employees within the same jurisdiction. An internal pattern of settlement in the same

jurisdiction involving both uniform and non-uniform employees is a significant factor in the determination
24
of an award because it usually corresponds to a public employer's budgetary capabilities and connotes

uniform treatment.

In this matter, the Borough submitted the following intemal comparables: Bergenfield Police
Department Telecommunicator’s Association (January 1, 2018 through December 31, 2012\E-5); Bergenfield
Employee's Association (January 1, 2015 to December 31, 2019\(E-6); Bergenfield Fireman's Association
F.M.B.A. Local No. 65 (January 1, 2014 through December 31, 2018\E-7); and Local 108, R.W.D.S.U.,
UFCW (January 1, 2017 to December 31, 2020) (E-8). The PBA submitted the Borough's contract with the
Chief of Police and Deputy Chief of Police (P-7) for its internal comparables.

External comparability consists of comparisons between the group subject to the petition and other
public safety employces in similar jurisdictions, other public employees, generally, and private sector
comparisons. In weighing salary statistics introduced by a party, | observe that PERC has promulgated

guidelines that may be broken down into the following five general categories:

1 Geographic comparability, contiguous jurisdiction or nearby, size
of jurisdiction, and nature of employing entity;

2 Socioeconomic considerations, basically a comparison of the type
of statistics found in the New Jersey Municipal Data Book and the

UCR, such as population density, cost of living, crime rate, violent
crime rate, fire incident and crime rate, etc.;

3 Financial considerations, such as the tax collection rate, state aid,
budget surplus, surplus history, ratios of tax revenue to total
revenue, ctc.;

4 Compensation/benefits provided to employees of the comparison
group; and

4 Any other comparability considerations deemed relevant by
the arbitrator.

25
Since 2011, comparability of percentage increases for interest arbitration is considered but has
been less relevant considering the 2% hard cap. Nevertheless, the Parties submitted the following
collective negotiations agreements as external comparables for consideration: Wyckoff (E-9); Paramus
(E-10); Teaneck (E-1 1); Ridgewood (E-12); Englewood (E-13); Cliffside Park (E-14); Fort Lee (E-15);
Lodi (E-16); Garfield (E-17), Saddle River (P-17); Cresskill (P-18); Englewood Cliffs (P-19); Edgewater
(P-20); New Milford (P-21, P-21A); Teaneck (P-22); Midland Park (P-23); Wood-Ridge SOA (P-24);
Wood-Ridge SOA MOA (P-24A); Tenafly (P-25); Paramus (P-26); Fort Lee (P-27),; Wood-Ridge (P-28);
East Rutherford (P-29); East Rutherford MOA (P-29A); and North Arlington (P-30). These extemal
comparables, while relevant, are given little weight considering the 2% hard cap and the limitations

imposed on the arbitrator under the Act.

According to the 2018 Biennial Report on the Police and Fire Interest Arbitration Reform Act
issued by PERC, the number of interest arbitration petitions decreased since the implementation of the
2% hard cap. After enactment of the law, there were twenty (20) petitions in 2015, nine (9) in 2016, and
twenty-nine (29) in 2017. The number of interest arbitration awards issued over the last two years
remained low (8 in 2016; 4 in 2017). For the years 2008 through 2017, the average annual salary increases
in interest arbitration awards were: 2008-3.73%; 2009-3.75%; 2010-2.88%; 201 1-2.05%; 2012-1.98%;

2013-1.89%; 2014- 1.69%; 2015-1.71%; 2016-1.94%; 2017-2.05%.
Privat r Wa:

Although an arbitrator must consider the general level of wage increases in the private sector, an
arbitrator is not required to accord such statistics any particular weight. Indeed, unless a party presents

credible evidence comparing a private sector classification to a public sector classification, the private
26
sector comparison will be considered but not given much weight. Here, neither party submitted evidence

on this criterion and it is afforded little weight.

On July 11, 2018, PERC published its most recent report of private sector wage changes based on
data compiled by the New Jersey Department of Labor and Workforce Development. For the fiscal year
period July 1, 2016 through June 30, 2017, according to PERC’s reporting, private sector wages increased
2.1%; government wages increased 1.9%; and total average annual wages increased 2.1%. Therefore, the
PERC study of private sector wage increases supports an award of a 2% or maximum cap salary increase

as proposed by both parties.
Overall Terms and Conditions of Employment 16213)

Overall compensation presently received by the employees, inclusive of
direct wages, salary, vacations, holidays, excused leaves, insurance and
pensions, medical and hospitalization benefits, and all other cconomic
benefits received.

The evidence considered by the Arbitrator encompasses the sfatus quo terms and conditions of
employment and note that that this unit receives: a top-step salary of $126,922.00, step increases based
on year of hire, Senior Officer Differential, longevity, overtime, compensatory time, uniform allowance,
holidays, health insurance with 15% contributions, life insurance, dental insurance, vacations, college

credit compensation, terminal leave, and sick leave, (J-1).
The Stipulation of the Parties, Nul.S.A, 34:13A-16e(4)

The Parties stipulations in this proceeding were procedural in nature and do not have any impact

on the substantive issues being considered nor on the impact of the Award.

27
Cost-of-living statistics can be obtained from a variety of sources. | note that the PBA introduced
a copy of a news release from the Bureau of Labor Statistics, U.S. Department of Labor dated September
13, 2018 (P-16) which noted that the CPI for the “New York - Newark - Jersey City” area over the year
increased by 2.2%. This is consistent with the same statistic for the national numbers where “All Items
Index rose 2.7%.” I note that these indices show increases in CPI greater than the 2% cap limited in this
proceeding and give it due weight accordingly.

ntinuity and Stability of Em N.J.S.A. 34:13A-1

N.J.S.A. 34:13A-16g(8) provides for consideration of:

The continuity and stability of employment including seniority rights and
such other factors not confined to the foregoing which are ordinarily or
traditionally considered in the determination of wages, hours, and
conditions of employment through collective bargaining between the
parties in the public service and in private employment.

The continuity and stability of employment criteria incorporates several concepts. The first
providing a competitive compensation and benefits package that alleviates excessive tumover thus
maintaining “continuity and stability in employment.” The second is the conceptof the “relative standing"
of a negotiations unit with respect to other units of similar employees. Last, the continuity and stability
of employment criteria incorporates the consideration of internal settlements and comparability, since

deviation from such settlements can undermine morale, discourage future settlements, and affect labor

relations stability.

28
ANALYSIS AND AWARD

The Final Offers and Award in this proceeding are analyzed and discussed below. The primary

issues for the Parties as articulated in their submissions are health insurance contributions and salaries.

Duration

The Borough has proposed a four-year term from January 1, 2018-December 31, 2021. 1 note the
prior agreement was for a one-year term (J-1) and the 2013 CNA was for a three-and-a-half-year term
(July 1, 2013-December 31, 2016)(E-3). 1 also note that the internal comparables submitted by the Parties
have the following terms: Bergenfield Police Department Telecommunicator’s Association (January 1, 2018
through December 31, 2021\E-5); Bergenfield Employee's Association (January 1, 2015 to December 31,
2019\(E-6); Bergenfield Fireman's Association F.M.B.A. Local No. 65 (January 1, 2014 through December
31, 2018 E-7); and Local 108, R.W.D.S.U., UFCW (January |, 2017 to December 31, 2020) (E-8); Chief of
Police (September 2015-December 31, 2020) and Deputy Chief of Police (June 21, 2016 to December 31,
2020) (P-7).

The PBA’s Final Offer is for a one-year term, January 1, 2018-December 31, 2018. The PBA
argues that a comparison of wages and terms and conditions of employment support its Final Offer on
duration, in part, “to avoid the harsh limitations of the so-called “Hard Cap Law.” The PBA also
submitted the Chief of Police contract and Deputy Chief of Police Contract (P-7). The PBA argued that
the Borough has a clear and definitive pattern for contract resolution in the contracts with the Chief of
Police and the Deputy Chief of Police. The PBA noted that both police contracts have a term through

December 31, 2020 covering the same timeframe under consideration in this arbitration proceeding. The

29
PBA also notes the fact that the contracts did not commence at the same time but rather represent two (2)

separate yet near identical settlements on two (2) separate dates in different years.

Contract duration has been addressed in Interest Arbitration proceedings on a consistent basis. In
City of Asbury Park, and PBA Local 6, 36 NJPER 4 126, it was noted that in deciding the issue of contract
duration, arbitrators must balance the nature of the employer's financial status, the need to provide
harmony and stability in the labor-management relationship, including the need to maintain the
department's increased effectiveness and productivity, and the desirability of maintaining the continuity
and stability of employment within the department.

Duration and the 2% cap were discussed in In the Matter of the Interest Arbitration
County of Hudson and Hudson County Sheriffs Officers PBA Local 334, Docket No. IA-2014-004
(December 30, 2013) wherein Arbitrator Osbom placed a heavy emphasis on the principles espoused in
Borough of Midland Park and Midland Park PBA Local 79, Docket No. 1A-2013-013 (2013), and
concluded:

There was not much doubt that a longer contract provides a period of labor peace and

stability which is beneficial to the parties and furthers the public interest ... However, both

in New Jersey and nationally, we are in a period of economic uncentainty. Indeed, it is

difficult to predict whether economic conditions will improve, deteriorate or remain stable.

. ». Because of the extreme impact of the hard cap on my ability to award a salary benefits

package which would more appropriately recognize the relevant statutory factors as set

forth immediately above, 1 reluctantly conclude that the parties and the public interest

would be better served if the parties were in a position to renegotiate the contract sooner

rather than later.

Arbitrator Osborn further noted that “A long-term freeze of members’ salary guide movement -
an almost inevitable outcome of applying the hard cap over the five-year contract - would be demoralizing
and would contribute to further attrition.”

An analysis of the evidence and arguments supports the reasonableness of both parties Final

Offers. For the Borough, a longer-term agreement provides for labor relations stability and some degree
of cost certainty for future budgeting and financial planning. For the PBA, a one-ycar deal allows them
to avoid the harsh limitations of the so-called “Hard Cap Law.”

On the issue of the duration of the agreement, I gave great weight to the following: (i) the Borough
agreements are all multi-year agreements; (ii) the prior one-year agreement between the parties
maintained health insurance at 15% and provided a zero (0%) wage increase (J-1); and (iii) the Chief and
Deputy Chief's contracts expire December 31, 2020. 1 further note that the PBA has stressed that the
Chief and Deputy Chiefs contract are the most comparable to the PBA and establish a pattern of

settlement.

The PBA’s argument that its term proposal is “to avoid the harsh limitations of the so-called 2%
Hard Cap law” does not alone justify an immediate retum to the bargaining table next week. This
argument was recently rejected by Arbitrator Mastriani, In The matter of Jersey City and Jersey City

Police Officers Benevolent Association (Docket No IA-2017-012), wherein he discussed pattern and

duration and found:

The City has established that there is a pattern of settlement on the issue of contract
duration. Insufficient credible evidence has been provided that would warrant a deviation from
the contract period that has been accepted by the City and all of its other public safety bargaining
units. The speculation that a two-year contract expiring on December 31, 2018 might provide a
more attractive legal environment for which the POBA could engage in negotiations with the
City docs not justify a deviation given the fact that all four public safety unions, including the
POBA, have had full opportunity to engage in negotiations under the existing law and reach
agreements that extend over a common time period.

That said, the implications of the 2% hard cap on any step movement or salary increase does not
warrant the PBA being financially handcuffed until end of 2021.

Based on the foregoing, | use my authority under conventional arbitration and deny the Borough Final Offer
and PBA Final Offer and award a three-year agreement from January |, 2018 to December 31, 2020. Awarding the

PBA proposal would force the parties immediately back to the negotiations table within days of this Award as the
31
Contract would be expiring. The Borough's four-year term and impact under the hard cap as discussed below would
be detrimental to PBA members and damage their morale, effectiveness and efficient performance of their mission. A
three-year term would not force the partics immediately back to the bargaining table and aligns with the expiration
of the Borough's agreement with Chief and Deputy Chief which the PBA expressed was the pattern of
settlement. | also note that the first year of the agreement under this award (2018) has passed. In 2018,
the step increase and longevity compensation have been paid and the 15% health care contributions were
continued. In the remaining two years of the contact awarded hereunder, the impact of the 2% hard cap
on step increases and longevity compensation (discussed below) and the Borough's desire to increase
medical insurance contributions to ch. 78 levels (discussed below) further supports the duration awarded
herein.

Article Ill, Salaries

The Borough’s Final Offer on Salaries is:
O% salary increase

No step increases. All bargaining unit members still in step remain at the same step on the
salary guide as they were on December 31, 2017for the duration of the contract.

Frozen Longevity payments during the term of the contract.

The PBA’s Final Offer is:
A 1.8% wage increase applied across-the-board to the salary schedules.

In calculating the statutory 2% hard cap, the arbitrator is dependent upon the parties to provide
the necessary information. In City of Atlantic City, P.E.R.C. No. 2013-82, PERC addressed the issue
of the parties” responsibilities to produce accurate employee information sufficient to enable the

arbitrator to make the calculations:

32
...the parties may not always agree on base salary information and calculations. In
those circumstances, the arbitrator must make a determination based on the
evidence presented. . .. We [direct] that all public employers in interest arbitration
to provide arbitrators with the required base salary information and calculations,
including... (1) a list of all unit employces, their base salary step in the last year of
the expired agreement, and their anniversary date of hire; (2) Cost of increments
and the specific date on which they are paid; (3) cost of any other base salary items
(longevity, educational costs, etc.) and the specific date on which they are paid; and
(4) the total cost of all base salary items for the last year of the expired agreement.

In that decision, PERC recommended that the arbitrator push the parties to submit the list before
the hearing and to reconcile any disputes at the beginning of the hearing. Here, the Parties have cach
separately provided a “list.” The Borough has provided the Scattergram prepared by Kent Christner,
Borough employee and CPA, that set forth the related data and employce information called for by the
statute. The Scattergram represents an analysis of the Borough’s salary expenditure for the calendar year
2017 for swom Bergenfield police officers. The information underlying the Scattergram was gencrated
from the Borough's payroll system, Automatic Data Processing (ADP). The Scattergram reflects that in
calendar year 2017 the Borough incurred a total base salary cost of $5,365,227.65. This number is
calculated by taking the total base salary cost of $5,742,448.65 and subtracting the Chief ($195,527.02)
and Deputy Chief ($181,693.98) who are not members of the bargaining unit. The PBA does not agree
with the calculations and presented its own table Chart No. 7 and Chart No. 8 as well as P-31, a payroll
report from ADP dated as of January 5, 2018. Chart No. 7 and P-31 submitted by the PBA reflects the
bargaining unit in 2018 and any longevity or senior officer differential in 2018. PBA Chart No. 8 sets
forth the composition of the bargaining unit by rank and provides salary, longevity and senior officer

differential for a total base salary calculation of $5,950,696.00.

N.J.S.A. 34:13A-16.7(a) and (b) defines the Base salary calculations for the initial calculation,

and subsequent years’ calculation of the cap:
33
“Base salary” means the salary provided pursuant to a salary guide or table
and any amount provided pursuant to a salary increment, including any
amount provided for longevity or length of service. It also shall include any
other item agreed to by the parties, or any other item that was included in
the base salary as understood by the parties in the prior contract. Base salary
shall not include non- salary economic issues, pension and health and
medical insurance costs.

“Non-salary economic issues” means any economic issue that is not
included in the definition of base salary.

b. An arbitrator shall not render any award pursuant to section 3 of
P.L.1977, c. 85 (C.34:13A-16) which, in the first year of the collective
Negotiation agreement awarded by the arbitrator, increases base salary
items by more than 2.0 percent of the aggregate amount expended by the
public employer on base salary items for the members of the affected
employee organization in the twelve months immediately preceding the
expiration of the collective negotiation agreement subject to arbitration. In
each subsequent year of the agreement awarded by the arbitrator, base
salary items shall not be increased by more than 2.0 percent of the aggregate
amount expended by the public employer on base salary items for the
members of the affected employee organization in the immediately
preceding year of the agreement awarded by the arbitrator.

The parties may agree, or the arbitrator may decide, to distribute the
aggregate monetary value of the award over the term of the collective
negotiation agreement in unequal annual percentage increases, which shall
not be greater than the compounded value of a 2.0 percent increase per year
over the corresponding length of the collective negotiation agreement. An
award of an arbitrator shall not include base salary items and non-salary
economic issues which were not included in the prior collective
negotiations agreement.

The methodology for the calculation of the 2% hard cap was set forth In f New Milford,
2012-53, 38 NJPER 340 (4116 2012), where PERC adopted guiding principles conceming the

arbitrator's responsibility in applying the 2% hard cap:

... we must determine whether the arbitrator established that the award will

not increase base salary by more than 2% per contract year or 6% in the

aggregate for a threc-ycar contract award. In order for us to make that

determination, the arbitrator must state what the total base salary was for

the last year of the expired contract and show the methodology as to how
34
base salary was calculated. We understand that the parties may dispute the
actual base salary amount and the arbitrator must make the determination
and explain what was included based on the evidence submitted by the
parties.

Next, the arbitrator must calculate the costs of the award to establish that
the award will not increase the employer's base salary costs in excess of 6%
in the aggregate. The statutory definition of base salary includes the costs
of the salary increments of unit members as they move through the steps of
the salary guide. Accordingly, the arbitrator must review the of the
employees’ placement on the guide to determine the incremental costs in
addition to the across-the-board raises awarded. The arbitrator must then
determine the costs of any other economic benefit to the employees that
was included in base salary, but at a minimum this calculation must include
a determination of the employer's cost of longevity. Once these calculations
are made, the arbitrator must make a final calculation that the total
economic award does not increase the employer's costs for base salary by
more than 2% per contract year, or 6% in the aggregate...

Since an arbitrator, under the new law, is required to project costs for
the entirety of the duration of the award, calculation of purported savings
resulting from anticipated retirements, and for that matter, added costs
due to replacement by hiring new staff or promoting existing staff are
all too speculative to be calculated at the time of the award. The
Commission believes that the better model to achieve compliance with
P.L. 2010 ¢. 105 is to utilize the scattergram demonstrating the
placement on the guide of all of the employces in the bargaining unit as
of the end of the year preceding the initiation of the new contract, and
to simply move those employees forward through the newly awarded
salary scales and longevity entitlements. Thus, both reductions in costs
resulting from retirements or otherwise, as well as any increases in costs
stemming from promotions or additional new hires would not affect the
costing out of the award required by the new amendments to the Interest
Arbitration Reform Act.

With regard to the first component of the calculation, the objective is to determine how much the
employer actually paid unit employees for all components of base pay in the last year of the expired
agreement. The arbitrator's responsibility to pro-rate pay for new hires and mid- year terminations during
the base year was confirmed by PERC in Borough of Byram, P.E.R.C. No. 2013-72, (4/18/13). Once the

35
total base pay paid in the base year is determined, then the 2% is calculated. This is the maximum amount
that can be awarded in the first year of the new agreement. It must include amounts the employer will

expend (or in some cases, has already paid out) for step increases and longevity increases.

The 2% hard salary cap sets a strict limit on the amount of base salary that can be awarded, and
the Borough and PBA recognize this is what is required in this interest arbitration proceeding. The legal
framework, and PERC's interpretation and application of the statute as to the methodology for calculating
wage increases has been set forth in Borough of New Milford, P.E.R.C. No. 2012-53, 38 NJPER 340
(7.116 2012) and Borough of Ramsey, P.E.R.C. No. 2012-60, 39 NJPER 17 (43 2012) and their progeny.
A summary of arbitral authority cited in those decisions was recently set forth in State of New Jersey and

FOP Lodge 91, P.E.R.C. NO. 2016-11 (2016).

The Borough claims it has adhered to PERC's strict mandates in both calculating the “jumping
off point for the 2% calculation, as well as projecting the costs of step movement and longevity increases
throughout the proposed contract period. In this matter, the Borough maintains that the Scattergram sets
forth the actual base salary paid to all swom law enforcement officers for the calendar year 2017 as
$5,365,227.65, which is derived by deducting the salaries of the Chief and Deputy Chief—who are not
members of the PBA—from the total listed on Scattergram. Accordingly, the Borough argues that the
total base salary in 2017 was $5,365,227.65, and 2% of this number equates to $107,304.55.

The Borough submits that the actual cost to the Borough of step and longevity increases for the
PBA members in 2018 cost the Borough $248,815.26 and have been paid. Thus, the Borough argues that
the total base salary increases for PBA members in 2018 from step and longevity contractual increases
equates to a 4.6% increase, and therefore the arbitrator cannot grant the PBA's proposed 1.8% salary
increase on top of step and longevity movement.

36
The Borough notes that its submission at the hearing (E-2 pages 2-10) included costs and/or cost
savings from retirements and/or promotions that should not be included in the 2% calculation per New
Milford. The Borough maintains that inclusion of such information leads to a more accurate understanding
of the financial cost of the proposed contract and thus included such information in E-2 for illustrative
purposes. The Borough instead relies upon the Scattergram and the financial models in Christner
Certification Exhibits A-D which do not account for retirements/promotions subsequent to December 31,
2017 as per New Milford.

The Borough submits that the PBA’s calculations are flawed. The Borough submits that the PBA’s
submission purports to identify the step/longevity movement for its members in 2018 but suggests the
figures are inaccurate. The Borough argues that PBA Chart No. 7 is not for December 31, 2017 as it has
PBA members at their 2018 positions/salaries. The Borough also notes that Chart No. 8 overstates the
number of Licutenants and Sergeants on the payroll as of December 31, 2017, and by extension overstates
the amount of that salary cost in Chart No. 8 submitted by the PBA.

The PBA argues that the Borough has not maintained staffing or carecr path opportunities
consistent with the increases in activity and demands for service. The PBA argues that the reduction in
supervisory positions alter the career paths of a Bergenfield Police Officer and the only way to advance

financially is through wage increases.

The PBA argues that the Borough's analysis of employee costs is flawed. The PBA argued the
Borough incorrectly performed a net cost comparison from 2017 to 2018. The PBA also argued that to
assess 2018 costs, the Borough mistakenly used the reciprocal of promotions made during the year 2017
which were paid for only part of the year. The PBA argues the same is true with respect to longevity and
senior officer differential. The PBA argues that the correct methodology is to establish that rate being

paid at the end of December 31, 2017 and annualize it. That annualized value is the basis for computation
37
going forward says the PBA. The PBA submits that the methodology used by the PBA in its presentation

is the proper interpretation and methodology consistent with the statute.

The evidence submitted by the parties on this criterion supports a Final Offer of an award at the
maximum amount allowable by law. The cost of living data and wage increases generally in the public
sector (1.9%) and in the private sector (2.1%) data support such an award. The other criteria have been
considered and do not yicld a different result. The overall compensation and benefits criterion reflect that
unit employees are reasonably compensated and have a 15% health care contribution. The record reflects
that a top step officer in 2016 could carn as much as $126,922.00. In addition, there are benefits including,
but not limited to, step increases, longevity, senior officer differential, overtime, compensatory time, off
duty work, uniform allowance, vacations, holidays, health insurance with a 15% contribution, life

insurance, dental insurance, college credit compensation, and terminal leave.

The continuity and stability of employment criterion supports the maximum allowable award
under the 2% hard cap. As previously indicated, the record reflects that the terms of the award will not
compel the Borough to exceed the statutory limitation on it such as the tax levy cap or the spending
appropriation cap, or that the amount of moncy equaling the cap would have adverse financial impact on
the Borough.

The Scattergram and Christner Certification Exhibits A-D provide as follows: (1) the gross base
salary of amount as of December 31, 2017 is $5,365,227.65; (2) in 2018, the step increases and
longevity compensation ($248,815.26) increased base salary to $5,614,042.91; in 2019, the step increases
and longevity compensation ($189,024.48) is projected to increase base salary to $5,803,067.39; in 2020,

the step increases and longevity compensation ($189,851.00) is projected to increase base salary to

38
$5,992,918.39; and in 2021, the step increases and longevity compensation ($206,874.75) is projected to
increase base salary to $6,199,793.14. Certification of Kent Christner, Exhibits A-D. The PBA’s
submission Chart No. 7, Chart No. 8 and P-31 is based on 2018 data and does not comport with

scattergram called for in City of Atlantic City.

After analysis of the record, | accept the Borough's Scattergram with a “Base salary” as of
December 31, 2017 of $5,365,227.65 as the baseline for calculating the 2% hard cap. Applying the 2%
formula equates to a permissible salary expense of $107,304.55 in 2018. In 2018, the step increases have
been paid in the amount of $248,815.26. These increases are within the definition of base salary increases
and are chargeable to the salary cap exceeding the cap by $141,510.71 in 2018. In 2019, the step increases
and longevity compensation amount to $189,024.48 and exceed the permissible spend of $109,450.64 by
$79,573.84. These increases are within the definition of base salary increases and are chargeable to the
salary cap leaving no additional money to apply under the cap in 2019. In 2020, the step and longevity
compensation amount to $189,851.00 and exceed the permissible spend of $111,639.65 by $78,211.35
leaving no additional money to apply under the cap in 2020. In 2021, the step and longevity compensation
amount to $206,874.00 and exceed the permissible spend of $113,672.00 by $93,202.00 leaving no

additional moncy to apply under the cap in 2021.

Based on the Scattergram, the total cost of step movements and longevity compensation over the
proposed four-year agreement is $834,564.74. Based on the Scattergram, the total permissible spend over
the term of the Borough's proposed four-year term is $442,267.29 and under the PBA’s one-year term
has been exceeded. Over the three-year term awarded herein the total permissible spend is $328,394.84.

In 2018, the first-year under this Award, the step increases and longevity compensation in the amount of

39
$248,815.26 have been paid leaving $79,579.58 permissible compensation to be awarded for 2019 and
2020.

As recognized by the PBA, “virtually all of the people in the steps presently are young officers
who have been brought in to the position to replace more senior officers at the top of the wage/longevity
guide who have retired.” The PBA also recognizes “the harsh limitations of the so-called “Hard Cap
Law™ and the prior one-year contract was to “offset the cost of step movement.” The PBA understands
the impact of the hard cap on the guide and in the prior agreement bargained for a one-year contract with

0% increase and for continued healthcare at the 15% contribution. They argued for the same result here.

The application of the 2% hard cap formula over a three-year term supports the following Award:
2018-0% salary increase, full step increases, senior officer differential and longevity compensation
(which have been paid); 2019-0% salary increase, step increases October 1, 2019 ($44,751.83), senior
officer differential and longevity compensation in accordance with the Agreement in the amount of
$10,017.35, 2020-0% salary increase, no step increases, senior officer differential and longevity increases

in accordance with the Agreement in the amount of $13,888.75.

The Borough's Final Offer of 0% salary increase, no step increases (frozen steps) and frozen
longevity compensation during the term of the agreement is not fully supported by the record and is not
awarded. In 2018, the first year under this Award, step movement and longevity compensation has been
paid which exceeded the 2% cap. Such compensation would not be permitted to be awarded by an
arbitrator under the Act and would force an evaluation of those payments. By extending the term, the
2018 step payments and longevity compensation can be spread out over 2019 and 2020. The Award of

delayed step increase and longevity compensation in 2019 and longevity compensation in 2020 is

40
permissible under the cap and offsets the impact of the cap on the inability to award any salary increase
or full step guide movement. The PBA’s Final Offer of 1.8% salary increase applied across-the board to
the salary guide, however, exceeds the 2% hard cap limitations. Based on a baseline base salary figure of
$5,365,227.65 in 2017, the 2% cap would allow for a spend of $107,304.55 in 2018. Step increases and
longevity compensation in 2018 total $248,815.26 exceeding the cap by $141,510.71. Besides the step
and longevity increases, the PBA‘s Final Offer in 2018 of 1.8% ($96,574.09) exceeds the 2% cap

limitation. Due to the 2% hard cap, the PBA‘s salary proposal is denied.

Accordingly, the Award on salary shall be:

2018 0% salary increase, full step increases, longevity and senior officer differential.

2019 0% salary increase, step increases October |, 2019, longevity compensation and senior
officer differential in accordance with the terms of the Agreement.

2020 0% salary increase, no step movement, longevity and senior officer differential in
accordance with the terms of the Agreement.

The salary amounts awarded represent the maximum salary increases that can be awarded under
the cap on base salary increases with discretion limited to the distribution of those amounts.
Health Insurance Contributions
Article VIII, Insurance and Dental Benefits provides as follows:
Section 1.
Existing B-Med Blue Cross, Blue Shield and Dental Insurance benefits shall be

continued for ail active employees and employees who are retired and their
eligible dependents during the term of this Agreement.

4l
Section 2.

The Borough agrees to pay the sum of $10,000 to the estate of any employee killed
in the line of duty.

Section 3.

The Borough shall provide as an additional medical coverage at the Borough's sole
cost and expense, a full family prescription drug insurance plan for all
employees covered by this Agreement. Said prescription program shall have a
five-dollar ($5.00) co-payment on generic prescriptions, ten-dollar ($10.00) — co-
payment on name-brand prescriptions and zero ($0.00) co-payment on mail
order prescriptions.

Section 4.

Should the Employer seek to change insurance carriers or if. for any reason,
insurance change to any degree then the Employer shall be required to give
not less than ninety (90) day notice, whenever possible, to the P.B.A. of any
informed change. Such ninety (90) day notice shall include at the time of notice a
copy of the proposed changed provisions or policy.

Section 5.

Each active employee shall contribute Two Hundred Sixty ($260.00) Dollars per
year toward medical benefits. Said contribution shall be made on a ten dollar
($10.00) per biweekly paycheck basis, until Section 6 takes effect.

Section 6.

Effective July 1, 2013, employees covered by this contract shall pay the statutorily
mandated percentage of their health benefits pursuant to Chapter 78. Effective
January 1, 2016 and during this Agreement employees covered by this
Agreement shall pay fiftcen (15%) of the total cost of their health care benefits.
All such payment referenced herein are to be made by way of payroll deductions.

In the event that Chapter 78 is deemed unlawful or repealed, then employees shall
revert to their prior obligations.

The Borough's Final Offer proposes the following on the Health Care Contribution:

Heath Insurance Contribution- 15% of the cost of premiums. This contribution level
is contingent upon agreement to the terms |-4 above. In the event that an agreement
cannot be reached as to items 1-4 above, the Borough maintains that the bargaining
unit members must contribute at the levels set forth in N.J.S.A. $2:14-17.28¢.

42
Notwithstanding its Final Offer of 15% of the cost of premiums as a health care contribution
conditioned on the wage and longevity issue, the Borough first suggests that c.78 contributions for PBA
members were not fully implemented in accordance with N.J.S.A, 52:14-27.28d(c), and thus negotiations

are preempted on this issue.

The Borough submits that the Borough and the PBA agreed to the 2013 CNA that provided for c.
78 level contributions but dropped those contribution levels to a flat 15% in calendar year 2016. The
Borough maintains that the PBA must by law retum to their c. 78 contribution levels as PBA members
never completed their statutorily mandated four (4) years of contribution at c. 78 levels. The Borough’s
second point argues that all its employees other than the PBA make c.78 contributions and it thus has
pattern of settlement that requires PBA members to make c.78 contributions. The Borough cites to PERC
rules and regulations that speak to identifying "a pattern of salary and benefit changes,” among an
employer's bargaining units. NAC, 19:16-5.14(c) and PERC’s recognition of the importance of
maintaining a pattern of settlement among bargaining units of the same employer. This pattern, the
Borough argues, has been accepted by all Borough employees other than the PBA members. The
Borough submits that the Borough's four (4) other bargaining units CNAs with the: (1) F.M.B.A.; (2)
Telecommunicator’s Assoc.; (3) DPW Employees Assoc.; and (4) R.W.D.S.U. uniformly provide
that Borough employees maintain the same level of contribution as they had during the c. 78
period. E- 5 to E-8. TheBorough's non-union workforce, it submits, continue to contribute at this
same rate. The Borough thus argues that it has implemented a pattem of settlement with all

bargaining units and employces wherein the c. 78 healthcare contribution levels are maintained.

43
The Borough argues that the evidence in the record leads to the conclusion that failure to
adhere to this pattern of settlement with the PBA will serve to undermine the harmonious work
environment the Borough has worked so hard to cultivate, and which the pattern of settlement
principle is intended to promote. The Borough argues that the PBA members are the highest
compensated bargaining unit in the Borough, with top step pay for patrol officers reaching $126,922
in base pay alone. (J-1). The Borough submits that should the PBA be permitted to remain at 15%
contributions, a patrolman at top step making $126,922 would be contributing less than a
Telecommunicator making $71,222, who contributes 22-32% of the cost of his/her premium,
depending on the type of coverage. NLLS.A. 52:14-27.28c. The Borough argues that this unjust result
will sow discontent among the other bargaining units and non-union workforce, thereby discouraging
future settlements with those units, which runs directly counter to PERC’s policy considerations.
Fox. vy, Morris Cty, 266 NJ. Super, 501, 519 (App. Div. 1993), certif. denied, 137 NJ. 311
(1994).

The Borough maintains that nothing in Article VIII of the 2013 CNA grants the PBA lifetime
contributions at the 15% level. The Borough cites to Article VIII of the 2013 CNA explicitly that states
that the 15% contribution level was to commence on January |, 2016 and was only to last “during this
Agreement.” The Borough argues that the plain language of the 2013 CNA dictates that the 15%
contribution level would only to last for the remainder of that contract, i.c., the calendar year 2016. The
Borough maintains that the record supports that the PBA member's 15% healthcare contribution was
never intended to be permanent but was for a fixed one-year period that was later extended for

another ycar as set forth in the plain text of the 2013 CNA and the 2017 CNA. (J-1 & E-3).
The Borough also argues that a comparison to other employces in similar municipalities supports
the Borough's position that the PBA must increase its healthcare contribution. The Borough submits that
based on the external comparables in the record not a single department affords its members healthcare
contributions at a level of 15% of the cost or lower. The vast majority of the contracts in evidence,
according to the Borough, contain clauses mandating that employces continue making contributions as
per c. 78. These municipalities include: (1) Englewood (E-13); (2) Cliffside Park (E-14); (3) Fort Lee
(E-15); (4) Garfield (E-17); (5) Ridgewood (E-12); (6) Teaneck (E-11); (7) Wyckoff (E-9); (8) Paramus
(E-10); (9) Edgewater (P-20); (10) New Milford (P- 21); (11) Midland Park (P-23); (12) Wood-Ridge
(P-28); and (13) Tenafly ( P-25). This group includes the municipalities that the Borough argues are
most comparable to Bergenfield in terms of size and population, such as Englewood, Cliffside Park, Fort
Lee, Paramus, and Ridgewood; as well! as neighboring municipalities Teaneck-which has a substantially
larger population than Bergenfield-and New Milford. The Borough points to Bergenfield’s other neighbor,

Dumont, that provides for healthcare contributions of 30% of the cost of the premiums.

The PBA argues that interest and welfare of the public is well served by the exceptional level of
professionalism and productivity as well as cost efficient services provided by the Bergenfield Police
Department. The PBA argues that an analysis of the proofs submitted consistent with criteria N.J.S.A.
34:13A-16, g(2) provides strong support for an award of the PBA’s Final Offer. The PBA cites to the Chief
of Police and the Deputy Chief of Police contracts and submits that the Borough has a clear and definitive
pattern for contract resolution. The PBA argues that the two contracts guarantee those Police Officers the
same medical contribution of fifteen percent (15%). In the Chief’s contract there is a specific provision
that the “Chief of Police shall contribute to her health insurance cost in an amount cqual to fifteen percent
(15%) of the total cost of health care benefits.” The PBA notes that the Deputy Chiefs contract provides

that “The Deputy Chief shall contribute to his health insurance cost in an amount equal to fifteen percent
45
(15%) of the total cost of health care benefits.” The PBA submits that the Governing Body has established
a continuation in a multi-year contract of the fifteen percent (15%) medical contribution provision. The
PBA argues that the pattern of settlements within the Bergenfield Police Department with respect to wages
and medical contribution is clearly well-established by the Governing Body of the Borough of
Bergenfield.

The PBA argues that the Borough negotiated modifications of Chapter 78 premium contributions
two contracts ago. In the most recent contract, covering the single calendar year 2017, the PBA notes it
took a freeze on pay rates with no increases for a full year just to continue the prior contract terms and in
part to offset the cost of step movement. The PBA submits that the modification of ch. 78 contributions

is a trend which is growing in comparable municipalities placed into evidence by the parties at hearing.

Regarding the ch. 78 contribution issue, it is important to note that the 2013 negotiated CNA
provided for a reduction from ch. 78 contribution levels to 15% of the cost of premiums. The 2017 CNA
continued the contribution levels at 15%. In the context of these proceedings, as noted above, the Borough
has offered 15% of the cost of premiums as a health care contribution. To the extent the Borough suggests
the issue is preempted from consideration, I note that N.J.A.C. 19:16-5.5 provides for expedited scope of
negotiations determinations in interest arbitration proceedings and the failure to file a request for a scope
determination “shall be deemed a waiver of the negotiability objection.” N.J.A.C. 19:16-5.5(c). I therefore
will not address the ch.78 contribution issue other than in the context of the Borough's Final Offer to
return to ch. 78 levels with respect to the term, wage and longevity issues in this proceeding discussed
above.

Based on the evidence and submissions of the Parties, I find that the application of the 16g criteria
support an award of the Borough's Final Offer of Fifteen (15%) percent of the cost of premiums as the

46
health care contribution. While the Borough argued ch.78 and the return to ch.78 contribution levels, its
Final Offer was 15% of the cost of premiums conditioned upon the term, wages and longevity. The impact
of the 2% hard cap on my ability to award a salary and health benefits package which would more
appropriately recognize and analyze the relevant statutory factors supports the award of the continuation

of the 15% of premium cost health care contribution sought by the Borough.

The interest and welfare of the public supports the continuation of the 15% of premium health
care contribution. While it may cost the Borough more than ch.78 levels, continuing the 15% of premium
health care contribution will help offset the impact of the 2% hard cap on the PBA members inability to
see any meaningful increase in salary or longevity in 2019 and 2020. The comparability with the Chief
and Deputy Chief contracts that provide for the 15% of premium health care contribution is also given
great weight in awarding the Borough's Final Offer. The overall compensation supports the award as the
fiscal limitations imposed by the 2% hard cap and its impact on this bargaining unit cannot be ignored.
The lawful authority, financial impact on the governing unit, its residents and taxpayers, and statutory
restrictions on the employer are not impacted due to the 2% hard cap. The continuity and stability of
employment also supports an award of the Borough's Final Offer of 15% of premium health care
contribution to offset the impact on salaries under the 2% hard cap formula. As noted by Arbitrator Osbom
in Hudson County citing Midland Park. “A long-term freeze of members’ salary guide movement - an
almost inevitable outcome of applying the hard cap over the five-year contract - would be demoralizing
and would contribute to further attrition.” In that vein, I note that the term of three-years awarded herein
lessens the impact of a freeze of members’ salary guide movement and allows the Borough the opportunity

to return to the bargaining table in 2020 and seek a return to ch. 78 contribution levels.

47
Based on the 16g criteria and record, | award the Borough's Final Offer of 15% of premium health

care contribution.
The other proposals in the Parties’ Final Offers are addressed below.

Article IV, Longevity.

The Parties Agreement in Article IV provides for Longevity compensation based on years of
service. The longevity compensation begins in the sixth year of employment with 1% of base pay to
twenty-four years or more years of service at 8% of base pay.

The Borough's Final Offer seeks:

No longevity payments during the term of the contract.

At the hearing, the Borough clarified that longevity payments would be frozen during the term of
the agreement. The PBA notes that longevity compensation has been paid in 2018 and objects to any

freezing or other reduction in this benefit.

The burden is on the Borough to prove the need for the requested freeze on longevity. I have
analyzed this component of the Borough's Fina! Offer in the Salary discussion above. | therefore do

not award the Borough's Final Offer.
Accumulated Time
The Borough’s Final Offer seeks:

All accumulated time paid out each time there is a promotion or, if at top of the
salary guide, each time there is a pay increase.

The PBA submits that this proposal would create an administrative nightmare and build in a

cost which is incalculable and unreasonable. The burden is on the Borough to prove the need for the

48
requested change in the Agreement. The Borough has not submitted evidence enough to mect its
burden with respect to the requested change. I therefore do not award this proposal.

Articte 111, Salaries.
Article III, section 4 of the Agreement provides:

Transfers-Patrolman with N.J. Certificate transferring to Bergenfield will be paid as follows:
First Year- Receive 1“ year Patrolman pay scale (until off probation).

Second Year- With five years of experience, receives 3™ year of pay scale

Third Year- With ten years of experience, receives 4" year pay scale

The Borough’s Final Offer seeks:

Lateral Hires. Reword Article Ill, section 4 about lateral hires to reference “police
experience” and prior anniversary dates.
The PBA submits that this proposal would require additional information and replacement

language which was not provided. The PBA also notes the proposal is hypothetical at best.

The burden is on the Borough to prove the need for the requested change in the Agreement.
The Borough has not submitted evidence sufficient to meet its burden with respect to the requested

change. I therefore do not award this proposal.
Article 1X, Vacations.

Sections 2 and 3 of Article 1X Vacations of the Parties Agreement provides:

Section 2

Where, in any calendar year, the vacation, or any part thereof, is not granted by
reason of pressure of municipal business, it shall accumulate and be granted in
the next succeeding calendar year only. Vacation time accrued but not taken

49
voluntarily shall not accumulate beyond the calendar year in which it
occurs.

Section 3

An employee who is entitled to receive a vacation increase during a calendar year
shall be entitled to access to that higher level of vacation at any time during
the calendar year.

The Borough's Final Offer requests:

Article 1X Section 2 Reworded to state that any carry over vacation must be taken
by 3/31 of the following year at the Chiefs discretion.

Anticle 1X, Section 3, increased vacation because of service time will be prorated in the
first year cared based on date of accrual.

The PBA submits that the change to section 2 would create an administrative nightmare in that
entitlements occurring late in the year would be available in a tight timeframe likely exposing the
Borough to overtime. As to changes to section 3, they argue this proposal was neither explained nor

supported by any evidence.

The burden is on the Borough to prove the need for the requested change in the Agreement.
The Borough has not submitted evidence sufficient to meet its burden with respect to the requested

change. I therefore do not award this proposal.
Article X1, Miscellaneous.

Article XI, Miscellaneous provides:

All employees attending training seminars shall receive a daily expense allowance
inthe amount of Three ($3.000 Dollars.

The PBA argues that the elimination of this benefit requires some sort of evidentiary showing.
They further submit that there is no indication in any of the proofs as to what this may cost the Borough,
how often it is used, or whether it has been used in the last six (6) years.
50
The burden is on the Borough to prove the need for the requested change in the Agreement.
The Borough has not submitted evidence enough to mect its burden with respect to the requested

change. I therefore do not award this proposal.
Article XIV, Sick Leave
Article XIV, Sick Leave provides for sick leave based on “continuous service”.

The Borough secks to add “to the Borough” to all references of years of service in Article XIV.
The PBA submits that this uses the new standard of “to the Borough” for benefit allocation. They argue
that this is directly opposite to Proposal #7 in reference to new hires. They submit that someone with
four (4) years of military experience prior to coming to the Borough and using that experience as part
of the application process would be affected. The PBA maintains that the Borough would be benefited
by that prior experience. Those employees who had prior military experience are now advanced using
the Pension standard for benefit allocation (creditable pension service under the New Jersey Police and

Fire Pension Fund) and would all be reduced in benefits.

The burden is on the Borough to prove the need for the requested change in the Agreement.
The Borough has not submitted evidence sufficient to meet its burden with respect to the requested

change. I therefore do not award this proposal.
Article XIV, Sick Leave
Article XIV, Sick Leave, section | provides:
Lateral transfers receiving first year salary will be credited with 15 additional sick days.

Lateral transfers receiving second year salary will be credited with 30 sick days.

31
The Borough's Final Offer seeks to “Eliminate 15 additional sick days for lateral transfers in

Article XIV.”

The PBA’s response to this proposal is “nothing but a taking from people who are starting new
employment. Why an employer would want to reduce an attractive benefit to a new Employee remains

a mystery.”

The burden is on the Borough to prove the need for the requested change in the Agreement.
The Borough has not submitted evidence sufficient to meet its burden with respect to the requested

change in the Agreement. | therefore do not award this proposal.
Section 3 of Article XIV, Sick Leave, provides:

Employees who have four (4) or more years of credited Pension Time (PFRS) shall
be considered to have four (4) years of Bergenfield Police Service as required
in Section 1.

The Borough secks to eliminate this section. The PBA objects to this proposal noting that it “is
just another unwarranted taking without any evidentiary showing whatsoever.”

The burden is on the Borough to prove the need for the requested change in the Agreement.
The Borough has not submitted evidence enough to mect its burden with respect to the requested

change. I therefore do not award this proposal.
Appendix A-1
Appendix A-1 of the Parties Agreement is a Salary Guide that provides:

*Those employees will also receive a voucher system from the Borough
for Academy and Town Uniforms and Equipment per agreed list.
The Borough proposes that “per agreed list” language be eliminated from Appendix A-1 and add
“per Agency policy and Academy requirements.” The PBA submits that the Borough's proposal and

reasoning expressed at the hearing is confusing as the Agency policy says the contract is controlling.

The burden is on the Borough to prove the need for the requested change in the Agreement.
The Borough has not submitted evidence sufficient to meet its burden with respect to the requested
change. I therefore do not award this proposal.

Appeadix B

Appendix B sets forth the One-Time Startup Uniforms for Training and After Certification.
The Township's Final Offer is to Eliminate Appendix B.

The PBA did not comment on this proposal. The burden is on the Borough to prove the need
for the requested change in the Agreement. The Borough has not submitted evidence sufficient to meet

its burden with respect to the requested change. | therefore do not award this proposal.
Article VI, Clothing Allowance

Article V1, Clothing Allowance provides for a $950 annual clothing allowance for employees

hired prior to July 1, 1992 and a voucher system and allowance for those hired after July 1, 1992.
The PBA propose a Five Hundred Dollar ($500.00) annual Clothing Allowance for the purpose
of purchasing and maintaining necessary clothing and equipment.

The burden is on the PBA to prove the need for this change in the Agreement. The extemal

comparables alone, while relevant, do not justify a change in the Agreement. I therefore do not award

this proposal.
Based upon the 16g criteria and record before me, | respectfully enter the terms of this Award.
